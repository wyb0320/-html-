Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any
participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the
entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express
written permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford,
President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President,
Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks.
Following their comments, we'll take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2020. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties,
including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott's operations and
financial results that may cause actual results to differ materially from those
indicated in the forward-looking statements.

Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other
factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk
Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019,
and in 1A Risk Factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended March 31, 2020. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any
revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or
developments, except as required by law.

Please note that financial information provided on the call
today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing
operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial
measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless
otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth,
which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.

ROBERT B. FORD, CEO, PRESIDENT, COO & DIRECTOR, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining
us. I hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe during these
challenging times.

Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.57,
which is significantly above analysts' expectations. Based on our performance
and momentum for the first 6 months, along with our expectations for the
remainder of the year, we now forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least
$3.25 for the full year 2020.

As I stated on our last earnings call, we anticipated this
past quarter would be our most challenging of the year. At the start of the
quarter, many areas of the world were under shelter-in-place restrictions,
which led to the postponement of elective medical procedures and sharp declines
in routine diagnostic testing.

Encouragingly, as we progressed through the quarter, we saw
steady improvements in both testing and procedure volumes across our
hospital-based businesses. At the same time, our more consumer-facing
businesses, which include diabetes care, nutrition and established
pharmaceuticals, continued to be resilient in this environment, collectively
growing more than 9% in the first half of the year.

Throughout this time, our supply chain has remained
resilient. Our financial health has remained strong, and we've continued to
advance our pipeline and strengthen our long-term growth platforms with several
recent regulatory approvals, including U.S. approval of Libre 2 as an ICGM,
which sets a new standard for accuracy and performance and includes a new
pediatric use indication; CE Mark approval of TriClip, the world's first
minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve. This is
a new market opportunity for our structural heart business that has the
potential to be a significant area of growth over the next several years. And
U.S. approval of Gallant, our next-generation heart rhythm devices that feature
Bluetooth connectivity for continuous remote monitoring, which is a capability
we've been integrating across our device portfolio over the past several years,
including FreeStyle Libre, our continuous glucose monitor; Confirm, our
implantable cardiac monitoring device; CardioMEMS, our leading heart failure
monitoring system; and several other cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices
across our portfolio.

These connected care capabilities allow for better ongoing
engagement between patients and their health care providers. And this benefit
has never been more evident than in today's pandemic, where virtual care has
become necessary to safeguard against exposure between physicians and patients,
while continuing to manage and implement medical interventions when they're
needed.

I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail
before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition where sales
increased 3% in the quarter. Strong U.S. and international growth of Ensure,
our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, led to global adult
nutrition growth of around 7.5%. In pediatric nutrition, sales were led by
global growth of PediaSure and Pedialyte, our market-leading oral rehydration
brand, which was offset by challenging conditions in Greater China.

Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, sales were
relatively flat, following strong growth in the first quarter when we saw
increased demand in late March during the early phase of the pandemic. Over the
last couple of months, we've seen the virus spread and impact market demand in
certain emerging countries such as Russia, Brazil and Colombia. Through the
first half of the year, EPD achieved mid-single-digit sales growth, and we
anticipate a similar growth profile for the second half of the year.

Turning now to Medical Devices. As I mentioned earlier, over
the course of the second quarter, we saw steady improvements in procedure
volumes across our cardiovascular and neuromodulation portfolio. For example,
at the end of June, our procedure volumes had rebounded to approximately 90% of
pre-COVID levels on average in the U.S., which represents a significant
recovery compared to procedure activity at the beginning of the second quarter.

In Diabetes Care, sales grew nearly 30% in the quarter led
by FreeStyle Libre growth of 40%. As I mentioned earlier, we obtained U.S. FDA
approval for Libre 2 during the quarter. Now approved for both kids and adults,
Libre 2 sets a new standard for accuracy, including when glucose levels are in
the lowest range, which is critically important in order to avoid going into
hypoglycemia. This leading accuracy profile results in superior alarm
performance with fewer false alarms than other systems, which can be
frustrating, but more importantly, significantly fewer missed alarms, which can
be critical to avoiding dangerous glucose levels.

Libre 2 maintains all the market-leading features that Libre
brand is known for. It's smaller, easier to use and longer-lasting than other
glucose monitors, and its value proposition is unparalleled with a cost profile
that is not a burden to health care systems. We'll launch FreeStyle Libre 2 in
the next few weeks at the same price as the current available FreeStyle Libre
14-day system, continuing our commitment to make Libre affordable and
accessible to as many people as possible.

I'll wrap up with our Diagnostic business, where sales grew
7% in the quarter. Similar to what we saw in medical device procedures, testing
volumes in our underlying diagnostic business, which excludes COVID-19 tests,
rebounded to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels by the end of the second
quarter. Over the first half of the year, we've developed and launched several
COVID-19 tests across our testing platform for both laboratory and rapid
point-of-care settings. To date, we've sold about 40 million tests across all
our platforms in countries around the globe.

As we think about the continuum of diagnostic testing for
COVID-19 going forward, we see the environment unfolding across a few phases.
To date, we've largely experienced the pandemic phase where testing has been
prioritized for essential professionals such as health care workers as well as
symptomatic patients. Molecular testing, which detects if someone currently has
the virus, has been in high demand during this period.

With the phased easing of shelter-in-place restrictions,
we're entering a new phase where continued testing of symptomatic patients will
start to overlap with broader surveillance testing of asymptomatic patients in
order to better track, understand and contain the spread of the virus until we
have broad vaccine availability. So in addition to molecular testing during
this period, we would anticipate increased demand for other types of tests,
including both antigen and antibody. As vaccines become available, we would
anticipate continued surveillance testing to monitor and assess for both natural
and vaccine-related immune response, which would be followed by a steady state
of ongoing monitoring and tracking of vaccine protection.

So looking across the spectrum, it's clear that the need for
testing is large and it isn't going away. I'm incredibly proud of the work of
our scientists as well of our manufacturing, supply chain and business teams
are doing to lead in this area as we fight this pandemic.

So in summary, while as we had expected this quarter was a
challenging one from a growth perspective, we significantly exceeded
expectations and more importantly, exited the quarter in a much stronger
position than we entered it. We continued to advance our pipeline and achieved
several important new product approvals during the quarter. And we've continued
to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID-19, which is significant
and expected to carry forward beyond this year.

I'll now turn the call over to Bob. Bob?

ROBERT E. FUNCK, EXECUTIVE VP OF FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all
references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic
basis.

Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter
declined 5.4%. Our adjusted gross margin ratio was 56% of sales. R&D
investment was 7.3% of sales. And adjusted SG&A expense was 30.7% of sales.

Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.8% on
second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar weaken versus
several major currencies, which resulted in a favorable impact on sales
compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our
earnings call in April. Based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to
have a negative impact of approximately 2% on our full year sales.

Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 17.7% reflects the
aggregate adjustment to align our tax rate for the first half of 2020 with our
revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15.6%. This is higher than the
estimated range we provided in January due to a shift in our geographic and
business income mix caused by COVID-19.

Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to briefly
discuss a couple of items related to our capital allocation strategy. We ended
the second quarter with approximately $5 billion of cash and short-term
investments, which represents an increase of more than $1 billion compared to
the end of the first quarter. The increase includes the impact of a bond
offering we executed in June. We intend to use the proceeds from that offering
to pay off debt that matures in September. Following that, we have no other
debt payments due until mid-2022, which only further enhances our financial
flexibility.

In June, we also announced our 386th consecutive quarterly
dividend payment, an impressive track record that dates back to 1924. This year
also marks the 48th straight year that Abbott has increased its dividend
payment, making Abbott a long-tenured member of the S&P 500 Dividend
Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have increased dividends
annually for at least 25 consecutive years. Our consistency and commitment to
paying a dividend is a hallmark of Abbott's identity, and our strong financial
position allows us to continue that track record even during challenging
economic times.

With that, we'll now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question
comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS, ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on a much better-than-expected quarter. Maybe we
could start at the top. With 2Q coming in better but still a decent amount of
uncertainty about the balance of the year and the recovery trajectory, what
gives you the confidence in providing an EPS floor here of at least $3.25?

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure, Robbie. Thanks. Well, I'd say it's not
one single factor. It's really more of a collection of factors here. And I
think it -- that speaks to really the power of our diversified model, the
diverse strength of all of our different businesses.

So without a doubt, the Q2 EPS beat, which was pretty
significant, factors into that. I think some of that really was driven by --
there's some impact there of the challenges of forecasting that I think we all
had in April. But a good portion of that beat really comes from strong
performance across the businesses. I mean if you look at our 4 businesses, 3
out of -- 3 of them, 3 out of 4 of them are actually posting mid-single-digit
growth for the first 6 months of the year.

But as you look at the base business and think about base
business as ultimately Abbott without COVID testing, I think we saw a nice
recovery in the second quarter. Yes, there's probably still some uncertainty,
but I think we saw a real nice recovery across our base business. If you look
at the diagnostic and the device businesses that were probably more impacted,
we -- as I described, we exited June with about 90% pre-COVID -- at pre-COVID
levels. So -- and that was on average.

I can tell you, there were some markets or some segments of
our portfolio that we actually saw growth in the month of June. So -- and that
happened I'd say, both in the U.S. and internationally. And that's important
because obviously, there's maybe some concerns of resurgence here in the U.S.,
but a large portion of our sales of these businesses are concentrated
internationally, too. And we're not seeing those same concerns in those
markets.

And nutrition was interesting too, I would say, as I look at
that base kind of recovery or that base trend in Q2. I mean we thought that
there could be some impact of pantry stocking in Q1 that drove nutrition
performance. We actually did better than that, and I think part of that was
some stocking. But what we've now seen through some of the share charts, Rob,
is that we picked up share in both pediatric and adult nutrition.

So again, nice recovery, nice performance of the base
business in Q2, and I see that momentum carrying forward to the second half. I
mean we've got a lot of product launches, label and reimbursement expansions. I
can go through some of them. We'll probably talk about them. But if you think
about Libre 2, I've got high expectations about that launch in the U.S. TriClip
and Tendyne, and these are product launches that we've started to roll out in
Europe. We've gotten great feedback in the first months of launch, and we
expect kind of good momentum for those products in that geography.

The NCD certainty, I think, now in terms of lease time lines
for MitraClip is a real big plus for us. And the Alinity expansion that we
continue to roll out, I'd say, a nice launch now of Alinity m in the U.S. and
we're using COVID here to jump-start that launch. So I'd say the combination of
nice recovery in Q2 and that momentum being powered through all these launches
and all these products that we've historically been talking about is a big
factor there.

And then I'd say finally, COVID testing, in my prepared
remarks, I talked a little bit about kind of the phases we're going to be
going. But ultimately, the demand here and the need will be with us for the
foreseeable future. So we've got a comprehensive portfolio, whether it's point
of care, whether it's core lab, whether it's lateral flow, different types of
tests, whether it's molecular PCR, antibody. So I think we really have a
competitive portfolio. And as we look at going into the second half of the
year, the competitive position combined with the demand that's going to be
there, we're going to be adding in the second half.

We'll be adding in terms of new tests, new formats. And also
important, we'll be adding in terms of manufacturing capacity, whether it's our
molecular platforms, whether it's our lateral flow platform. So we've been
working at manufacturer expansion during this quarter. So the notion here that
we're -- somehow our competitive position is threatened. I think that we --
we'll be adding competitive position. We'll be adding to it. And I see the
demand being there.

So you factor all this in, Robbie, you look at our beat, our
base business recovery in Q2 fueled by a lot of these kind of product launches
carrying that momentum forward, look at the acceleration of our COVID testing
across all of our platforms. You can then do some risk adjustments to some of
the points that you've made there about maybe some resurgence in some states.
But I felt that once you factored all that in, I felt confident about
reinstating our guidance, and I thought that a number of $3.25 was a good
starting point as we go into the second half.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS: Great. That's a lot of wonderful
color. Maybe if we could turn the second question to testing. And the 2 things
I wanted to focus on was the durability of the testing, not just for the second
half of this year, but as you think out beyond into 2021-plus, how durable is
the serology testing? And then second, if you could just give us an update on
where you stand in some of these other tests like the lateral flow test and
then anything else time line or product-wise you could comment on.

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. We spent some time looking at kind of
what that demand curve will look like. And obviously, our understanding now is
much better informed than what it was in March. I'd kind of highlight a little
bit the different phases that we'll see. And I think we're now moving into, I
guess, what I would call this more recovery phase here as some of these
shelter-in-place restrictions are being eased not just in the U.S. but globally
also.

And that's ultimately the part of the demand curve that I
actually see where most of the testing is going to occur, where you're really
here trying to do broad surveillance beyond just symptomatic or essential
workers. And I can see that phase lasting quite a bit actually, at least until
there is a proven kind of vaccine and vaccine availability.

And I think once that happens, we'll probably be getting
into what I would call like a vaccine phase here, where I still think you're
going to be needing to do surveillance testing of the virus. And that's
probably where I'll also think that we'll see an increase in serology and
antibody testing. And I see that, that's going to be an opportunity for us and
for other companies here that have the antibody test. I see that as being kind
of a real kind of demand driver on the serology side.

But I'd say as we look at this recovery phase that we're in
probably over the next kind of 12 months here, we're going to see broad
testing. And I think that, as I said, the platforms that we've built is
important because you're going to need to have different solutions for
different environments, different countries, different trajectories that
countries are on. So I like our position.

The other thing I would say is there's -- it's good to see a
lot of science and a lot of approvals of new tests and that's really important.
But as we all know, one thing is to ultimately solve the scientific question of
detecting the virus and finding the antibody, but you got to be able to have
the scale and the manufacturing footprint to be able to kind of scale up and
build. And I think that's what we focused a lot on over -- definitely over the
last 90 days is looking at the portfolio of tests that we have and adding our
manufacturing capacity to them. And it's not just one single site or one single
technology. We're really looking at bolstering manufacturing capacity across
all of our testing platforms.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from
Evercore.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR, MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL
EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on a solid execution here. So Robert, I
had a 2-part question or 2 questions, if you will, one on the product side, one
on the guidance.

Maybe I'll start on with the product side. I think you made
some bullish comments on Libre. There has been some confusion on the street on
the labeling side, on the ICGM label, but lack of an AID compatibility, if you
will. Maybe parse this out and explain how you see this Libre franchise in the
back half heading into next year. And in your perspective, do you think this
labeling is an issue or is this more of a sell-side issue?

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. Well, I mean, I think you saw -- let
me just start off then with kind of the trajectory here. I mean you looked at
our first quarter trajectory in terms of sales growth, new user additions as
measured by prescription data here in the U.S. and other data sources outside
internationally. And we were on a real strong kind of trend as we were going
into Q1. And then obviously, COVID had a little bit of an impact on our new
user acquisition growth rate.

I mean we were definitely growing new users through Q2, but
I think you could see in the data that we all kind of felt a little bit of an
impact in May. And that's probably just the impact of shelter in place where
patients weren't going to their physicians either to get their prescription or
just weren't going to the physician's office. But you see now, I mean, if you
look at the data, you see the pickup in the month of June. And you look at the
exit of June, we're probably very close to the rate that we were before we came
into COVID. And as I said, that was a rate that was growing really nicely in
terms of new users.

So I'm encouraged by that recovery there. I would say the
biggest encouragement I have here for the second part of the year is not only
that recovery, but obviously the approval of Libre 2 here in the U.S. I think
it's a product that's been long-awaited from physicians, payers, consumers, the
diabetes community. We had launched it in Europe about a year or so ago.

So I think I look at this, and it's not really a catch-up
for me. It's really setting a new standard, as I said in my comments, regarding
accuracy and performance. It's got the best accuracy across the board, whether
-- and again, this is a 14-day sensor versus our closest competitor being a
10-day sensor. But even with that longer range of use, better accuracy overall,
better accuracy in the low range and high range, better accuracy with kids and
adults, so I think that's very important.

And one thing that we wanted to make sure we got right here,
Vijay, was kind of regarding alarms. We had heard a lot about from consumers,
when we were developing Libre, the frustration with alarms. And so we really
put that feedback, really put the consumer really at the core, at the heart of
what we're doing to try and build the alarm. So not only does the accuracy have
better alarm performance, whether it's fewer missed or fewer false, but we
added a feature there, which is optional alarms. And it's the only CGM that
will have that where you can actually toggle between deciding when you want
alarms and don't want alarms. And I think that's an important mindset of how we
brought that consumer into it.

So I look at the combination of all this, Vijay, and I look
at the base core of the Libre brand, which I described. And I think the overall
value proposition is really second to none here. It's simple, easy to use. It's
connected, consumer-friendly device. It's been like that from day 1 once we
started the design process back in 2011. And I think one of the things that
gets lost a little bit in the feature battle sometimes that happens is the
outcomes. Outcomes are really important for the payers and for the physician
community. And we showed some really powerful outcomes data at the ADA this
year regarding A1c improvements for Type 2 patients that aren't on insulin, so
Type 2 patients on oral meds, and I think that's very important.

And we priced this for mass adoption. Our -- we don't
measure success here, at least not for this product, which we've always talked
about of being a mass market opportunity. We don't measure success of how high
of a reimbursement we got. We measure success about broad access.

So that as a framework, to answer your question on the AID,
it was interesting to see the reaction regarding that aspect of our approval. I
think it provided a lot of insight to some of the mindset here, some of the
people that follow this space. But listen, pumps are going to be important.
They're going to be an important segment of the market. The fully automated
pumps are pretty amazing technologies. They're great technologies. But for
context, these types of pumps, they really just compromise about 1% of the
insulin users here in the U.S.

So listen, we're very confident that we'll be connected to
the full assortment of all the pumps and pens, and we've got everything we need
here. But our vision and our strategy was much bigger and has always been much
bigger than that. We see this as a mass market opportunity that includes both
Type 1s, Type 2s, whether you're an insulin, non-insulin. And when you look at
the world like that, you're talking tens and tens of millions of people. So
we're excited about Libre 2 approval in the U.S. I think it sets a new
standard, and I got high expectations for it here in the U.S.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR: No, that's extremely helpful, Robert.
And one quick one on the guidance. I think you mentioned the exit rate on
procedures was at 90% of pre-COVID levels. If procedures remain at 90% in the
back half, one, are you still expecting to hit the $3.25 EPS number? That's --
I'm assuming -- and if that scenario plays out, it's going to be a mix impact
on margins just given devices have higher margins. So where is the upside
coming from? I think you mentioned something about antigen testing. I'm just
curious how you guys are thinking about that opportunity? And are you baking in
some upside from Libre as well?

ROBERT B. FORD: Listen, you've just basically rattled off
all the different factors that we've been looking at as we've looked at the
$3.25 kind of floor scenario for us over here. So all those things were
factored in.

We've actually had some countries where we're actually
seeing procedure growth. I mean in China, for example, which was probably the
tip of the spear, we actually saw procedure growth in the month of June and
healthy growth. So we factored all of that in there. We factored in the launch
of Libre 2 and the expectations that we think that we can drive in terms of new
user acquisitions and recovery there and we factor all this in.

And if you ask, where is the upside, well, listen, there
could be upside on all these factors here. I would say if you look at how we
built the forecast, a big portion of that is our manufacturing, our
manufacturing expansion. All of those are on time, they're on sequence. We've
allowed for a little bit of wiggle room there, I would say. But if they
continue to be on target and on time -- again, it's not one single expansion.
But if they continue to be on time, we could potentially see a potential for
upside to that number. But all these factors that you've laid out here, we've
sort of contemplated that in that $3.25 scenario.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR: Congrats again.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from David Lewis from
Morgan Stanley.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Robert, just another follow-up here on guidance. I guess I appreciate the $3.25
and obviously, you have some incremental profitability coming from the mix of
diagnostic testing. So is a good way of thinking about this year something
around mid-single-digit revenue growth in that range? And I wonder, if you
think about '21, and I know it's obviously pretty early, our math has you sort
of comfortably above pre-COVID levels. But any kind of qualitative commentary
you can give us on '21 would be, I think, helpful. I have a quick follow-up.

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes, sure. On your question regarding this
year, yes, I mean, I think the math would, at this level, would suggest that,
but -- that kind of mid-single-digit growth range. But as I said in the
previous question, depending on how some of this manufacturing ramp-up occurs
and the scaling of it occurs on the COVID side, the rolling out of our new
tests, we could be ahead of that. And that would then imply a different kind of
-- a different type of growth rate for the full year.

But even at the $3.25, we're definitely accelerating our
growth rate versus where we were at pre-COVID levels. So I think that the
combination of these factors here, I could -- we can see us potentially
entering next year with a high top line growth rate because of the combination
of a strong base business, a strong base Abbott with an additional layer here
of COVID testing.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Okay. And then just related to that,
Robert, just in terms of the diagnostic outlook here, we assume you're
expanding capacity. We have both the lateral flow tests coming. How should we
think about the capacity expansion on sort of m2000 versus ID NOW? I think your
business was sort of $600 million here this quarter. How can that scale up here
after the coming quarters? We certainly see an outlook here that's probably $2
billion to $2.5 billion for this year. But just give us a sense of where you
think the bigger opportunity lies between m2000 and ID NOW and what steps
you're taking there to expand capacity.

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes, I think that's a good range if you want
to dollarize it. And -- but I'd say, listen, we're looking at capacity
expansions across all the platforms.

So you mentioned m2000. We actually did a really good job at
doing -- at expanding capacity through the quarter. We're also looking at
expanding capacity for our Alinity m system, which I think is going to get a
really nice kind of jump-start here in terms of its launch with the COVID test.
It's a very attractive system in terms of kind of its features and -- its
competitive features, whether it's a throughput or ease of use, not only versus
m2000, but also versus other systems there.

We're also investing in ID NOW capacity expansion. We talked
a little bit about that when we came out with approval. We knew that 50,000
tests a day wouldn't necessarily be enough. It was a good start, but it
wouldn't be enough, and we've been working very diligently to be able to do
that.

And on the lateral flow side, we began rolling the tests
outside and in some international markets. We'll start to bring that here in
the U.S. And we think there's a use case for both an antibody and an antigen
test also. And we're investing capacity there also. So it's really not just,
I'd say, one kind of area, but really looking across the entire suite of
solutions here.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from
Barclays.

KRISTEN MARIE STEWART, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Thanks, Robert and the entire organization, for all that
you're doing on the COVID side. Just wanted to get a little bit more specific
on just timing for the U.S. for an antigen test, and if there's anything that
you can provide, just kind of more specifics on just the manufacturing capacity
or just kind of how big you think kind of the COVID testing opportunity could
be?

And just kind of correct me if I'm wrong, it just sounds
like -- and kind of my thought is that this COVID testing opportunity could
definitely be something that not only kind of sticks around into 2021, but
obviously, it could just be something more durable provided that not everybody
may be willing to sign up for a COVID vaccine if one is developed and
hopefully, obviously, one is developed.

And then if I could just have a follow-up too, if you could
explain a little bit more of the dynamics of what's going on in China with
Nutrition.

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. Let me just talk about kind of overall
demand there. I mean I agree with you, and that's how we see it. We see the --
that COVID testing will stick around. Even when you have a vaccine, I think
that I can see patients going to a physician's office with a fever, and they
want to know is it influenza, is it the flu, is it COVID? So yes, so we think
that the capacity that we're building is not only for, I'd say, a high demand
during the next 12, 18, 24 months here, but we do the -- a steady state, as I
said, that it will continue to be there.

Regarding your question on antigen, I won't give kind of
specifics in terms of timing. What I can say, and I talked about it in Q1, is
that we've really looked across our entire agnostic platform and not only the
instrumented side, but the non-instrumented side as it relates to lateral flow
testing. As you know, a lot of this lateral flow test came with the acquisition
we did of Alere, and we're intending to maximize that scale that came with the
acquisition. So we feel good about the test that we developed for the antibody.
We're rolling it out.

The antigen side, again, it's going to be -- we've been
working very hard on this. And I think it will just fall into the same kind of
bucket and value proposition here where we'll have a lot of scale to be able to
use this, produce a reliable test that's easy to use, that's affordable. I
think that's the critical aspect here. If you want to get some more mass
screening, more mass volume, the tests need to be more affordable. And one of
the ways you do that is you remove the restriction on the instrument, so -- or
requiring an instrument. So we're working on that test, and we've been building
capacity for it. So -- and that's factored it a little bit into our guidance.

I think you had a question on Nutrition, right? Yes. So
specifically, in China, yes, it's been a tough market, I'd say, for a lot of
companies, I'd say, especially some of the multinational foreign companies.
We've also seen a little bit of a decline there in birth rates, so that's kind
of slowed the market growth down a little bit. So -- but it's -- we're not
overly dependent on China Nutrition within Nutrition. And obviously, within
Abbott, our Nutrition business has been pretty resilient in the quarter. We
actually saw some pretty strong growth in pediatrics in some of other Asian
markets, too.

So listen, it's an important market for us. It's about 7% of
our Nutrition sales. The market conditions are shifting there a little bit. And
we'll continue to be competitive as we can there with our new product launches
and innovations that we're launching. And we'll see that dynamic, I think,
still kind of play out a little bit here in the next quarter or so until we can
get some of our new launches kind of rolled out.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from
Crédit Suisse.

MATTHEW STEPHAN MIKSIC, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, CRéDIT
SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just maybe changing gears a little bit, if you
could talk a little about some of the pipeline products that -- recently
approved and in the pipeline and time line, like the CE Mark for TriClip and
Tendyne for tricuspid and mitral. Maybe how to think about those products
adding to the growth in the back half and into early '21. And then for the
pivotal for Amulet, the NCD for CardioMEMS, what's different this time on that
product, which was kind of ahead of its time last time? Maybe just help us
understand how to think about or model those. And then I have one follow-up.

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. Well, we've been investing strong and
heavily in the structural heart business. And I think your -- you've just kind
of mentioned a lot of a lot of the output of those investments as we're
building the portfolio and the pipeline of our structural heart business. I
would say, MitraClip is still in the early innings. And I think that we've been
working hard to kind of expand that market.

And think about the NCD coverage here in the U.S., I mean in
the U.S., we did close to 12,000 procedures last year, and the NCD is going to
give us opportunity to target 250,000 procedures. So I think -- I still think
there's a lot of opportunity in the mitral space, in the repair side.

Specifically, on TriClip, listen, I think this is a great
opportunity for us. We got a lot of feedback from the physician community about
wanting to see a repair system for the tricuspid area. They were trying to get
there using the MitraClip, but it's a difficult area to get to. So we took a
lot of the feedback here and redesigned the delivery catheter for the clip to
be able to get to the tricuspid area. And we've got CE Mark. We've launched it.
We've gotten great feedback in terms of its -- the biggest challenge was
getting there in an easier way. And I think that the TriClip with the redesign
has kind of helped that.

I think it's about a -- think about the market size here.
It's probably about 1/3 of the size that I think of the mitral repair market.
That's how we've looked at it. And it's going to take a little bit of time to
develop. If you think about how we developed the mitral repair market, you need
to build a steady base of experienced users here to build good data on its
efficacy and then you start to kind of roll it out.

So I think this is really in the early stages here. We've
got some growth baked in, in the second half of this year. But this is probably
a multiyear kind of growth here for us, but it's an exciting one given our
position that we have in mitral.

On Tendyne, this was an important play that we made. We knew
that we wanted to be a company that had a broad suite of solutions in the
mitral area. And having a repair would be one part of it, but then having a
replacement device would be another part of the value proposition. And right
now, we're the only company now that -- be able to offer that solution to our
customers to be able to repair, and if repair is not needed, to be able to have
a transcatheter solution for replacement.

So we got CE Mark in January. We started to roll it out,
again, gotten very good feedback. And we'll -- we don't have, I'd say, a lot of
sales baked into the second half year. We really want to kind of develop the
use, develop the data. Both these products, the TriClip and the Tendyne,
they're currently under trial here in the U.S.. Our projected launch here for a
Tendyne product in the U.S. is late in 2022, and the TriClip here in the U.S. sometime
in 2023. So we've got a nice kind of cadence here of product launches.

You mentioned Amulet. This is another exciting area for us.
It sometimes gets lost in the shuffle and the richness of the pipeline of this
division here, but it's one that is not lost with me or with the management
team here. We've completed our enrollment, and now we've got an 18-month kind
of end point. So we'll expect to file by the end of this year and have a launch
sometime in 2021. And that will be a nice kind of growth opportunity as we go
into next year also.

MATTHEW STEPHAN MIKSIC: Terrific. And then just one
follow-up, if I could, on EPD and emerging markets. I know it's a little bit
more of a narrow geography to think about, but maybe similar to the way that
everyone was trying to sort of gauge the recovery or the way that COVID sort of
paces through the developed markets in Q2. Any sense of how to think about the
cadence of -- are we at a trough point? Or should we trough the impact in
August here or in this quarter in EPD and in emerging markets?

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes. So we saw a little bit of softness in
Q2, as we discussed. I think it's partially due to some of the purchases that I
think were pulled forward a little bit in late March as it relates to kind of
the quarantine mandates in certain countries. If you look at our Q1
performance, it was over 9%.

So I think what we've seen here is once we saw the data, the
data comes here a little bit of a lag to us. We were able to kind of see what
happened. And you kind of see this contraction, sharp contraction in the market
kind of in the March, probably more April, May kind of time frame here. And
early indication starts to show a little bit of a bounce back in June, but it's
not going to be -- you can't make a definitive conclusion across all markets
because they're all at different phases.

So I think right now, probably the ones that are being hit
the most are probably kind of Russia and Brazil. But we actually saw, similar
to devices, we saw a nice recovery in China in our EPD business also and saw
the kind of growth rate that we had been seeing. So double-digit growth rate in
the quarter in China.

So I guess what I'd say is the impact of quarantine and the
virus, it kind of moved from China, started moving east. And I would say kind
of the emerging markets were probably the most laggard part of that movement.
And I'd expect to see them come back in a similar fashion in terms of some of
the developed markets that we saw in devices and diagnostics also. So...

OPERATOR: Our next question comes Joanne Wuensch from
Citibank.

JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH, MD, CITIGROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION:
A very solid quarter. A couple of very quick questions. Can you give us an
update on Libre 3 and when you're thinking of the timing of that? Can you also
comment on how you're thinking about the run rate for MitraClip, particularly
with COAPT data behind it and now CMS coverage in front of it?

And then lastly, expense management. I got the impression
from some of your comments that you're leaning in on some investments. And if
there's anything that you can give us regarding big picture and/or the cadence
on that, that would be great.

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. I guess I would take your first
question on Libre 3. We've gone through a long journey here, so I think I want
to prioritize a little bit on Libre 2. But what I will say is the following.
We've always said that Libre was a platform product. We've always said that we
would have different iterations.

Libre 3 has been in development for some time. But I'm not
going to provide any details on product capabilities or time lines as it
relates to this point. My focus here is going to be really to maximize kind of
Libre 2 launch. But we do have a team that's been working on it, and we're
excited about it. And when we have more details to kind of share, we will
share.

Regarding MitraClip, yes, it was an interesting quarter for
sure. We saw a pretty sharp decline in clip procedures in the month of April
and probably about half of May. Then we started to see a nice kind of ramp up.
And so we exited Q2 in June with about 85% of where we were in pre-COVID
levels, and that continues to kind of trend up.

So I think you've -- you talked about kind of a key growth
driver for us. The NCD is an important part. I'm glad to see the process moving
forward. I think it represents a significant growth opportunity for us. I think
it more than doubles the U.S. market opportunity, as I said. And it's nice to
see that we could have an expected time line here that could potentially result
in an NCD approval at the end of the quarter. So I'm -- as I said in the
previous question about the structural portfolio, we've got a lot there, but
MitraClip is still in its early innings, and this is a great opportunity here
for us.

Regarding your question on spending, we've been careful
obviously about spending. And obviously I think you see a natural cadence of
less spending, whether it's travel and stuff like that, that we saw. But -- and
so that just naturally happens. But we've paid a lot of attention to R&D
and R&D spend and ensuring that not only do we not slow down our programs,
but are there other opportunities that we have to be able to accelerate them,
and we have been looking at that.

I think some of the challenges and some of the R&D spend
is that some of that spend is these clinical trials. So obviously, that -- with
some of the follow-ups, enrollments slowing down, you'll see that. But we've
tried to take some of that favorability and look at product development side to
be able to continue to build our pipeline, build our sustainable kind of growth
story. So yes, that's got a lot of attention and focus from me and the
management team and ensuring we don't lose the opportunity on the R&D side.

And then the other investment we've been making, as has
probably been pretty clear, is we're putting in a lot of manufacturing
capacity. That includes not only capital, but also project expense. And we're
managing those opportunities very, very closely also.

OPERATOR: And our last question comes from Matt Taylor from
UBS.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST OF MEDICAL
SUPPLIES & DEVICES, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I really had
just 2 follow-ups on 2 of the bigger themes here. So one is on the floor of
$3.25. It seems like you've been very thoughtful about how you've layered
together all these different moving parts for the second half of the year to
get to that floor assumption.

I guess my question is kind of taking the inverse of that.
So what would have to happen, what would have to go wrong for you to not
achieve that floor? Would things have to get significantly worse? Maybe you
could just speak to that.

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes. I mean, listen, we've looked at every
-- a lot of different scenarios here, Matt. We've got a lot of great data that
we -- that's pretty proprietary to us. I mean I think I mentioned this in the
last quarter where a lot of the laboratory testing that happens on our systems
in the hospitals, we get to see that data every day, every night and we've been
aggregating it. And we look at not only the volume of tests that are being
done, but we also look at the type of different tests that are being done.

And so I think we've got a pretty good insight in terms of
what's actually happening in the hospitals beyond just the headlines. Those are
important, but we haven't relied on headlines or models to do this. We've
really looked at it at a very granular level using the assets that we have to
be able to kind of put our own forecast together.

On the device side, the way our compensation is struck with
our sales reps, they've got to log their procedures. So we have a fairly
accurate representation of the kind of procedures that are occurring at the
hospital. So we've factored all this in and factored in the different components
of our manufacturing of COVID. And that's why I feel confident, again, in
reinstating and reinstating at $3.25.

So what you're trying to figure out is what needs to go
wrong here. I think even if there is a shutdown, another shutdown, which I personally
don't believe will be there, I think we know a lot more now. The hospitals know
a lot more versus what happened in the first shutdown. And I think we're going
to have a lot of manufacturing capacity to be able to deal with that from a
testing perspective.

And then you also have to have that same granularity not
just in the U.S., so looking at different states. But you also have to look at
it around the globe. And around the globe, there are different countries on
different situations, too. So...

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR: And then maybe one other follow-up.
So you talked about Libre 2 and all the exciting aspects of it. I was wondering
if you could at least qualitatively talk about the kind of acceleration or
pickup or additional opportunity that you see for that in the second half of
the year? And are you going to immediately be able to blast that out? Or is
there some kind of conversion time for you to get up to full speed on the
manufacturing of the new product?

ROBERT B. FORD: Well, on the manufacturing side, I'll just
answer that quickly. I mean you know that we've been investing in
manufacturing, manufacturing capacity and scale. We knew that was going to be
an important aspect for our strategy when we look at it as a mass market. So
from a manufacturing standpoint, we don't have that issue. We've got teams that
are already kind of building product, putting them in boxes, ready to start
shipping them to wholesalers and retailers here in the U.S.

Regarding kind of qualitative assessment of the opportunity,
I mean, I guess, I'll just go back to there's -- you can look at the
penetration of CGM in the U.S. here. And again, it depends on the kind of lens
you want to look at. If you want to look at it through the lens of AID systems
and connected pumps, you're going to have a market. If you're going to look at
it through the lens of at least how we're looking at it, which is mass market,
Type 1s, Type 2s, whether you're on insulin or whether you're not on insulin,
you're looking at a large -- you're looking at 15 million, 20 million people
here in the U.S. And you can look at the amount of users we have. You can look
at the amount of users that the other systems in the market have. And you can
add that up and you can say, "Okay, there's a lot of opportunity here for
that kind of growth."

The question is what is the product that best suits that
kind of penetration, that more mass market penetration. And I'll make the case
not because I've been with this product for a while. But I'll make the case
based on what I've heard from payers, what I've heard from the system that
ultimately have to pay for it, that Libre has got everything -- Libre 2 has got
everything it needs to be able to kind of accelerate that penetration.

And I'll point to the study that we published at the ADA
with a Type 2 non-insulin user. I mean that is a significant A1c reduction for
people on oral medication that you probably don't see in terms of other studies
with other drugs. So I think Libre has shown that it is just as effective at
providing outcomes for type 2 patients that are on oral medication versus those
that are on pumps. So I'm very bullish about the opportunity that we have for
Libre 2 in the U.S. as I am for Libre as a whole in -- around the globe.

So let me just wrap up here then by just -- we knew that Q2
here was going to be our toughest quarter of the year, and we beat those
expectations. I think part of it was probably some difficulty in forecasting.
But a good portion of that was our performance, our strong performance across
our businesses. We can see a base business that's -- if you exclude the COVID
test, we've got product launches, we've got channel expansions, new
reimbursement claims. So we continue to forecast a steady acceleration, a
quarter of work-over improvement of our base business.

You then have the COVID testing, which, as I said, I think
will be here with us for the foreseeable future. Not only do we have a very
complete portfolio, we're going to be adding to it, but we're also investing in
manufacturing capacity and scale. And I think that's an important role here to
play, an important role to play in meeting that demand.

So a floor of $3.25 I thought was a good place to start as
we reinstate our guidance. But if you look at our product launches, both U.S.
and internationally, our manufacturing expansions and depending how that goes,
we could see a situation where we're heading in next year with a very high top
line growth rate and really compromised here of a strong base Abbott business
with now an added layer of growth from COVID testing.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER: Okay. Thank you, operator, and
thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference
call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central
Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning, and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)
This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants'
questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call,
including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott.
It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written
permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford,
President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President,
Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening
remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2020. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties,
including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott's operations, results
and financial results. This may cause actual results to differ materially from
those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive,
governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's
operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on
Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2019. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to
forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments,
except as required by law. Please note that financial information provided on
the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for
continuing operations only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless
otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth,
which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.

ROBERT B. FORD, CEO, PRESIDENT, COO & DIRECTOR, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining
us. As everyone here knows, we haven't seen a quarter or any time quite like
this before. This global environment is unprecedented in our lifetimes. Before
we get into the details of the quarter, I want to take a moment to thank our
employees, our customers and our suppliers, all of whom are making
extraordinary efforts to keep systems working and to maintain supply of our
critically important products for the people who need them.

This moment has strongly underscored 2 fundamental things to
me. The first is the biggest and most important, and that's the essential
nature of health and health care. Times like these make very clear what truly
matters the most. The second, to bring it closer to home, has to do with the
nature of Abbott. We've been in the business of improving people's health
through medical innovation for more than 130 years, and it's in moments like
these that the importance of our mission becomes even more critical: delivering
for the people that depend on us.

I've been extremely impressed, though, not at all surprised,
by the way my colleagues around the world have stepped up to this moment. As
you know, we've quickly developed and launched 3 diagnostic tests for COVID-19:
2 for the laboratory setting and 1 for rapid point-of-care testing. At the same
time, our teams in every business and around the world have been making
extraordinary efforts to keep our operations running and our supply chains
moving and to undertake the thousands of processes to make our vital products
and get them to the people who need them. And we're also donating both funding
and products to support frontline health care workers, families and communities
to meet the challenges of this pandemic. I think this speaks to a well-known
attribute of Abbott's culture: We're execution-oriented, and we could be relied
on to deliver when it matters the most because we know how important our work
is, that lives depend on us, and we take that very seriously.

Our diversified business model is a true strength in times
like these. It's a model that has served our shareholders and the company very
well. Under normal circumstances, it provides more opportunities for growth.
And in situations like this, it helps to dampen the impact by ensuring we're
not overly reliant on a given business, product or geography. Overall, our
sales grew nearly 4.5% on an organic basis in the first quarter.

Looking across our portfolio. Some parts of the business
faced challenges, others have been relatively stable, and still others are
performing at high levels to meet new demands. Beginning in February, as China
implemented quarantine restrictions and nonemergency health care activities
were postponed, we saw sharp declines in both cardiovascular device procedures
and routine core laboratory diagnostic testing volumes in that country.
Encouragingly, over the course of March and the first 2 weeks of April, we've
seen a steady improvement in procedures and testing volumes in China from the
lows we saw in February.

As the virus spread geographically, the impact initially
expanded to pockets of Asia and Europe beginning in late February, and more
broadly across Europe and the U.S. during the last few weeks of March. As the
health care industry shifted its focus to fighting the virus, we saw similar
impacts to our business as those we had seen in China. Based on our most recent
data points, while we haven't seen a rebound, we're starting to see some signs
of stabilization.

Importantly, while we're navigating the demands of the
current environment, we've continued to advance our pipeline and strengthen our
long-term growth platforms. Over the last few months, we've announced CE Mark
approvals of new products in important cardiovascular device areas, including
TriClip, the world's first minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky
tricuspid heart valve; Tendyne, a first-of-its-kind device for mitral heart
valve replacement; and Gallant, our next-generation implantable cardiac
defibrillator.

In EPD and Nutrition, underlying market growth and share
dynamics remain in line with historical trends during the quarter, with the
exception of increased demand during late March in advance of shelter-in-place
restrictions in certain markets, most notably in U.S. Pediatric Nutrition. In
Diabetes Care, Freestyle Libre continued to add new users at a strong and
steady rate throughout the quarter as reflected by sales growth of more than
60%. We also continue to expand reimbursement coverage for Libre around the
world, including recently becoming the only continuous glucose monitoring
system to obtain reimbursement in Japan for people with Type 2 diabetes. And
just last week, we announced the availability of Freestyle Libre for
hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The Libre system allows frontline health
care workers and hospitals to remotely monitor glucose levels in patients with
diabetes in order to minimize exposure to COVID-19 and preserve the use of
personal protective equipment. In partnership with the American Diabetes
Association, Abbott has donated 25,000 Freestyle Libre sensors to U.S.
hospitals and medical centers in outbreak hotspots to help accelerate access to
the technology.

Before I wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our
ongoing efforts in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID-19. Abbott has long
been a global leader in infectious disease testing, so leading in this area is
a role we can and should play. In late March, we launched 2 molecular
diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19: one for our ID NOW rapid point-of-care
platform; and one for our m2000 laboratory platform. Over the past few weeks,
we've been actively working with government authorities and health systems to
deploy these tests to places of greatest need. And just yesterday, we announced
the launch of a lab-based serology test for the detection of the antibody IgG.
While molecular testing detects whether someone currently has the virus,
antibody tests determine if someone was previously infected. We already began
shipping these antibody tests and intend to ship 4 million tests in April and ramping
up capacity to 20 million tests per month in June and beyond.

But our efforts don't stop there. We're moving as fast as we
can to develop additional tests, including a lab-based serology test to detect
another important antibody, IgM, which we expect to launch in the near future.
I'd like to thank our outstanding scientists as well as our manufacturing,
supply chain and business teams. They've really stepped up to the challenge and
are doing extraordinary work to increase availability of diagnostic testing as
we fight this pandemic.

So in summary, this unprecedented situation underscores our
purpose and the strength of our diversified business model. The underlying
fundamentals of our business remains strong, and our manufacturing and supply
chain have been highly resilient. We've long planned for how to maintain
business continuity in the face of a global crisis, and our employees and
suppliers have risen to the challenge. And lastly, Abbott is contributing in a
significant and meaningful way by providing new test solutions across our
diagnostic platforms to help screen as many people as possible.

I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob?

ROBERT E. FUNCK, EXECUTIVE VP OF FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all
references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic
basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.

Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter
increased 4.3%. Our adjusted gross margin ratio was 58% of sales. R&D
investment was 7.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.2% of sales.
Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.8% on first quarter
sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen versus most
currencies, which resulted in a larger unfavorable impact on sales compared to
expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call
in January. Based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have a
negative impact of a little more than 3% on our full year sales.

As we announced this morning in our earnings news release,
given the uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, we're suspending our previously issued annual guidance for sales and
earnings per share. We're actively monitoring the situation closely, and we'll
provide updates as appropriate.

Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to briefly
discuss Abbott's overall financial condition. As this situation has reminded
all of us, unforeseen events can rapidly change the environment we operate in.
And our philosophy of maintaining strong financial flexibility is in place for
just these types of moments.

Overall, I'd say our financial health is strong. We ended
the first quarter with approximately $3.7 billion of cash and short-term
investments, and we have existing agreements in place that will provide
additional access to $5 billion, if needed. As you know, over the last couple
of years, we have put a heavy emphasis on strong cash flow generation and rapid
debt paydown following a period of strategic shaping. This focused effort has
positioned us with healthy leverage ratios and only a modest amount of debt
coming due over the next few years. It has also resulted in strong
investment-grade credit ratings. That said, we are prudently planning to ensure
we can withstand a variety of potential scenarios that may emerge over the
coming months.

As Robert mentioned earlier, our diversified business model
is a true strength in times like these. I would also add that our disciplined
and thoughtful approach to financial decisions and capital allocation
priorities are also strengths and that Abbott is well positioned to navigate
this challenge.

With that, we'll now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question
comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO,
RESEARCH DIVISION: And congrats on a good quarter, all things considered. Maybe
I can start with the 2 positives in the portfolio here. I'll ask them
separately. First, on diagnostics. Abbott's leading the way. You have 3
different tests: the ID NOW molecular tests, the m2000 SARS-COVID-19 test and
then the antibody test, which was just announced. I know a lot of people are
interested in the potential of all 3 of these tests here. So I was wondering if
you could give us an overview of where you are with the testing, the potential
revenue implications and volumes that you'll have. And any other tests that we
should be on the lookout for on the horizon here?

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure, Robbie. So yes, it was definitely an
intense first quarter here for our Diagnostic business, even though it doesn't
look like that in the sales number, right? We've got a core lab business that
had some declines and it -- given the similar dynamics that we saw in our
cardiovascular procedures as the hospitalization and procedures kind of came
down. And then on the other side of the business, we have our rapid and
molecular business where we did see positive growth in the quarter. And we
actually didn't have a lot of COVID test sales for those businesses in the
quarter. As you know, we got our approvals towards the end of the quarter, last
week or so in March. So the potential here for the COVID tests are more
significant for us in the second quarter here.

But our biggest motivation on the testing aspect here, the
key driver here is we want to help people. We want to help people get tested.
We want to help society move forward. We want to help workers get back to work,
people get back to schools, et cetera. So when you look at the diagnostic
platform, the suite of platforms and products that we have built over the last
20 years here, they've really been aimed at being able to do just that.

So in mid-February, when we saw that the virus was not going
to mimic what we had seen in maybe previous viruses, like a SARS or a MERS, for
example, and we saw that this was going to be something much more significant,
much more widespread, we assembled 4 different and independent R&D teams to
go about it in individual groups. I mean there was obviously some collaboration
between them, but we wanted them stand-alone going after 4 different types of
tests: a molecular lab test, a molecular point-of-care test, a lab-based
serology test, and a lateral flow serology test. And we did that not because we
thought that we needed 4 shots on goal here to try and get 1 or 2 of them to
get it. We understood, given our experience here, that all 4 of these tests,
all 4 of these different types of testing would be needed. All 4 of them had a
different value proposition. So if you look at the lab-based systems, they're
more high throughput, get a lot of tests done. There's a little bit of a
turnaround time there, 1, 2, 3 days, et cetera, but we knew we needed that kind
of testing volume. We also knew that we needed fast, immediate -- more faster,
immediate results, maybe with the notion of having some portability where you'd
be able to take the test straight to testing people, not having to restrict
them to having to go to a lab or a hospital. And we also knew that there was
going to be a need for mass volume screening. So when we look at the assembly
of these 4 different tests that we've been working on, that's the -- that was
the goal: to understand that there's a viral progression that occurs where in
the beginning, in the early stages, you need molecular testing to be able to
diagnose if somebody has the virus. And as the degrees (sic) [disease]
progresses and people start to build antibodies for that, you're going to need
a different type of test and in different formats of the test.

So I would say every single one of our programs here either
met or beat their target dates. And there's probably 2 reasons for that: One of
them is, I'd say, just a very passionate and committed scientific and
manufacturing team here that really went 24/7. I mean 1 of our teams split in 2
so they could go 24 hours a day, 10 days a week to be able to continue the work
and doing the work. So that's one key driver.

And I'd say the other one here, and we've talked a bit about
this, is a very collaborative, science-based approach of our work with the FDA.
Throughout every step of our development process, we worked real time with the
FDA, sharing with them our technology, sharing how are we going to do the
clinical, sharing with them the results, taking input and feedback from them on
a real-time basis. And I think the combination of those 2 factors really
allowed us to do this, at least these 3 tests here in record time.

And I think what you're seeing, at least what we see a lot
is the reward of that. It's very rewarding to see the vision that we had about
these different types of tests and different types of platforms being deployed
to the way that we had thought and envision them to be and then to get feedback
back. I mean the amount of stories that I've received from CEOs, from mayors,
from governors about our rapid test and how we envisioned that test rollout to
start off with frontline workers, whether it's an ICU nurse, an ER doctor so
that they could be tested if they had -- thought that they had symptoms,
they're going to have to be self-quarantined for 4 or 5 days until their lab
test would come back. And now with a rapid test in 15 minutes, they would know
whether they would need to get appropriate care or whether they could return to
the front line. And that's been exactly how we envisioned that product to work,
at least in our initial rollout.

We also -- we're shipping a lot of m2000. I mean we have a
lot of m2000s in the country, but we also began shipping them to some pretty
difficult areas where the turnaround time that we had heard from mayors and
governors was over 2 weeks. So now we can ship these boxes -- these lab boxes,
and they can do close to 500 tests, 470 tests a day and get results in 24
hours. So the way we've developed these tests, the way we've put them out to
the market, the way we've launched them, the way we've worked with the labs and
the hospitals is exactly how we had envisioned this.

Obviously, there's a lot of stories that I've, at least,
been seeing recently about the difficulty to find the tests, et cetera. And
what I would say there is we've done everything that we said we were going to
do. We've delivered everything that we said we were going to deliver.
Obviously, that is not enough. We still need to do more, and there's a need
here to manufacture more tests.

Scaling is important and we have -- to get these tests out,
we use high-precision, high-automated manufacturing process. And some of those,
we've been able to kind of utilize existing assets that we have to manufacture
it. In other cases, it's not enough, and we need to buy more. We need to set up
more. And that obviously takes some time here, but you have a committed,
dedicated team here that's really doing 24/7 type of work.

But on the ID NOW side, I mean, we made comment -- we made
commitments to manufacture -- start manufacturing 50,000 tests per day starting
April 1, and we're halfway through the month here already, and we've delivered
exactly that. And every day, I get to see the manufacturing and the shipment
output, and we haven't fallen behind that. And several days, we've beaten that
number and able to get more tests out.

And we've worked collaboratively with federal government,
with state government, with governors, with mayors. We provide everybody daily
reports on what we've made and where we've shipped the product. It's a
collaborative process to be able to allocate the tests to the areas that -- or
need it the most.

As I said on ID NOW, our first phase was to roll this out to
ensure that the frontline health care workers were tested and were protected.
And as we start to ramp up manufacturing for ID NOW, as we'll start to
implement those actions in the month of May, into June, we'll start to roll
this out into a second phase where we'll start to be able to test more of the
general population. And we started to work on some pilots here with CVS and
other retailers here to say, okay, how can we get this system out of the
hospital into more decentralized testing so we can test the general population,
whether it's in urgent care clinics, nursing homes, retail settings, et cetera.
So that's on target, on plan also.

On the m2000, we made a commitment when we got approval to
ship out 1 million tests during the month of March, and we did exactly that. On
the IgG, we just announced yesterday. We talked about shipping 4 million tests,
put a stake in the ground there. I got an update from my team. Yesterday, they
already have orders for about 1/4 of that as of yesterday. So we're moving fast
here. And we know that we need to play our role here in manufacturing and
getting as most tests out as possible to this platform that we've developed.

We've also been very clear about how we're selling the
product. We sell the product from our warehouse right into our customers. We
try to limit as much as we can the use of wholesalers and distributors. So
that's worked very well. We're making weekly shipments so there's no hoarding,
and we can get to as many people, as many customers as we can. And we're
selling all of these tests at the same selling price that we were previously
selling all of our other assays for these instruments. So the ID NOW COVID
tests, we're selling at the same price that we sell our ID NOW flu test and the
same for all of our other -- for our other assays and the other boxes.

So we're working on our last platform here, which is our
lateral flow serology test. This will allow us to scale up to numbers much more
significant than some of these that I've talked about. This falls into our
ability to kind of look at mass testing for the general population. They're on
time right now, and we're almost there.

So I would say we've got a promising Q2 ahead of us as it
relates to testing. I'm not going to try here and forecast exactly how this is
going to look like in Q2 right now. But it's clear that the demand for testing
is big. It's not going to go away. And I think that the team here has aligned a
portfolio of testing solutions that have a wide variety of different uses and
will play a key role in ramping up testing.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS: Appreciate the response. Very helpful.
And maybe just one other bright spot in the portfolio is Libre. This is a
nonprocedure-based recurring revenue product. You had great international
numbers. The U.S. number looked a little lighter this quarter, kind of flat
quarter-over-quarter. Maybe just help us understand the trends in that business
and how sustainable that is as people are away from their endocrinologists?

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. As I said, if you look at our script
data, if you want to look at the U.S. data, we had a very good quarter as it
relates to kind of script. And beginning of the year, I talked about how we
were deploying a lot of demand-generation strategies here, whether it was sales
force expansions, direct-to-consumer advertising, et cetera. And you can see
that those that follow the weekly Rx data, you can see that inflection point
starting in the first couple of weeks of January here versus where we exited.

So our scripts between Q1 of 2020 and Q4 of '19, the scripts
actually grew 35% sequentially, obviously, over 100% if you look at it over
year-over-year. So the sequential growth rate there that maybe you're referring
to is really focused here on just kind of timing of sales and sales shipments
in the quarter. I expect to see that shipment, selling mimic what we've been
seeing in our Rx generation in the U.S. that you saw in the first quarter. And
I think that speaks a lot to the value proposition of FreeStyle Libre. It is
not only is it accessible, affordable, but it's easy to use, it's easy to start
patients on the product. So I think that we've seen that play out here even
within the situation that we saw with COVID in the U.S.

And you're right in international business has done very,
very well, growing at very high rates, and that's off a very, very large base.
So I'm very pleased with the international business. I think there's more work
to be done there for sure. We're starting to roll out the Libre 2 product in
Europe and in the international markets a little bit more intentionally with
that expansion. I think we showed some of our accuracy data on Libre 2 in the
European conference beginning of this month, and I think that's going to help
fuel a lot of our growth also in the international markets, too.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from David Lewis from
Morgan Stanley.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Robert, just a couple of quick questions for me. I guess the first thing, just
sort of thinking about recovery. You gave some comments on China. But I wonder
where is China right now as a kind of a percent of prior normal. In the U.S.,
have you seen week over week, the business get softer. Has the U.S. sort of
reached some stabilization at a trough? And then just more broadly, how are you
thinking about sort of recovery kind of across the quarters this year? Any
qualitative commentary would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up.

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. So just on your question on China, I
mean, it's an important market for us, but we're not overly reliant on China.
But let me put the -- let me put your general demand question here, I think, a
little bit into context, and I'll kind of walk through what we saw in the
quarter geographically and across the businesses and then talk a little bit
about how we see the rest of the year going.

But if you look at our business and break them out into 2
groups, I would say, more hospital-based demand generation businesses and then
the second part, more consumer-based demand businesses, they're about 50-50 --
roughly 50-50 in size. And we don't tend to look at our businesses that way,
David. But I think as we looked at coronavirus and started to look at our
models, we started to look at this approach here by looking at hospital and
consumer base.

On the consumer-based side businesses, so you look at our
EPD business, our Nutrition business, our Diabetes Care business, all of them
performed in the quarter very, very well. They all performed in line with our
trends, with our targets, with our aspirations, with the execution of our
growth strategies. Obviously, the exception to that was some parts of our
Nutrition business, where we did see pantry loading as a result of some of --
towards the end of March there, where we saw a lot of consumers try to stock up
and get ready. But excluding that, all of them kind of performed well and on
target. And obviously, there was increased demand for some of these products,
and our supply chain was resilient, was able to fulfill them. So I see those
businesses kind of going forward, performing at the same kind of trend, at the
same rate that we have been seeing. Obviously, we might see a little bit of
Nutrition in the second quarter, adjust a little bit. But overall, I see these
businesses performing at the same kind of trend.

If we look at the hospital-based businesses, so think about
that as kind of the more core lab testing, our Cardiovascular portfolio, even
to some extent, our Neuromodulation business, even though it's not hospitals,
it's more ASC, we definitely saw a decrease in those procedures, in those
elective procedures and in that routine testing. And even within those, you see
some differentiation. So we didn't see our Heart Failure business get impacted
that much because those are life-saving devices versus an EP ablation procedure
that was more elective and could be pushed out. So -- but in general, I would
say, testing and procedures, we saw that drop.

We collect daily device implant data and we collect daily
hospital diagnostic testing data. And we collect it on a global basis. So I
think we've got a pretty robust set of information that we can look at here as
we start to observe kind of the trends that we saw in the quarter. And as we
shared, we're starting to see an improving trend here in China. It's not to the
level that we saw in our normal levels, pre-COVID, say, December, January kind
of rates. But they're definitely not as low as where they were in February. And
we're starting to kind of see them every week, get better and better and
getting closer to those levels that we saw pre-COVID.

We've seen other markets around the world, whether that's
Asia or some of the other European smaller markets there, where we've seen the
beginning of the same kind of recovery trend that we saw in China. So starting
to see some of the beginning of that recovery. And then in other markets, we're
seeing kind of just this flattening and a stabilization here that's suggesting
here that the speed of the virus is a little bit more controlled.

So if I look at this data, and we've looked at it various
different ways. We've run a lot of different forecast models and sensitivities
here. There's a couple of things that I can see ahead of us here, right? The
first one is Q2 will likely be our toughest quarter in the year, especially, I
would say, for our core lab business and our cardio and neuro businesses. This
will probably be our toughest quarter for those. And I think our consumer
businesses will continue to perform at the trends and dynamics that I just
explained.

The second thing that we can see here based on our modeling,
based on the data that we're seeing from -- that we're collecting on a daily
basis is that we can see a recovery into Q3 and into Q4 especially for these
more elective procedures. There are some that, yes, you can push out, but they
are important. They are life-saving. They are solving some significant
problems, whether it's a stent, a pacemaker, repairing a mitral valve. We will
see those start to come back the same way that we started to see in some of the
earlier markets that have kind of -- that they are further along in the
recovery. I don't believe that they're going to come back at the same speed that
they came down. But like I said, these are important procedures, and I do see
them coming back. I've -- talking to a lot of health systems, a lot of CEOs
from health systems, and they are -- they're already talking about how they are
planning to start to work with some of those elective procedures.

It will be a V-shape. I don't think it will be -- I think
the right-hand side of that V-shape will be definitely a little less steeper
than the left-hand side of that V-shape. But I think we're going to see that
recovery in Q3 and Q4, at least that's what our data is suggesting. Clearly,
it's quite possible that other industries might take longer to recover. But I
think for health care, the data our modeling here suggests the kind of recovery
that I've just described.

And the third thing we can see here clearly is that testing
is going to play a major role here at getting back to work, getting back to
school, getting people back to factories, back to distribution centers, et
cetera. And we know that this is a 24/7 type of work that our teams need to do
to be able to kind of scale up. And I think that the sales ramp and potential,
et cetera, is really going to be guided by our manufacturing ramp up and our
ability to kind of deliver on that manufacturing ramp up. And I think that
we've been batting at a very high average here based on the commitments that
we've made.

So when you look at all of that and you put all of this into
context here, we have decided here to suspend our guidance. We're usually right
here to the penny every quarter, and it's going to be -- right now, it's going
to be very difficult to be able to get that right to the penny going forward.
But I believe that we'll be in a position to give, I'd say, some more
qualitative update sometime in the quarter. And depending on how that goes, we
might be able to -- be able to give guidance in the second half here. So I've
looked at the consensus that's been put out there. I mean we beat the revised
consensus across our business. I'll leave the consensus where it is right now,
given that it is a pretty fluid situation. But I think we could do better. But
there's just too much it depends on right now for us. So we're going to keep on
focusing on what we're doing, and sometime throughout the quarter here, if we feel
that we're in a better position to be able to give some more qualitative
assessment and guidance, we'll do that.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Okay. That's actually very specific,
probably more than I hoped for. And then in terms of the second question, just
you've probably been less active on growth-oriented M&A these last couple
of years than some of your peers, but you're going to emerge from this pandemic
crisis with probably the strongest balance sheet in large-cap device. So how
are we thinking about your interest in -- buybacks, I imagine, are less of your
focus, but your interest in opportunistic M&A here coming out of this
crisis?

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. Listen, I'd say right now, we've done
a lot of work on our balance sheet over the last couple of years. We've talked
a lot about the work we've done to improve our leverage ratios, the work that
the organization has done to improve our cash conversion cycle. So yes, our
financial strength here is very strong.

As Bob talked about, we've got a strong cash position here
towards the end of the quarter, close to $4 billion. We have access to credit
facilities. And we've got businesses that are strong cash flow generators, and
that's going to be important as we go forward. We don't have a lot of debt
maturing or coming due here in the next couple of years.

So I don't foresee our capital allocation strategy here to
kind of really change at this point. Where -- we have a strong dividend, we pay
a strong dividend, and we're going to continue to do that. That's an important
part of our identity. We haven't done a lot of share repurchases historically.
Most of the time when we do that, it's really just to try and offset some of
the dilution. I think Bob and the finance team, I would say, is definitely
looking at our CapEx and our CapEx spending. I don't -- we'll probably see some
slowdown a little bit in that. And the team -- I know Bob is kind of working on
that. We'll see how that's going to look like but that will just be a factor of
getting the work done. And right now, there are some of our projects that
require people to be building sites, et cetera. So we'll continue to focus on
that. We'll continue to build our capacity expansions that we've talked about
in the past. But we'll probably see some phasing a little bit over there.

And on your question on M&A, I mean, I'm not really
looking at anything. As we talked about it, there's an opportunistic side to it
and then there's a strategic side to it. And on the strategic side, I just
don't see anything right now that fits what we want to do and where we want to
go. And quite frankly, our execution here -- again, going back and maybe this
sounds a little bit broken record here, but we've just got so many
opportunities in our existing portfolio to keep on focusing on, and now you
layer on top of that the opportunity we have on our testing platforms. So our
big focus here is on internal execution.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank
of America.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a couple of quick questions. First, I wanted to kind of
circle back to testing, specifically regarding the 2 COVID-19 tests that are
being run, on ID NOW and m2000. I just wanted to be super clear on where you
are today in terms of shipping capacity. Is it that 5 million per month that
you talked about? And also, can you give us a sense as we look forward, given
the critical importance of these tests, kind of where you'll be, say, maybe
midyear in terms of testing and shipping capacity?

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. On the testing side, I mean, we talked
about achieving a manufacturing ramp up here as we come out of the gates with
the ID NOW platform at about 1.5 million tests, and we're on target to do that
definitely throughout the middle of this month here. And we're making
improvements in the manufacturing process and adding more shifts, et cetera, to
be able to expand that to get to 2 million tests by June. And that's what we've
talked about. And right now, we're on plan, on target to be able to kind of
deliver on that expansion.

Obviously, we need more than 2 million of the ID NOW tests,
so we're looking at how we can ramp up. As I explained in the beginning, on the
first question, these manufacturing processes are highly precise, highly
automated, so that we can get the performance and reliability of the product.
So these involve making -- setting up manufacturing lines and you don't do
those in a week or 2 weeks. So there's a lot of work going on there, but we
know we need to -- we know that there's a need for more ID NOW tests.

And on the m2000, we made the commitment here to ship 1
million tests in the month of March, which we did. We talked about shipping 4
million tests in the month of April, and we're on target to do that, to manufacture
4 million tests, and we're on target to do that. We've moved the team along to
find ways that we can expand that, and the teams are working on that also. So
I'd say right now, that 5 million tests mark on those 2 tests is where we're
at. And as we make progress with our manufacturing ramp-ups, we will be clear
about what the market can expect from.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS: Great. And then one follow-up on the
same sort of topic. Congratulations on the new serology test that you just
announced. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about sensitivity and
specificity data relating to that test. And whether you think the high levels
that have been quoted are kind of sustainable when you think about general
population testing?

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes, to answer your question on the
accuracy. Right now, the label we have is, if you do the test 14 days post
symptoms, the sensitivity of the test is 100% and the specificity of that test
is 99.5%, and that's over 1,000 samples. So I think we've got a very, very
accurate, reliable test here to be able to work on. Obviously, if you try and
do this test 5 days after you've been exposed to the virus, your body hasn't
produced enough antibodies to be able to be detected at a reliable, accurate
level. So that's why when I talked about how we've set up our tests, the forms,
the different form factors, that the use of the antibody test is more to look
towards a couple of weeks after somebody has been exposed. Have they built
enough antibodies that they've defeated the virus? So that's the data.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from
Evercore.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR, MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL
EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations, guys. Two questions for me. So
one, maybe on the near term. I guess when you think about the serology test and
applicability to opening up the economy, there are some issues around
prevalence rates and false positives and is this now paving the way for a
second wave of infection. So maybe address that? I mean how these tests could
be deployed perhaps in helping us open up the economy? And one other -- when
you think about your employees getting back to work, what signs are you looking
for to completely open up workforce and let employees back?

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. I mean as I said, we have to look at
the suite of tests as not -- one test is not the panacea. You need to look at
the comprehensive suite of testing and deploy them in the right ways over here.
As I said, I think the serology test here is very reliable as we roll this out
for the antibodies. We're working on an IgG -- on an IgM antibody test also.

Obviously, as companies are thinking about coming back to
work, the way we're looking at this a little bit is, okay, we know that there's
going to be a little bit different -- work a little bit differently the way
we've historically been working. So maybe not a lot of big kind of meetings. 20
people, 30 people in the meeting rooms will probably be a little bit different
than that. I think we'll see people wearing masks. I think we'll see more
cleaning of door knobs and elevator buttons and all of that. And I think that's
ongoing right now. I think there are a lot of companies that are doing this
right now, and that seems to be working. So if you now add on to all of those
protocols kind of the lateral flow test here that's got a very strong
sensitivity, reliability, et cetera, and you add that on and you can test at
companies using an occupational health team, et cetera, that will be an
additional layer of security, of testing that will be on top of like
thermometers and everything I just described also.

So I think it's going to be an important tool. And I think
that we've talked about this a lot in terms of microclimates. We try to think
about everybody coming back at once, and then you use all this data that you
just referenced, prevalence and sensitivity and specificity, and you try and
look at that at very large populations. We need to think about it more in terms
of like a factory, an office building, a school. And then running these tests
will allow you to -- on top of what you are doing, provide another tool to be
able to assist companies and schools, et cetera, get people back to work. So I
think that's how, at least, we're looking at it, and I think how I've heard
other companies looking at how to reopen, how to get back.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR: Yes, that's helpful. And then maybe
one -- so a bigger picture question or maybe this is more -- help us understand
on how we should be thinking about the future. Because when I look at 2021, and
obviously, I'm not asking for guidance. We know '20 was impacted. But what is
the right base to be looking at procedure volumes, right? When you look at the
underlying rate of incidence and prevalence pool for disease states, those
really haven't changed. So if we don't have a, knock wood, a second wave of
infection coming in or next year being impacted, should we be looking at
procedure volumes in '19 as the base, the right base to build off? Or should we
be -- there are some issues on hospital capacity constraints. And should we be
looking at the depressed 2020 procedure numbers as the right base to looking at
how those numbers could track -- trend next year?

ROBERT B. FORD: Well, I can appreciate you trying to figure
out 2021 already, Vijay, but listen, I think it's pretty tough right now for us
to figure out how exactly Q2 is going to look like, let alone next year. But I
think you raised some of the unknowns here that really make it difficult to
predict how fast the economy recovers, how fast hospitals return to normalcy,
how does our testing platform and how's the testing environment evolved.

Listen, we're all hoping for a fast recovery here, but if it
takes longer, we'll have strong demand for testing. And that will continue to
help buffer the impact. I do think there's a lot of pent-up demand here on
cardiovascular devices and diagnostics. And I think hospitals are figuring out
how they're going to get back to work. I think there's a lot of patients that
are in need of care. And I think that -- I can't -- I don't know if we can
predict exactly when it's going to come back. But I do think that when it does
come back, I think you'll see these device procedures, which are extremely
important -- as truly important in the care continuum, et cetera, that we will
see them come back.

So that's probably my best answer for you is I believe that
we'll see a recovery towards the second half of this year in these elective
procedures. And you can kind of try and model out what kind of V-shape is it.
Is it -- does it look more like an L? Does it look more like a V? Is it
something in between, et cetera? But I think that's how, at least, we're
looking at the rest of this year.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST OF MEDICAL
SUPPLIES & DEVICES, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: So first
question, I just wanted to follow-up on the testing since it's so important and
certainly commend the team for their efforts in getting those out so quickly.
So it's 2 part. One is, you mentioned in the earlier remarks that there's been
a lot of commentary about difficulty in the testing market. It's not only due
to kits, but folks have mentioned swabs and reagents and other things like that.
I was just wondering from your perspective -- I'm sure you're getting a lot of
feedback on this. What do you think is the biggest challenge out there in terms
of getting access to testing now? And how do you see that improving over the
next weeks and months? And then on -- yes, go ahead, sorry.

ROBERT B. FORD: No. So on the question there of testing and
testing supplies and shortages there, I mean I think when you look at kind of
what we've done, I mean, we've made sure, obviously, that when we ship out our
test, they have everything they need to test, whether it's controls,
calibrators, whether it's swabs and ID NOW, those come together here. So from
Abbott's perspective, we're trying to make sure that they have everything that
they need.

I do think that some of the challenges you have is
potentially workflow. At least for us, we've got our m2000s. They're in
regional hospitals, regional labs, which is a good thing because you can now
have not only your big central labs doing a lot of centralization, but then you
can use the regional network to be able to get to test.

And I just think it's a workflow process here, how to get
the samples. I think a lot of hospitals might not want to be doing a lot of
mass testing into the hospital. So how do you collect the samples? And then how
you bring them into the hospital? And then how do you get them out? So I think
that's probably one of the bigger challenges. And I think that the team,
whether it's on the federal government side and also with a lot of governors, are
figuring this out. And they're sharing how they're doing it and sharing best
practices. And at least on our side, we're starting to see a ramp-up here on
the m2000. But there's obviously more that they can do.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR: Okay. And then one follow-up on
that. I think on Bob's question, you commented on the accuracy of the serology
test, which is high. Could you comment on the accuracy of the other tests, your
confidence in them with smaller samples that you had to get out quickly and the
relative importance of the 2 serology tests in determining who's had the virus
and who has immunity?

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes, sure. So on the molecular test, listen,
molecular test is the gold standard for accuracy. RNA testing, testing viral
load, et cetera, is the gold standard. And if you look at how we did the test,
obviously, it's -- it was worked in conjunction with the FDA, using a testing
model that was provided by the FDA. The tests are performed at 100% of the
expected outcomes in the samples for both negative and positive results. So I
think the ID NOW system is very reliable.

The other, m2000, we use levels of detection. And I mean,
you can go through levels of detection labels, and you could see the accuracy
and reliability of the m2000 versus the other systems that have been approved
also. So -- and as I said, the use of the antibody test is just going to be an
important tool in conjunction with kind of molecular testing to be able to
screen, test and manage the population. So we'll see how that's going to kind
of roll out, and it will follow kind of the vision that we've kind of thought
of, having both a lab-based system and a lateral flow-based system.

OPERATOR: And our final question comes from Larry Biegelsen
from Wells Fargo.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN, SENIOR MEDICAL DEVICE EQUITY RESEARCH
ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Robert, let me just
ask one multipart device question. On 2 milestones we're waiting for, the
MitraClip FMR, NCD, any update there? And of course, Libre 2, any update on the
status there? Just lastly, any other time lines in devices that could be
impacted by coronavirus would be helpful.

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure, Larry. I was waiting for the Libre
question. Let me answer your CMS question over here on secondary MR. As you as
you'd expect under these circumstances here, CMS has delayed the issuance of
the proposed NCD. We were previously expecting that to be mid-February. But
given the current circumstances, the delay here isn't really having an impact
on our business. I'm confident in the process. I'm confident that we've been
working with them and the different societies over here. And this will move
forward on the appropriate time.

On Libre 2, I guess I sound like a broken record here,
Larry, but what I'll say is, I'm very confident in the product the same way
that I've been saying. I'm confident. I mean I think some of you might have
seen the accuracy data that we published at the European conference beginning
of February. So I'm very encouraged about resolving these -- some of these kind
of open items here in the near future with the FDA. We're just working through
some finishing items. So -- but like I said, that's not holding back Libre or
Libre's growth here. So more to come.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN: Yes. Anything else though that we
should be aware of that could be impacted on the device side from a time line
standpoint?

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes, there's been some discussion on
clinical trial and clinical trial regulatory time lines here. Our near-term
forecast here wasn't really overly reliant on kind of any patient enrollment
end points. There's obviously been some delays in some of the enrollment, and
as we've seen a kind of mandate here to pause some of these procedures here. So
-- but I think once this is over, for the ongoing trials that have kind of
longer time lines here, we'll look at opportunities that we'll have to
accelerate enrollment and make up for some time here.

So let me just say here then, closing here. I think we had a
pretty unusual quarter here for us. I think you saw the strength of our
diversified business model come through here in true strength. Some parts of
the business, we did have some challenges, as I've described. Other parts of
the business have been pretty stable, and I think they'll continue to be pretty
stable. And then there are others that are performing at very high levels. And
I think we'll start to see on the testing side, how fast we can ramp up. The
team here has done an amazing job around the world, not only to develop the test,
but also the manufacturing, the supply chain teams across the world, across our
network have done an incredible job.

I think our -- I said our financial strength here is pretty
strong. I think we had that question here, and we'll continue to look at ways
to improve on that. And as I said, we believe that there is a recovery, and
we'll start to see that, I believe, in the Q3, Q4 time frame. I think health
care is a little bit different than you might expect from maybe other
industries. So once we get better -- a better sense of how that's going to look
like towards the second half of the year, we'll definitely be updating and
providing some more qualitative updates on that. So okay.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER: Good. All right. Well, thank you,

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning, and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any
participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the
entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express
written permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Ford, President and
Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and
Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks. Brian will discuss
our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, we'll
take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2020. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological
and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in item 1A,
Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Abbott undertakes no obligation to
release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of
subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that
financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and
line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless
otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth,
which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES D. WHITE, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD & CEO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. 2019 was another highly successful
year for Abbott. Our focused execution resulted in strong financial
performance, including ongoing earnings per share of $3.24, reflecting 12.5%
growth on an absolute basis and even higher growth when excluding the impact of
currency. All 4 of our businesses performed well, contributing to full year
organic sales growth of more than 7.5%, which is above the guidance range we
set at the beginning of last year. The successful year was capped off by a
strong fourth quarter with organic sales growth of 8.5%, including double-digit
sales growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Core
Laboratory Diagnostics, along with ongoing EPS growth of more than 17%.

Our consistent strong performance demonstrates that our
business model is working exactly as intended. We've built the company very
deliberately through a multiyear process to deliver superior results for years
to come. We've shaped our businesses to align with important trends to make
sure we're in the right places with the right products. And we've targeted
businesses that are focused on some of the world's greatest health care
concerns. For example, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are 2 of the most
significant health care challenges of our lifetime. They are chronic,
long-lasting and dramatically increasing in prevalence around the world.

Nearly every health care decision begins with a diagnostic
test. And this testing not only occurs in the traditional hospital setting but
also increasingly at alternate sites such as physicians' offices, pharmacies
and even at home. Proper nutrition is a foundational element of good health
across every stage of life, whether you're a newborn baby, a child striving to
grow or an aging adult working to overcome a health condition. And access to
health care continues to expand rapidly in emerging markets where 85% of the
world's population resides.

We've shaped our company to achieve scale and leadership
positions in all of these areas. The investments we've made and our focus on
execution are working. Our product pipelines are strong. Our operating culture
is strong, and we're well positioned to achieve sustainable strong growth for
years to come.

For 2020, we're forecasting another year of top-tier
financial performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales
growth of 7% to 8% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.55 to $3.65,
reflecting double-digit growth.

I'll now provide a brief overview of our 2019 results and
2020 outlook for each business. And I'll start with Diagnostics where sales
grew 6.5% in the fourth quarter, led by double-digit growth in Core Laboratory
Testing. The rollout of Alinity continues to go well in Europe where we're
winning new business at a high rate and successfully renewing existing
contracts that come up for bid. We continue to expand our rollout of Alinity
systems across multiple key markets, including the U.S. where last year we
obtained FDA approval of Alinity for blood and plasma screening and have made
significant progress obtaining regulatory approvals for a critical mass of our
immunoassay and clinical chemistry test menu.

I'll turn now to Nutrition where sales increased 6% in the
quarter, led by strong growth across several countries and segments of our
business, including Southeast Asia and Latin America, across both Pediatric and
Adult Nutrition as well as above-market growth in the U.S.

In Pediatric Nutrition, growth was driven by PediaSure, our
nutrition solution to help kids grow and thrive; and Pedialyte, our oral
rehydration product, which continues to see unprecedented uptake with both
children and adults.

In Adult Nutrition, global growth of 10% in the fourth
quarter was led by Ensure, our leading complete and balanced nutrition brand;
and Glucerna, our leading brand for people with diabetes.

Moving now to Medical Devices where sales increased nearly
11.5% in the fourth quarter led by double-digit growth in Structural Heart,
Diabetes Care, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure. In Structural Heart, sales
increased 17% in the fourth quarter. Over the last couple of years, our
portfolio and long-term growth opportunities in this area have strengthened
considerably. We've been building our position organically in this area for
quite some time when in 2017, the combination with St. Jude created what I'd now
consider a best-in-class Structural Heart portfolio.

MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally
invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation or leaky heart valve, is the
cornerstone of our portfolio with annual sales this past year of nearly $700
million, growing 30%. Last year, we obtained an important new indication in the
U.S. that significantly expands the number of people that can be treated with
MitraClip. And just last week, we announced that we're initiating a clinical
trial that offers the potential to expand the treatable patient population even
further.

Beyond MitraClip, several exciting technologies are expected
to emerge from our Structural Heart pipeline in 2020, including CE Mark
approvals for TriClip, a first-of-its-kind technology to repair leaky tricuspid
heart valves; and for Tendyne, which targets replacement of the mitral valve as
well as U.S. approval of Portico for transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Turning now to Diabetes Care where sales increased nearly
35% in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre, our revolutionary continuous glucose
monitoring system. Several years back, we saw an opportunity to approach
continuous glucose monitoring or CGM in a fundamentally different manner
compared to others in the space. We challenged ourselves to rethink existing
paradigms as we sought to develop a solution that would truly benefit the mass
population of people living with diabetes around the world. That aspiration
influenced every aspect of Libre: highly accurate, simple to use, particularly
affordable and easy for patients to access. The results of our unique approach
have been remarkable by any measure. Libre has quickly become the global
market-leading wearable CGM. Its user base has roughly doubled each year to its
current level of approximately 2 million users globally, including the highest
user base among CGMs in the U.S. Reimbursement coverage has ramped up quickly
around the world as payers increasingly recognize its highly differentiated
value proposition. And it's the only CGM that's widely available through the
pharmacy channel, which is a significant benefit for patients as it simplifies
the process of acquiring the product.

In 2019, Libre achieved full year sales approaching $2
billion, an increase of 70% versus the prior year. And importantly, as we plan
for the substantial growth opportunity to come, we significantly expanded our
manufacturing capacity to keep up with anticipated demand for this
life-changing technology.

Now I'll wrap up with Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD
where sales increased 10% in the quarter, led by growth across several
geographies in Latin America and Asia. For the full year, sales increased 7%
for the second year in a row as this business continues to execute its unique
branded generic strategy in emerging markets. These markets are growing
rapidly, their populations are aging, their middle classes are expanding, and
health care spending is increasing due to improving access to health care. Our
strategy to build significant presence and scale in these markets is unique and
continues to result in strong growth.

So in summary, this was another highly successful year with
strong performance across our businesses. We continue to strengthen our
leadership positions in some of the largest and fastest-growing areas in health
care, and we're entering 2020 with great momentum across our businesses and
targeting another year of strong organic sales growth and double-digit EPS
growth.

I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2019
results and 2020 outlook in more detail. Brian?

BRIAN B. YOOR, EXECUTIVE VP OF FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all
references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic
basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.

Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter
increased 8.5%. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on
fourth quarter sales. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted
gross margin ratio was 59.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.7% of
sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 28.3% of sales.

The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 12.8%, lower than
our previous full year guidance of around 14.5% due to continued implementation
of and adaptation to the U.S. tax reform regulations. Our fourth quarter tax
rate reflects the aggregate adjustment to achieve our full year revised
effective tax rate of 14%.

Turning to our outlook for the full year 2020. Today, we
issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $3.55 to $3.65. For the full
year, we forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%. And based on current rates,
we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 0.5% on our full
year reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59%
of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement
across our businesses, offset by the impacts of investments to support the
rapid market adoption of our Alinity diagnostic systems, investments in Libre
and MitraClip manufacturing capacity expansions and the impact of currency mix.

We forecast adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7%
of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. We forecast
net interest expense of around $515 million and nonoperating income of around
$200 million. Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of 13.5% to 14% for the
full year 2020.

Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We forecast
adjusted EPS of $0.69 to $0.71, which reflects double-digit growth. We forecast
organic sales growth of around 7% and, at current rates, would expect exchange
to have a negative impact of a little more than 1% on our first quarter
reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above
58.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales and
adjusted SG&A expense of around 32% of sales. Lastly, we forecast net
interest expense of around $130 million in the first quarter.

Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick
overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by
business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid- to high
single-digit growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In Nutrition,
we forecast growth of around 4% for the full year and growth of 3% to 4% for
the first quarter. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid- to high single-digit growth
for both the first quarter and full year. And in Medical Devices, we forecast
double-digit growth, similar to last year, for both the first quarter and full
year.

With that, we will now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question
comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFA MERRILL
LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Oh, great. So I guess first, Miles, congratulations
on such an incredible run of 20-plus years of value creation. Obviously, an
incredibly impressive track record. And in light of that, now the first
question, I'd love to ask both you and Robert to comment on a topic that I know
is on the minds of most investors from a big-picture perspective. And that is
the durability of the incredible 7% revenue growth outlook that you guys have
expressed for 2020 and beyond. And the main reason I want to ask that question
is that when you take a step back, there is no other company in med tech
modeling anything close to that kind of growth off of that large of a base
especially for multiple years. So Miles, for you, I guess just if you wouldn't
mind providing some big-picture thoughts on that durability topic. And then for
Robert, maybe getting a little bit more specific on the product areas that give
you the confidence long term and whether or not M&A or divestitures could
play a slightly bigger role going forward to help you maintain that level of
growth.

MILES D. WHITE: Bob, this is Miles. The temptation to sort
of say something that sticks my successor with just unbelievable goals for the
future, et cetera, is overwhelming, so I'm going to speak first. Seriously, we
have been building what we've got here for an extended period of time. It
didn't just happen. It's not based on a single driving product or driving
business. It's actually quite broad-based across all of our businesses. And
while a lot of people have commented to me or us that, "Gee, you've got
the law of big numbers and hard for a big company to grow, et cetera," we
don't actually feel like that big a company. And we don't necessarily feel,
even though we've got leading positions in so many of our businesses, we don't
actually feel like the law of big numbers is working against us. We feel like
the opportunity for growth, if you've got an innovative pipeline and you're in
markets where there's a natural tailwind of growth demographically or from an
innovation standpoint and so on, I don't really think that this whole notion
of, gee, our size or big numbers applies. If we were a tech company, you
wouldn't be asking us that because we'd be too small.

So I think if we look at the size of the opportunities,
where we've placed the company and its businesses and the portfolio of products
and geographies and so forth, I think there's enormous market opportunity
that's untapped. And I think there's enormous penetration to be tapped. And I
think there's some obvious examples out there. And fortunately, in all of our
businesses, I think every one of them is innovating and creating new products
and innovating to replace older products in a way that's really never been true
before. And it's across the board.

And so as we look forward at that and model it, we think our
growth rates are sustainable. How far out are they sustainable? I don't know,
but years anyway. And are we going to have speed bumps? We're going to have
speed bumps of our own making. We're going to have speed bumps from trade.
We're going to have speed bumps from exchange. We're going to have speed bumps
in any number of ways as all companies have and do. And yet we -- and we have
them now, and we're still growing at a very healthy, strong rate. And I credit
the innovation pipeline, some smart acquisitions at the right time with the
right businesses, the right strategies, the right fits. I credit the execution
of our organization and the culture of execution that is here.

I have super confidence in my successor, no qualms. The
minute you retire, everybody thinks you ought to diversify your holdings
because you're too concentrated in one thing. I only wish I had more. And I'll
remind him every day that I'm a shareholder, but -- which he knows. But I have
nothing but confidence in the pipeline, the management, the products, the
strategies and the new leader who's going to take over from me. I have
tremendous confidence in Robert, and he's got all the abilities, all the skills,
et cetera.

So we can keep talking about the law of big numbers, and
gee, how do you grow on this base? We don't feel slowed or anything by that. We
feel like we've got tremendous opportunity to sustain our growth rates.

ROBERT B. FORD, PRESIDENT, COO & DIRECTOR, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Yes. Bob, this is Robert here. As you're aware, under Miles'
leadership the last 20-plus years, Abbott's been reshaped several times. I was
close to him and to the Board when we went with this last reshaping of the
company to really position and align our businesses to kind of high-growth
markets, geographies, et cetera. And as Miles said, it wasn't just the
acquisition piece of it, which was important, but it was also how we looked at
our internal R&D, our internal innovation and how we thought about it. So
obviously, with the transition here as CEO, there's the natural question of the
incoming, do they think differently? Is there a change in strategy? Is it a
different way of thinking? And I can tell you, I'm very much aligned with
Miles. We see things very similar as it relates to our strategy, how we
operate, the philosophy of the company, the vision we have for Abbott. And in
the last 18 months, for me in particular, to be kind of close to Miles during
this transition period, being closer to him with his mentorship and learning
how he has been able to kind of create value, as you referenced in the
beginning there, that leaves me with my #1 priority to do that is to really
execute, as Miles said, on these organic growth opportunities we have.

And we have multiple growth drivers, as you know, Bob, that,
in my opinion, they're in their very early stages. Whether it's Libre, the
Alinity rollouts, our rejuvenated cardiovascular portfolio, I think we've got a
great opportunity in our adult international nutrition business; our branded
generic pharmaceutical business in the emerging markets, which is a very unique
strategy. So I look at all of that, and your question of how sustainable is
this? I think all these opportunities are in the early stages here. And it's
really going to be up to me and the team here to make sure that we maximize on
all of these opportunities. So we've got a portfolio that's aligned to the
biggest areas of medical need, attractive geographies. As Miles said about the
pipeline, it's a very rich pipeline. We talk about how this pipeline has
evolved and how we haven't seen as rich as a pipeline at Abbott in a long time.
And it's a nice cadence also. It's not just a kind of one and done. We've got
multiple kind of rollouts here.

Our -- the way we operate is very strong. Miles talked about
our culture. We set high aspirations for ourselves, and we do have a culture of
accountability of execution. And then you layer that in with 100,000 of
colleagues around the world that are passionate. They care about what they're
doing. They believe in what we're doing. They believe in our strategy. I think
we've got all the elements here to be able to sustain this kind of growth rate
going forward.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS: Great. That's super helpful. Just one
super short follow-up on diabetes. Robert, if you wouldn't mind, just give us a
quick update on Libre 2 time lines and your thoughts there. And then if you're
willing to give us a sense for, in your 2020 guidance, what sort of growth
assumption are you making for Libre in 2020?

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. So on Libre 2, specifically last
October, I mentioned that we were working through a handful of issues. Quite
frankly, we encountered these handful of issues in other parts of our businesses
too. So it's nothing that for us is terribly surprising. It's normal. I'm not
going to go into any of the real specifics here. But what I will say, Bob, is
that since that time in October, I'm very pleased with the progress that we've
made. And I continue to be very confident in Libre 2 and its performance and
the product itself and in its iCGM label.

So regarding the guidance on Libre 2, what I can tell you is
that we've got a lot of growth. We -- our guidance contemplates a lot of Libre
growth. So we're not necessarily differentiating here between 1 and 2. But if
you look at our Q4, we had a great Q4 with Libre, and that's without Libre 2 in
the U.S. It was a great way to exit and to enter 2020. As Miles said, we're the
market leader in CGM in revenue and in the amount of patients, and we're
growing at twice the rate.

Our strategy here has always been -- Miles talked about
challenging some of the paradigms. It has always been, from the moment we
launched, to look at this as a more kind of consumer retail, kind of Web shop
online play here. So when you look at our Q4, you don't see that kind of big Q4
spike and then drop in Q1, which you usually see from kind of medical benefit
DME products. Our growth is very kind of consistent and sequential.

The U.S. has done very well in the year. Obviously, we want
to do better, but we exited the year with well over 0.5 million patients in the
U.S. We set up some goals for 2019 as it relates to distribution, payer
coverage in the U.S., formulary positions. And we exited 2019 exactly where we
wanted to be with all of those goals all favorable to Libre.

So our focus in the U.S. in 2020 here is really to take
advantage of what we've established in terms of the infrastructure and drive
demand. So you'll see more TV advertising. You'll see more sales force
expansion. You'll see more partnerships and execution of those partnerships.
You'll see more sampling. And I think that, that same momentum that you see in
the U.S. is also there in our international markets, which is obviously a much
larger base for us, and we saw great momentum in Q4.

So our 2020 here is really focusing on international markets
is expanding Libre into geographies that we haven't yet launched. We were
capacity constrained in 2019, so there are several markets that we haven't
launched. And we've put in place now plans to roll Libre into those new
geographies and roll out Libre 2 into some of those Libre 1 markets.

One thing I think is important to kind of put front and
center here is the clinical aspect of Libre. It is the most studied CGM right
now. And if you look at the data, whether it's our data, whether it's
real-world evidence data, whether it's third-party government-sponsored trials,
they all say the same thing, which is people that use Libre have better
outcomes. They live better. Their A1c drops. Their hypo drops. Their rate of
hospitalization goes down. So the value proposition that we've always
envisioned for Libre, not only is it intact, but we actually see it growing.
It's an easy-to-use, intuitive, consumer-friendly product that delivers the
outcomes that are real and measurable, and it's priced for mass adoption. It's
affordable.

We always saw the therapy benefit not only for type 1s and
for pumpers. We saw this therapy benefit for people that were on one-shot-a-day
insulin, oral med patients. So we always looked at this market to be 80 million
to 100 million people. Now is it going to penetrate all 100 million people?
That might be a little bit too aspirational. But what I would say is that is it
more than 2 million, 3 million, 5 million, 10 million people? Absolutely. And
that's how we're building our strategy: investing in the product, investing in
awareness and investing in the scalability so we can capitalize on this
opportunity.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus
from JPMorgan.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO,
RESEARCH DIVISION: I'll echo Bob's sentiment. Miles, sorry to see you go, but
we're very happy to have someone so confident as Robert step in. Maybe if we
could turn to Structural Heart. I was wondering if you could give an update on
where we are with reimbursement and MitraClip. And then also, a bit more
broadly, Miles, you talked about some of the new product launches we're going
to see in 2020. Maybe you could just walk us through those and the expectations
throughout the year.

ROBERT B. FORD: So Robbie, I'll take that. On MitraClip,
listen, we had a great quarter, had a great year. And as Miles said in his
comments, about $700 million product growing at 30%. And the interesting thing
here is that the penetration of the therapy is only at about 5%, right? So we
see a long opportunity.

I talked about MitraClip being a multiyear,
multibillion-dollar opportunity here, and there's several elements to that. CMS
reimbursement is an important building block. We expect that sometime in Q2.
But I've always said that it was more than just the CMS reimbursement for the
indication expansion we got. We know that we need to be able to penetrate the
therapy. We need to open new centers, make it more available to do that. We
need to hire more reps, invest in field clinical teams to be able to get that
penetration. And we've also invested in a lot of clinical evidence and building
clinical evidence here. We just recently announced our study to investigate
MitraClip in moderate-risk surgical patients.

So again, we've been investing to build this market. And
obviously, MitraClip gets a lot of attention in the Structural Heart portfolio.
But if I take a step back here, I think it's important that we look at -- we've
always seen valvular heart disease as a big opportunity for Abbott, whether
it's the demographics, whether it's the medical need. And we saw this unique
opportunity with the St. Jude acquisition to put together our MitraClip
capabilities with the portfolio of St. Jude and really create a stand-alone
business unit that was best-in-class for Structural Heart, and we did that. And
it's been about 2 years that we've done that. And I think we're seeing really the
impact of the effect of a dedicated team, R&D, clinical.

And we've got a nice cadence of products coming out this
year as a result of that work. We've got 2 new CE approvals that we expect this
year. Miles mentioned them. TriClip, this is a modified version of our
MitraClip to treat the leaky heart valve. We believe it's a big opportunity
because therapy -- if mitral therapy is low, tricuspid leaky valve treatment or
repair is even lower. So we know that -- we know how to build this. We did it
with mitral, and we're going to go about doing it the same way, building the
capabilities, the clinical evidence.

Another big opportunity we have is with Tendyne. This will
be the first minimally invasive mitral replacement valve. So if you think about
our team right now, we've built a lot of competency on mitral repair. And now
we're going to put in the hands of this team not only the opportunity to offer
repair but also a replacement solution that's minimally invasive. And I think
there's a great opportunity for us in that space, too. Both those products are
enrolling here in the U.S., so we do plan to bring those to the U.S.

On the aortic side, we've made investments on Portico. We
knew that we needed to make some clinical and some R&D investments here to
increase the competitiveness of the system. And we like the data. We think
there's going to be a segment of the population, segment of the market that we
will be able to compete effectively. It's under FDA review, and we expect
approval shortly.

And then finally, on our structural interventions, this is a
part of the portfolio that doesn't get a lot of attention here, but it's about
1/4 of our Structural Heart business. It's growing double digit. We've got
great products there. We've seen a great ramp-up with our stroke prevention
technology with PFO, our congenital business; and Amulet, which is right now
under clinical evaluation in the U.S. for treatment of LAA.

So I take a step back here, I said, yes, MitraClip is a big
growth driver. We've got a lot of things going right there. We're making the
right investments from a clinical, from a commercial perspective. But I look at
the portfolio that's been built here, and I'm very excited. It's very complete.
It's very differentiated, and there's a nice cadence, Robbie, to the launches.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS: Great. Appreciate that. And maybe just
a quick follow-up. Alinity still hasn't really started to launch in the U.S.,
yet you put up 13% growth in core lab in the fourth quarter. How should we be
thinking about the impact in 2020 from Alinity both in the U.S. and outside the
U.S.?

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes. I think that we're going to continue to
see this kind of rollout of the Alinity platform. The challenge we had a little
bit in the U.S., and Miles talked about the progress we made, is that when we
launched it in Europe, we had a more complete kind of assay menu. And that
allowed us to more -- with more intentionality go after the market, the
existing accounts, new accounts. And in the U.S., we've now achieved, let's say,
a critical mass of assay menu, test panel, et cetera, that allows us to have
that same kind of intentionality we had in Europe, have that same
intentionality move into the U.S.

Q4, we did have some capital sales, so that brings up the
growth rate a little bit. But I think you're going to see the same kind of
growth rate in the U.S., the same kind of ramp-up that we saw in Europe.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from David Lewis from
Morgan Stanley.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: I
don't want to sound like a broken record, but I'll reiterate, Miles, there's
some fairly significant and unique value creation over these last 20 years, so
congratulations again on behalf of shareholders. Robert and Miles, just
starting off with a couple of businesses that has lagged in 2019 that are
actually showing some improvement here in the back half of '19, which were
neuromodulation and CRM, some pretty decent improvement specifically in the
fourth quarter. Wondering, Robert, if you can just talk through what specific
changes have been made in those 2 businesses and how you're thinking about the
outlook or sustainability of those franchises into 2020. And then I had a quick
follow-up.

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. So let's start a little bit with neuro
then. I mean I think we had a tough year, full year in neuro. When we came into
the year, we talked about some of the challenges we were up against, and there
are really 2 we had. Obviously, the sales force expansion and some of the
disruption that, that created, but we felt it was important to do to make that
sales force expansion. And then some of the market declines that we saw. We've
kind of seen double-digit growth in the beginning of the year, kind of saw that
go to flat and even negative growth rates.

So I think the sales force expansion piece, we kind of got
past that in the middle of the year. It's a unique selling model. About 30% to
35% of our sales team in the U.S. was new. It was under a year, so we spent a
lot of time getting them up to speed not only with their territories but how to
go about the selling process, et cetera. And I think that's largely behind us.

Now obviously, if you look at the sales reps, the ones that
have 7 to 10 years of experience, they're much more productive than the ones
that have got 12 months. But we're seeing a nice, steady ramp-up in terms of
the productivity of those new sales reps.

And the other thing we talked about was how innovation and
new product launches could kind of fuel the market growth. And I think you saw
that in Q4, not only with us but even with some of the other players in the
market come out with new product launches, at least what I've seen now from
some of the pre-announcements, having kind of an impact there. And so we came
out with our product launch, Proclaim XR, early in Q4. And I think you saw the
impact of that in Q4. I think it's a modest -- it was a modest improvement. We
expect more. And a lot of our focus here in 2020 is going to be to ensure that
this new sales team has got innovation to sell. So we're expanding our MRI
portfolio. We know we need to do. We're launching a new radiofrequency ablation
generator. This is an important part of our customers' practices, and we felt
that we weren't as competitive with our offering there. So we've developed a
new system that will be rolling out this year.

And we also believe that programming and connectivity,
connectivity to devices, consumer devices is an important aspect of patient
adoption of the therapy. So we'll continue to work on how we integrate the
implanted device into those more consumer products. And so we've got a nice
cadence of rollouts there.

And on the CRM side, we talked about this in the beginning
of last year, we had -- we encountered some challenges. And we felt that one of
the things that we needed to do for the CRM side was -- is to make sure it got
more focus and more attention, not only from me obviously but from the
management team. So we made an organizational structure change Q1 of last year,
which got finalized in Q2, where we separated the CRM business from the EP
business. And we didn't do it just from a field sales perspective. We did it
really across all functions. So we have a dedicated CRM business unit with a
dedicated leader, R&D, et cetera. And I think you've seen some of the
output of that focus in the second half of the year. I would like to see a
couple more quarters strung together. So that's what we're aspiring here to.

But I think one of the biggest impacts of that focus,
obviously the field has an impact, but I'm more excited about the focus on the
R&D side. I think we had kind of slowed down our R&D innovation over
here. And that focus, that dedicated business unit focus, I think you'll see
the output of that not only in 2020, we have a couple of product launches in
the U.S., a new ICD, and in Europe also, but we've got plans for a nice cadence
of innovation in '21 and '22.

So I'm excited about kind of what we've done there.
Obviously, it's early innings in terms of this business unit to be creating,
but I like what I see.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Okay. And just 2 quick follow-ups for me.
Just, Robert, on MitraClip, is there a specific embedded assumption in the
guidance for MitraClip? And how acutely do you think we see that recovery in
the back half? And then your margin guidance, about 50 basis points is a little
lower than 2019, consistent with our numbers. But if you could just highlight 2
or 3 of the examples of significant reinvestment for growth in 2020, that would
be super helpful.

ROBERT B. FORD: So I just -- on your question about
MitraClip, recovering growth, and I think we've been pretty strong in our
growth rate. The U.S. has done very well. And what we saw in the international
market, if that's what you're referring to, we did see that kind of impact of the
-- some of the studies that came out in Europe impact us in the first quarter.
But every quarter sequential to that, we've seen improvement, and I think we've
passed that on.

Regarding the guidance, I mean we've got a lot of growth, as
I said, with Libre. We've got a lot of growth here. We've contemplated, as I
said, CMS approval. But I have been fairly consistent with this: CMS approval
is going to be an important aspect here, but it's not just that, right? It's
the -- we've been showing really strong growth in the U.S. even without the
reimbursement. And that's a result of the investments that we've been making
both from a field and clinical perspective.

And I'm sorry, what was the other question?

BRIAN B. YOOR: It is on margin expansion. I'll start off by
saying just margin improvement is an ongoing focus for us, David, has been and
will continue to be, whether that's gross margin, whether that's the leverage
we continue to get in SG&A. And yes, notably, we did see that this year.
You may be off just a little bit from our model in the foreign currency mix. We
have a little bit of a headwind next year. But we have a gross margin expansion
plan underlying. But keep in mind, as Robert said, with these investments that
we're doing for growth, whether that's continued Libre expansion, whether it's
the most recent MitraClip expansion we announced as well as the unprecedented
uptake of Alinity, that's presenting a little bit of a headwind. But that's a
good news item in the short term. And longer term, you'll continue to see those
gross margins expand as we look out over the years.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from
Evercore.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR, MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL
EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on a really nice print here. One, maybe
on Nutrition, the adult side is coming really strong. I know China has been a
bit of a bother with some regulatory changes a couple of years ago. Could you
comment on what you're seeing in China? Is Adult Nutrition back? Has something
changed in China for you guys?

ROBERT B. FORD: Well, listen, we achieved a pretty strong
growth rate in Q4. And that's despite some of the softness that we did see in
China. We talked a little bit about it in Q3, Vijay. We've seen some
improvement, but some of those dynamics are still there, whether it's the birth
rate or some of the kind of competitive intensity. We have obviously developed
a plan here as we were going into Q4 and going into 2020 here. A big part of
that strategy to address some of those competitive dynamics there is innovation
and product launches. And we've put a plan together here. We've got a nice
steady steam -- stream of cadence of launches in China.

But I do think that it does point out to the strength of our
Nutrition business, that we're able to post this kind of growth rate despite
still some continued softness in China. And I think that speaks to the strength
of the business. Miles talked about we had some very strong growth in Southeast
Asia and Latin America on both sides of the business, Pediatric and Adult. And
I don't think that -- I think it shows this -- China is an important market for
us for sure. It has our intentions -- our attention, but we're not overly
reliant on it.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR: That's helpful, Robert. And one on
Diagnostics. I know flu has been the topic du jour. I'm just curious on what it
means for Diagnostics. On the core lab side, with Alinity, really strong
trends. You spoke about continued share gains in Europe. I'm just curious where
we are in -- on the U.S. side. Have you -- is the win rate on the U.S. side
comparable to Europe? Or is that something that we should be expecting for the
back half heading into 2021?

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes. As I said in Europe, I think we've had
kind of good success in Europe. We've talked about winning new businesses at
that 50% rate, the renewals of our existing business or retailing nearly all of
that business. And I think in the U.S. right now, it might be a little bit too
early just because you don't -- we really didn't have the intentionality of the
launch that we had in Europe. Now that we've got a more complete menu, I think
our ability to compete and our competitive fitness, let's call it that way, in
the U.S. increases to the same level that we've had in Europe.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen
from Wells Fargo.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO
SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on another really strong quarter,
and Miles, I'll echo what the other -- the other comment and add that I'll miss
interacting with you on these calls. Always insightful and fun. Just 2 quick
questions. One, maybe for Robert, on capital allocation. I know I've asked this
on a few calls before, but you guys have paid down a lot of debt recently. Are
you, Robert, maybe thinking about M&A a little bit differently? Should we
expect more tuck-ins in 2020? And I just had one quick follow-up.

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. I think what you'll see is the same
philosophy, the same framework that we've had for all these years, which is a
very kind of balanced approach. As you've said, a lot of our focus the last
couple of years has been to pay down debt. We paid down close to $10 billion
over the last 2 years. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is around 1.5 now. And we've
got kind of payments that are due in the next few years, and that's all kind of
contemplated in our capital plan.

The other thing we're always going to have a mindful eye
here, Larry, is ensuring that a portion of that capital goes back to our
shareholders. Our dividend is a big part of our identity. We've increased our
dividend for 47 consecutive years. This year, we just announced a 13% increase.
So -- and we announced also at the end of last year a share repurchase of about
$3 billion. We do that from time to time mainly to kind of offset dilution.
We'll also look at our growth opportunities, and we've talked a lot about them,
whether it's the rollout of Alinity, whether it's the manufacturing expansion
of Libre. We just announced in Q4 a new manufacturing site, a second
manufacturing site for MitraClip. Those are all great returns for our
shareholders in terms of the return of that capital.

And then on the M&A side, we're not looking to do any
deals right now. I think the framework that Miles has always worked, it's true
to me, which is it needs to meet our threshold of it being strategic or -- and
at the same time, opportunistic. And we've been looking at it a lot. We're
always studying. We're always looking. And I haven't seen anything crossing the
radar here that kind of falls into those 2 buckets. But we're always going to
keep looking as we've always done.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN: Perfect. And then just one
housekeeping. For Brian, and Brian, congratulations on your retirement, and
I'll miss you as well. Just FX on EPS impact in 2020.

BRIAN B. YOOR: The impact of what?

ROBERT B. FORD: EPS FX.

BRIAN B. YOOR: Oh, FX. It's around $0.05, Larry.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Rick Wise from
Stifel.

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE, MD & SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH
ANALYST, STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe
I'll start off with EPD. EPD, Robert, is always a little bit of a black box to
us medical device analysts or I'll just say to me. I won't drag everybody else
into it. Currently doing exceptionally well, strong fourth quarter, and you're
saying mid- to high single digits for 2020. But maybe just give us a little
update on some of the key drivers. What could get you to the upper end of your
range? And maybe some of the challenges, just give us some perspective about
what you're thinking about for 2020.

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. I've heard this comment a couple of
times now about kind of EPD or pharma business kind of being a black box or not
as transparent and as -- not as understanding. I mean I will say here the
biggest focus of this business is taking opportunity of the geographic
dynamics, right? You can either have a proprietary pharmaceutical business, a
little bit more higher cost versus a pure generic business, which is obviously
very, very cheap. Our branded generic business kind of sits between those 2
bookends.

I come from an emerging market, so I can tell you that when
we buy medications, it's not reimbursed. So you pay for it out of pocket. And
you're willing to pay a little bit of a premium to ensure that what you're
getting is high-quality product. And I think that that's what this business has
been built on, is taking advantage of that dynamic of this population in these
markets, growing with their disposable income and allocating some of that to
their health care costs on brands that they trust. And that's what we've been
building over these years.

A key driver of this strategy here is you need to be -- you
need to have the breadth and the depth in your therapy classes. So we have
comprehensive portfolios in the geographies that we're competing. They're deep
in each therapy class. You need to be omnichannel. You need to be present in
the doctor's office. You need to be present in the pharmacy. You need to be
able to kind of communicate directly with the consumer. And you need to be
local. You need to have a local R&D engine, organization and manufacturing
to be able to move fast with the opportunities that you see. And I think that's
at the core of our strategy.

One of the challenges in this business, as Miles has always
said, is the FX piece of it. But the performance growth, we expect it to be in
this kind of high single-digit growth. And a big driver of that is being in the
right markets with the right infrastructure with the right products with the
depth and the focus on execution.

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE: Great. And turning to 2 other areas.
Heart Failure business has done a great job. How sustainable is the robust
growth we've seen? And maybe talk a little bit about the implications of the
less invasive surgical approach for HeartMate 3, what that might mean.

And just last, maybe touch a little bit on Alere. It's been
a little bit of a disappointment. What are the next steps? Help us understand
what's going on and where we go from here with Alere.

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. On Heart Failure, I mean we had a very
successful 2019. We achieved the destination therapy indication for HeartMate 3
at the end of '18, so that rolled into '19. So you saw the growth rate of about
20% here, Rick. That growth is predominantly driven by share gains and
specifically here in the U.S. So we exited 2019, our estimation right now is,
through our internal data, north of 80%. So as we go into 2020, we expect that
to not be at that 20% rate now and to mirror more of what the market is
growing, which is we expect to be in that mid-single-digit range. But I do
believe that we've got a lot of opportunity.

I talked about cadence of innovation in our products, and
one product that's come pretty quiet, but we've done a really good job there is
CardioMEMS. CardioMEMS is now close to $100 million. It's growing 30%. We
continue to enroll in our GUIDE-HF trial that's going to be used to open an
NCD. But the outcomes there are also extremely meaningful in terms of hospitalization
reductions, et cetera. So I think that'll be kind of our next driver of growth
in Heart Failure, and I'm very pleased with what the team has been able to
build in that business.

Going to your question on Alere, it's been a little bit of a
-- we'll call it like a mixed bag here. We've had some businesses that we
brought into Abbott, and I think we've done very well with them. We've
accelerated their performance. If I look at the infectious disease portfolio in
our developed markets, that's done very well. Yes, of course, there's some
opportunity there with the flu season. But I think the team has done a really
good job here expanding the portfolio and looking at those -- that installed
base beyond just a flu test. And our cardiometabolics business has done very
well too, growing in the high single digits, low double digits. So I think
those 2 businesses, we've done a really good job with. And I think the team has
done a good job on the cost side with the synergies, too.

But you have pointed out that there are some parts in the
business here where we're not pleased with, we're not satisfied. Our emerging
markets infectious disease segment had a tough 2019. Part of that is kind of
NGO purchasing cycles and dynamics in certain markets. But we've got to do
better than that. And we've implemented a strategy here to really look at other
emerging markets outside of the African continent here and build the value
proposition of those tests in other emerging markets.

In our toxicology business too, I don't think we've been
able to kind of fully maximize the value there. And that one there has got a
lot of attention, too. So we had a good Q4, a lot of focus here, a lot of good
growth in the U.S. I think part of that was a little bit of the flu. But if we
can get these 2 business here, our emerging markets and our toxicology
business, to execute on the plans that we've put in place for them, I think
you'll see that as kind of a mid-growth -- mid-single-digit kind of growth
business for us.

But I look at the trend and the dynamics of these products,
the opportunities we have, the strategy to get into these businesses is still
very much intact also. Miles talked about more and more testing move into
alternative channels. We continue to see that. And we're targeting steady
improvement here. But I think the long-term growth opportunity because of that
trend is very positive.

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE: Congratulations.

OPERATOR: And our final question comes from Kristen Stewart
from Barclays.

KRISTEN MARIE STEWART, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations, Miles, on your retirement, and Brian, I
hope your next chapter is a positive one as well. Just I guess a couple of
cleanup questions. In terms of the, I guess, PHP product, I was just wondering
if you can maybe update us on just the time lines there for expected launch.
And then also for Amulet as well, just kind of expectations for launch, just to
get some time lines. And then also, I think you, Robert, had also mentioned
just some products within the CRM business launching there. Could you just
maybe update us on expectations for that franchise? I think you mentioned a new
ICD platform and some other milestones you expect within the CRM portfolio.

ROBERT B. FORD: So sure. On PHP and Amulet, I mean those are
still, let's say, a couple of years away. So we're still in kind of clinical
evaluation of that. We'll then kind of put the information together, submit to
the FDA. So I'd say your kind of normal time lines over there. So you can look
at it about a couple of years away.

On the CRM side, like I said, I think the biggest
opportunity we had when we changed the structure was to kind of get the
innovation going. So we've got 2 product launches. We've got a new version of
-- a new update to our implantable cardiac monitor planned for this year. We've
got a new ICD planned again for both U.S. and Europe. And our growth
expectations here are to be -- to do better than what we've been doing, steady
sequential improvement. We've had some challenges. And I think that these
products here will allow us to continue that sequential improvement here. So
I'll...

KRISTEN MARIE STEWART: And then I'm sorry, go ahead.

ROBERT B. FORD: Go ahead.

KRISTEN MARIE STEWART: I was just going to say, and do you
see any opportunities -- I think Bob had mentioned this, but any opportunities
just in terms of divestitures within Medical Devices or elsewhere within the
portfolio or some smaller tuck-in? I know you said -- didn't sound like you
were going to do any larger-scale M&A, but just more product lines to bring
into the portfolio from a more of a tuck-in acquisition from technology,
earlier stage.

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes. Listen, if I take that and just talk
about our model, we have a diversified model. I fundamentally believe in our
diversified model. I think you've seen sequential improvement in all 4 areas
over the last couple of years from a big-picture perspective. Now when you go
into each one of them, can you find some areas that we can do better and we
should do better? Yes, we can, and we've talked about some of those today. But
that doesn't mean that we don't think there are great opportunities. That just
means that we need to focus on doing better and executing better on that. So as
I look at these 4 businesses, I like the businesses we have.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. This is Miles again. I'll wrap up and
close for us.

So first of all, thank you all very much for your very kind
comments. And on behalf of both Brian and I, well, I'll speak and tell you that
it's been a great honor and a great pleasure for us to lead our company. It's
been a tremendous experience. I feel like I've had 2 or 3 careers here in the
last 21 years and probably have.

Brian was estimating this morning, this was our 85th or 86th
earnings call. And therefore, I can't tell you that I know yet whether I'm
going to miss them, but I sure have a lot of them. And they're always
challenging. They're always interesting opportunities to converse with you
about the prospects of the company and so forth.

I feel like I'll leave the company in perhaps its best
position ever in terms of products and growth, future opportunities, et cetera.
As I said at the beginning, I'm very pleased with the succession and the
management team that's here. It's not just the CEO that's changing. The CFO is
changing, and Bob Funck, who's a longtime Abbott employee and he's been our
controller for a number of years and been in some of the most challenging jobs
at Abbott and so forth, will be an absolutely superb successor to Brian. You know
that a lot of our management team has changed over the last couple of years as
we move to a next generation of leaders and managers in the company. And I
think it's a great mix of people that are homegrown and also have come to us
either through St. Jude or other outside places. And we're just really happy
with the team we've got, the pipelines we've got, the positions we've got. We
think our success is sustainable. And I think the track record that we've laid
down over the last years has been recognized that way, and we're appreciative
of the recognition that all of you have given it.

As I commented tongue-in-cheek, as a significant shareholder
of the company, I'll obviously be watching closely and especially in the
immediate future as the Chairman.

So with that, we'll close the call. Thank you all very much,
and thanks for all your support.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER: Very good. Thank you, operator,
and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference
call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central
Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank
you for joining us today.

in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning, and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions)

This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of
any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the
entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed
written permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Ford, President and
Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and
Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian will
discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments,
we'll take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological
and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in items
1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Abbott undertakes no obligation to
release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of
subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.

Please note that financial results and guidance provided on
the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for
continuing operations only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless
otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth,
which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES D. WHITE, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD & CEO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported results of
another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.84, reflecting 12%
growth on an absolute basis and even higher growth when excluding the impact of
currency.

Sales increased more than 7.5% on an organic basis in the
quarter led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices and sequential
improvements in Established Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. We also narrowed
off our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $3.23 to $3.25,
which, at current rates, would reflect high-teens growth, excluding the impact
of currency and is at the upper end of the range we set at the beginning of the
year.

As we've discussed previously, following our recent
strategic shaping and acquisitions, we've been completely focused on running
the company we built. This focus on organic execution is delivering strong
performance on a remarkably consistent basis. Over the last 8 quarters, we've
averaged 7.5% organic sales growth worldwide with very little variation. We've
also continued to strengthen our portfolio with new products, expanded access
on reimbursement coverage and generated new clinical data that further enhances
the sustainability of our strong growth outlook going forward.

I'm particularly pleased with the continued exceptional
performance across several of our key growth platforms, including FreeStyle
Libre, MitraClip and Alinity, which I'll highlight as I summarize our third
quarter results in more detail.

And I'll start in our Medical Devices business where sales
increased double digits for the second quarter in a row. In Structural Heart,
we achieved 16% sales growth led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for
the treatment of mitral regurgitation or leaking heart valve. MitraClip sales
increased more than 30% in the quarter, including U.S. growth of nearly 50%.
During the quarter, we received U.S. FDA approval for our next-generation
MitraClip device, and we initiated the first-ever U.S. pivotal trial for the
minimally invasive treatment of tricuspid regurgitation, which will evaluate
the safety and efficacy of our TriClip repair system.

Turning now to FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading
continuous glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine
fingersticks. We achieved sales of $0.5 billion in the quarter and continued to
add significantly to our global user base, as reflected by organic sales growth
of nearly 70%. During the quarter, FreeStyle Libre obtained public
reimbursement coverage in Ontario and Quebec, becoming the first and only
sensor-based glucose monitoring system to be listed by any provincial health
plan in Canada.

We also continued to advance our strategy to develop
integrated solutions where people with diabetes can seamlessly manage their
condition across devices, including recent announcements that we're seeking to
integrate Libre with the insulin delivery technologies of Sanofi and Tandem as
well as the digital care platform of Omada Health. This easy-to-use, affordable
device is changing the way millions of people manage their diabetes. And our
ongoing efforts to expand awareness, adoption and access for Libre around the
world will drive tremendous growth for years to come.

Turning now to Diagnostics where sales grew 6.5% in the
quarter led by double-digit growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics. The rollout
of Alinity in Europe and other international markets continues to drive strong
growth in our Core Laboratory business outside the U.S. In the U.S. where we
continue to outperform the market with our legacy ARCHITECT system, we've made
good progress achieving regulatory approvals of immunoassay and clinical
chemistry test for Alinity and are beginning to ramp up our launch efforts in
these areas. With highly differentiated instruments and a matrix rollout across
multiple geographies and diagnostic testing areas over time, Alinity is well
positioned to be a multiyear growth platform for our Diagnostics business.

In Nutrition, sales increased nearly 4% in the quarter led
by double-digit growth in international Adult Nutrition for the third quarter
in a row. In Pediatric Nutrition, above-market growth in the U.S. and several
other countries was partially offset by challenging market dynamics in Greater
China, which comprises a little less than 10% of our overall nutrition sales.
While consumers continue to trade up for premium brands, which is the segment
where we compete, we've seen volume in the market decline due to historically
low birth rates. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and
competitiveness across the various segments and purchasing channels in China
and given our broad portfolio and global footprint, anticipate continued strong
performance across other geographies and long-term growth opportunities such as
Adult Nutrition.

I'll wrap up with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where
sales increased 8% in the quarter led by strong growth in several geographies
including India, China and Brazil. Sales growth in EPD has now improved
sequentially for each of the last 3 quarters. With leading market positions in
several international growth geographies, EPD is well positioned for sustained
above-market growth in some of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical
markets in the world.

So in summary, we're performing extremely well across
several areas of the portfolio, resulting in another quarter of strong sales
and earnings growth. We continue to strengthen our product portfolios and key
product platforms with a steady cadence of new product approvals, reimbursement
coverage and clinical data. And we're well on track to deliver ongoing EPS and
organic sales growth at the upper ends of the ranges we set at the beginning of
the year.

I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results
and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?

BRIAN B. YOOR, EXECUTIVE VP OF FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Okay. Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that
all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic
basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.

Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter
increased 7.6% on an organic basis. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar
strengthen modestly, resulting in an unfavorable impact on sales of 1.9% from
exchange or 50 basis points higher than if rates held steady since the time of
our call in July. Reported sales increased 5.5% in the quarter.

Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross
margin ratio was 59.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales
and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.1% of sales.

Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast
adjusted EPS of $0.94 to $0.96, which reflects nearly 17.5% growth at the
midpoint. We forecast organic sales growth of around 8% and at current rates,
would expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat above 1.5% on
fourth quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of
approximately 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7% of sales
and adjusted SG&A expense approaching 27.5% of sales.

Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a
quick overview of our fourth quarter organic sales growth outlook by business.
For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit growth. In
Nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single-digit growth. In Diagnostics, we
forecast mid- to high single-digit growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast
growth similar to the third quarter, which reflects continued double-digit
growth in several areas of this business.

With that, we will now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question
comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Just a couple of questions for me. Miles, just want to start off on growth. So
I mean this time of year, investors are very focused on sustainability. And you
obviously said you've been averaging 7.5% for 7 to 8 quarters. So a couple of
questions. One, your guidance for the fourth quarter implies a little bit of momentum
deceleration in the business. Anything specific to call out there? And then
more specifically, as you think about 2020, what are those drivers that get you
confident that you can deliver your growth in that 7%, 7.5% range that you've
been doing the last couple of years? And then one quick follow-up.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay, David. Well, I'll start with what you
said. We have had 8 straight quarters averaging 7.5%. Going into the fourth
quarter, we actually are going to be close to 8%. And then going into next
year, I think where we are in the range we've given, I think we gave a range at
the beginning of this last quarter of 7% to 8%, somewhere in that range. And
frankly, I've seen no change to that. I don't see any change to momentum at all
here. If anything, we've got pretty strong momentum across the board. We've got
sequential growth in a number of areas that we've expected improvement in, and
we're seeing that. EPD comes to mind.

Obviously, our growth drivers, Libre and MitraClip and the
Alinity systems, et cetera, are all very strong, Structural Heart is very
strong. So as I've said in the past many times, this is sustainable and strong
going forward. I see no change to momentum, no change to progress, no change to
growth rates. If anything, it gets better. So -- and it clearly will in the
fourth quarter.

So it's pretty strong, and the earnings flows with it. And
we're not going to make any guidance forecast or anything, but I think
directionally here, all fundamentals are strong for us.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Okay. Very helpful. And just one quick
product question, Miles. There's been -- Libre 2, obviously, an important
driver for next year. I just want to get your commentary. The longer this
product has not been approved, it's led to a kind of concern about the product,
the regulatory time line. Your view, your Tandem partnership yesterday suggests
to us that you're still confident in Libre 2 iCGM. Are you still confident in
Libre 2 iCGM? And how are you thinking about the timing potential for that
product?

MILES D. WHITE: I'd say I'm going to comment myself and then
I'm going to hand it to Robert Ford here to comment as well. But first, are we
confident? Absolutely. The product is performing wonderfully. The growth is
strong. The expansion is strong. There's a lot to be pretty encouraged about.
And while I recognize a lot of people, including us, are feeling impatience,
impatience doesn't translate to concern. We're all inpatient and we'd all like
everything yesterday. But it's not quite working out as yesterday. And Robert
can comment on that here, but there is nothing but good here looking forward
with Libre. And we anticipate a lot of expansion with this product, including
with some of these partnerships that we've announced and working with the
interoperability with various partners for what I think will be the future of
glucose monitoring and diabetes management. I think all of this is not just on
plan, but spectacular, particularly for diabetes patients. And I have nothing
but confidence in it. So let me turn over to Robert to expand on that a little
bit.

ROBERT B. FORD, PRESIDENT & COO, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Sure. Yes, David. Listen, admittedly, it's taking longer than we had expected.
We obviously misjudged that. We're currently working through a handful of open
items with the agency. And what I can tell you, I'm -- I've got the same
confidence level that Miles does. I'm confident in the data. I'm confident in
the product, right? In the meantime, if you look at Libre in Q3, we had an
exceptional Q3. Sales of just under $0.5 billion, that puts us on a $2 billion
run rate here with growth rate over 70%. Our international business grew 50%,
and that's on a large base. And then the U.S. sales nearly tripled. So -- and
it's tripled because we're adding new patients at a strong and steady rate. And
it's a high rate. And you could see that progression in our total Rxs. So --
and one of the challenges we've had over, like, the 9 months here has really
been about how to pulse our demand generation activities with aligning to our
supply, and we talked a little bit about kind of some of those supply
constraints.

So we've now released in the third quarter, towards the end
of the third quarter, our next tranche of manufacturing capacity on plan, on
schedule. And I can tell you, the commercial team right now is really feeling
excited about not being able to have that constraint over and really start to
intensify the commercial promotional efforts, whether that's advertising,
whether that's sampling, et cetera, both in the U.S. and international. I think
that gives us a lot of excitement as we exit the year going into next year.

The value proposition still continues to be very strong to
patients and physicians and to payers. And as Miles mentioned in his opening
comments, we achieved reimbursement in Canada, public reimbursement, the only
sensor system reimbursed in Canada. And it's important because it's one of the
top 5 largest glucose monitoring markets in the world. And similar to what we
saw in some of these large markets when we obtained national reimbursement, we
see a pretty accelerated kind of explosive growth. We saw that in Germany, we
saw that in France and U.K. So we expect to see that same trajectory in Canada.
And early indications suggest that kind of same curve. So that'll be also
exciting for the team as we move into Q4.

And as Miles also said, we're pleased with the partnership
strategy that we've adopted. We've gone through it at a very intentional phased
approach first with Bigfoot, as you know. We then moved into announcing our
agreements with insulin manufacturers, like Novo and Sanofi, that connect Libre
to their pen systems. And the next phase here, we'll start to move into insulin
pumps, and that was the agreement that we announced yesterday with Tandem to
codevelop an integrated system because we know this is an important segment
also connecting to pumps. And we're now at a phase where we feel we can start
to kind of roll that out as we've thought about our partnership strategy. So I
think momentum here on Libre is exceptional. It is very strong. As we go into
Q4, I think we've got a lot of stuff going right, firing all cylinders, whether
it's commercial, whether it's operation, whether it's our R&D program. So
I'm very confident on the sustainability of Libre and Libre going forward.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from
Wells Fargo.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO
SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So 2 for me, 1 on capital allocation, 1 on
MitraClip. Let me start, Miles, with capital allocation. Now that you have more
financial flexibility, how are you thinking about capital allocation and the
importance of reloading the pipeline? I think on the Q2 call, you seem to
deprioritize buybacks. But yesterday, you announced a $3 billion share
repurchase authorization. So has your view changed? And I just have one
follow-up on MitraClip.

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I'd say -- look, we've come through a
period where we've paid down a lot of debt, and I think we find ourselves in a
good capital balance. I think we're -- we've gotten to the place where our net
debt to EBITDA ratio is well ahead of what we targeted probably a year earlier
than we expected and that's with an aggressive pay down strategy, et cetera.
Our business is performing strong. Our cash flows are strong. Can we still
continue to pay down debt? We can. Can we refinance debt? We can. Can we do
things that are prudent, good balance sheet management? Yes. And we're also
generating cash. We are generating sufficient cash, more than sufficient cash,
to invest in a lot of manufacturing expansion for all the new products we've
talked about. Robert just mentioned one of the biggest, and that's fully funded
and obviously coming online and good.

So you say, all right, well, then how about the dividend?
Well, we raised the dividend 14% last December. And we have a targeted range
where we like to keep that dividend as a percent of our EPS, et cetera. So as
we go across all the things you can do with your cash, returning cash to
shareholders is also a positive thing to do if the conditions are right and if
the return is good, et cetera. And we want to be prepared to have that
flexibility on the table as well. We have not done significant share
repurchase, as you know, for several years while we focused on the pay down of
debt. But now we wanted to add back the flexibility to do that as well.

So I'd say, in general, we find ourselves in a strong cash
position, strong performance position, good strong balance sheet position. We can
continue to pay down some debt, but we've got the flexibility to do just about
whatever makes sense for us on a return basis or return to shareholder basis.
We don't have any active M&A on the radar screen to the extent that we
track or follow anything. I'd say it's your typical bolt-ons and tuck-ins and
so forth that are additions to already strong businesses. We're pretty happy
with our pipeline. We're pretty happy with our R&D pipeline. So our
standards are pretty high right now about what's attractive and what may not
be. But I'm not forecasting anything significant at all in the M&A area. So
obviously, we want to keep our options open here with how we manage cash for
our shareholder.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN: Very helpful. And then on MitraClip,
you have -- U.S. reimbursement goes up in October. You hopefully will have
coverage for the functional MR indication next spring. So you're thinking about
2020 as an inflection year for MitraClip. And in Europe, it looks like sales
improved, growth improved this quarter. How are you feeling about MitraClip
outside the U.S.?

MILES D. WHITE: Larry, I'm going to toss that one to Rob
Ford.

ROBERT B. FORD: Larry, thanks for the question. So we filed
our MitraClip NCD. It was kind of opened in August. That time line there is --
usually takes about 9 months. I mean that's the statutory maximum, as we'll
say. When we did FMR in MitraClip, that took about 7 months. So I think we'll
be in the December-January time frame kind of get exactly what quarter that's
going to land in. But in the meantime, you see kind of our growth rate. The
reimbursement is going to be important, but Structural Heart was up mid-teens
and the big driver of that was MitraClip, up 30%, up 50% in the U.S. So
reimbursement is going to be important. There will definitely be an inflection
point when we get it. But as I said in the previous call, that is a component.
It's a building block here that we're focusing on.

So opening new centers is another kind of key building
block. We have about 400 today, and I do want to get to about 550 over time.
And we've been supporting that with investments, investments in our sales
force, our clinical specialists, our therapy development specialists, so that
we can not only train the centers, train the implanters to keep up with that
demand that we see, but also to support the demand generation through the
development of this patient referral network. So that investment is ongoing, on
target, on plan in terms of how we're ramping up the field team. And as Miles
said in his opening comments, we continue to invest also in the innovation
side, on the product development side. So in July, we obtained approval for our
fourth-generation MitraClip, which has independent graspers, more sizes, et
cetera, that basically give more options to the position. And so I think that
MitraClip here is in its really early innings, although I think this is a
multiyear, multibillion-dollar growth opportunity that we've got. And it is
going to continue to ramp over time, and we're making the investments to make
sure we're going to lead in that. So as I look into 2020, I think we've got the
right momentum. And once we have NCD coverage, yes, I think there'll be an
inflection to growth.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank
of America.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFA MERRILL
LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just 2 quick product related questions. First, a
follow-up on the Libre 2 commentary. Just to kind of set expectations, just
curious, has there been any new data request from the agency? And is approval
of Libre 2 in the U.S. you think possible in the next couple months? Or could
it take a little longer?

MILES D. WHITE: Listen, we've -- what I'll say is that,
probably, we've obviously misjudged that. So I'm not going to sit here and try
and pinpoint the exact time line of the approval. As I said also, we've
actively been working through a handful of open items with the agency. And
that's where we're at.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS: Okay. Fair enough. And then I'd also
want to ask on Pediatric Nutritionals in China. And it's -- just curious if you
could elaborate a little bit more on the slowdown there. And then just
wondering if you could comment on China more broadly and your confidence in
growth continuing in China. So just comment on Pediatric Nutritionals in China,
please.

ROBERT B. FORD: Sure. Let me start off then with the
nutritional question here then. So you saw our Nutrition business was just
under 4%. We had really good growth in the U.S. in pediatrics up 4%, double-digit
growth in international adult for the second quarter in a row. So our challenge
here really was the international pediatric performance. This was really driven
by Greater China. And I would say there were some challenging market dynamics
here. As Miles mentioned, we're seeing the consumer trade up into the premium
brand segment, but the volume has been declining partly because of this low
birth rate. So this has led to, what I would say, a much more competitive
environment, competitive in terms of pricing, competitive in terms of
promotional activities. And this has now got our full attention, full attention
from the management team here. And our key thing is really focusing. And the
market dynamics are the market dynamics, but we've got to really focus on
improving our competitive fitness, our competitive position here in the
pediatric segment. We're launching a series of new strategies here in the
coming weeks regarding our media campaigns, strengthening our consumer
relationship platforms. We've got some plans to launch some new products over
the next several quarters. So I'd say that the key focus of us right now in
nutrition really has been, at this point here, to focus on improving our
competitive fitness in China.

MILES D. WHITE: And I'll follow up on the rest of the other
businesses in China. I'll give you a little bit of context. I think I'll speak
as a CEO. We, the multinational CEOs of the world, or we -- if we do business
in China, are we nervous about trade? Are we nervous about China? Are we
nervous about all this? I think you can't help but be nervous about it. But
I'll tell you what's interesting. While it's affecting some segments of the
U.S. economy and U.S. businesses pretty directly, it doesn't seem to be
affecting us or our business. The nutrition challenge we have is completely
separate from any kind of trade or economic or economy issues other than birth
rates. And the performance in our Device businesses, our Diagnostics businesses
and so forth are double digits and strong. There's all kinds of ways that
people can hypothesize that maybe the Chinese government would intervene and
make things more difficult and so forth for U.S. multinationals. But in our
business, we actually don't see that. And the product approvals are coming in a
timely manner. The China FDA is doing everything that they're supposed to do
and -- for our products. We haven't seen any of that kind of friction at all.
And the demand for our products and the performance of our businesses in China
has been strong. Other than the challenge we've got with Pediatric Nutrition,
all other businesses are doing well, show no signs of any kinds of issues. So
while I know that there are industries and segments that are tied to whether
it's automobiles, oil, big industries, et cetera, that may have challenges,
particularly agriculture, we're not seeing that. And our China business is
good.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from
Evercore ISI.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR, MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL
EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two for me. Maybe Miles, starting off with that
last question on the macro of China. I know there are number of moving parts,
China, 4X7 on the drug side. Some questions around maybe CapEx slowdown,
Diagnostics slowdown. Just to be clear, what is your exposure either on the
drug or diagnostics side to China? And maybe broadly comment on emerging
markets in general. It looks like some of those markets are slowing down. And
how is Abbott positioned to handle some of the macro slowdown, if you will?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, we're just going to try to figure out
who answers what part of that question. I'd say this. Underlying growth in
emerging markets is still good. Has it slowed some? Yes, it has slowed some,
but it's still good. It's a relative thing. So the underlying growth we see in
India, Latin America, China, et cetera, it's all good. You can say there's the
occasional Argentina. Okay, that's not good. Argentina is its own thing. But
there are -- the advancement of health care systems, the advancement in demand
for health products, pharmaceuticals, et cetera, strong. China, in particular,
for us for our pharmaceutical business, strong. We're doing well. I don't think
we have a lot of exposure. I'll let Robert expand on that in a minute. But
overall, I think the conditions for us on those markets remain strong. As we've
said many, many times, single most difficult thing we deal with is the volatile
currency, if it's volatile. And sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. And right
now, currency isn't exactly working on our favor in those markets. So while we
grow at a pretty healthy rate on an underlying basis and typically faster than
the market, currency erases some of that. Robert?

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes. I'll just -- Vijay, on the generic
pharma in China, I think you're referring to the 4+7 tendering process there.
We haven't seen an impact, and we don't anticipate a significant impact going
forward. We have a fairly kind of concentrated portfolio here of products, just
about 15 products here. Most of these products are more specialized kind of
segments and areas where there's it's kind of difficult to manufacture. So on
the generic side of the pharma business, we're less susceptible to this.
Obviously, we're going to monitor. We're part of this process. We understand
how the tendering process is going to work. But if I think about kind of bigger
impact, we have less of an impact here given the portfolio of products we have
in China.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR: That's helpful, guys. And just one
quick one on guidance maybe for Brian. Brian, looks like the Q4 guidance is
implying really strong margin expansion, 200 basis points plus. Just given some
of the comments on FX, maybe clarify the FX hit to Q4 on the margin side. And
in general, when you look at 2020, what kind of headwinds are we looking at
from an FX perspective?

BRIAN B. YOOR: Yes. From a top line next year, I'm not
prepared to talk about next year. But I think there would be naturally some
flow through on the top line next year, Vijay. Perhaps Scott can get back to
you on that, but let me circle back. If you look at Q3, you saw we had gross
margins of 59.2%. You were absolutely correct. Foreign exchange had an impact
on us of about 50 basis points. Otherwise, it would be at 59.7%. So I feel good
about where we're guiding Q4. Q4 tends to be that quarter where we get a little
bit more natural leverage as well. And you'll see that play out through the
bottom line. Pretty consistent with how we thought about this at the beginning
of the year. As you know, I mean, gross margin improvement is just part of our
DNA. It's part of what we do and how we think about in addition to cash flow
and is something we're going to continue to improve upon across all of our
businesses. And I think you could expect that to continue in the next year.
That's how we get to double-digit growth that we usually start with and
continue to invest back into our SG&A and R&D for our growth.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from
JPMorgan.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Miles, I was hoping you could touch on the Diagnostics
business. This is one you've called out for many quarters now as a durable,
multiyear growth driver for the company. We saw fantastic growth in Core Lab
this quarter, even without really benefit from Alinity hitting U.S. Maybe you
could just update us on the status of where you are in Europe in terms of the
rollout, what you're seeing in terms of competition because we're seeing some
negative results from competitors and then the latest and thoughts on the U.S.
launch and how we think that uptake there.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. Thanks, Robbie. I'm going to have
Robert do that.

ROBERT B. FORD: So Robbie, we've talked about how this is a
multiyear opportunity, and we've been executing on this. Very, very focused
here. If you think about the Core Lab and the rollout of Alinity program, it's
doing very well. And you can see that in our top line. The rollout has been
particularly strong in Europe. We're winning over 50% of the businesses where
we targeted an entrenched competitor. And if you think about kind of the
renewal process, we're retaining nearly all of our current business that comes
up for contract. So we placed over 3,000 -- over 3,700 instruments. And when we
gave out that number, we're talking about instruments that are actually placed
in the market, placed in the account, running tests and generating revenue. So
that's gone very well.

In the quarter, you saw that we also got an approval in the
U.S. for the Alinity blood and plasma screening. So this fourth quarter here,
the team is already kind of rolling out that commercial launch. We had a lot of
success in rolling out the blood plasma systems in Europe and in Asia last
year. So it's great to see that a little bit ahead of schedule here in the U.S.
And the team has jumped on, on the opportunity.

As relates to the immunoassay side, a lot of our focus here
is really kind of ramping up on the R&D side, ramping up the menu and the
assay menu. I'd say that assay completion rate of what we need to be kind of
fully competitive in Europe is getting close to that 100% mark that we need.
And in the U.S., it's a little bit behind, but a lot of our focus here is to
get those systems, those assays approved and in place. And we'll start to see
that kind of play affecting our growth rate in the U.S. as we move into next
year. So I think, internationally, we're doing really well. U.S., we've got the
opportunity here as the assays come onboard to be able to accelerate our growth
rates. So I'm really pleased with the momentum that the team has done here. Of
course, we could -- we feel that we can always do better, and that's what we're
going to keep on pushing to.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS: Great. And maybe just one quick
follow-up in Neuromodulation. Numbers came in a little softer than The Street
was looking for. I'm assuming a big chunk of that was in the spinal cord stim
market. Maybe you could just update us as to what exactly you're seeing on the
ground with Abbott and what you think is driving the deceleration in the market
here in the U.S.?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes, sure. So obviously, still work in
progress here. It's a little bit longer than we had initially hoped. When we've
talked about it over the last couple of quarters, we've talked about the sales
force hiring, the sales force productivity. And it's a very specific selling
process here in devices. And if you're a new rep, it takes some time to kind of
understand it. So that's been going -- that's been progressing well. We've had
some stabilization in the sales force. And some of the monthly KPIs that we
track them on, they're improving. But we've also seen, as you pointed out, a
little bit of a market decline, especially in the first half of this year. And
it follows a couple of years of double-digit growth, right? So a lot of our
focus here has got to be on sales force execution and productivity.

The approval of Proclaim XR this quarter, I think, really
provides a nice addition to the portfolio. It provides the sales force with a
new technology to promote. And early signs of the launch, it's only been a
couple of weeks, but early signs are positive. We tend to look at our trials --
on our trials across the U.S. in spinal as our leading indicator. And I'd say,
early signs are positive, but there's more monitoring there for us to be aware
of.

On the market side, there's real no third-party data source
here like we have in stents or pacemakers, et cetera. So it's a little bit
difficult to peg the growth rate here. We usually have to wait until everybody
reports and can kind of look at and add it up and kind of see where it's at. So
I would anticipate here Q3 to be similar in terms of market growth rate as to
the first half of this year, which is in that low to mid-single-digit decline
here.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Rick Wise from
Stifel.

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE, MD & SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH
ANALYST, STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Miles, I'm always embarrassed to ask questions about the EPD business because I
always feel like I don't really understand it. But I understand enough to see
that you actually, x currency, had another solid quarter in many of the
emerging markets that you're targeting. Maybe just help us understand some of
your high-level thoughts there or the outlook. Is it going as you would have
expected? Growth has slowed a little bit relative to the last few years. But
again, seems like on track and sustainably on track. Is that the right way to
think about it?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. Rick, I'd say I'm never quite as
satisfied as I'd like to be. That's for sure. What -- we've learned a couple of
things. I think of the 7 or 8 years we've now been fundamentally focused on
emerging markets and their growing economies and so forth, I'd say, if anything
was underestimated, it was the degree of volatility of currency, which is also
heavily driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar. And while we can't predict
those things, since this business is 100% in emerging markets, that's always a
bit of a challenge. Now that said, the underlying growth in those markets has
been steadily strong. And it's interesting. One indicator of the attractiveness
for those markets is, let's just say, the multiples and prices and so forth
that anybody who owns a pharmaceutical business in those markets thinks that
the company is worth. And as we track those for a long time, they're probably
some of the highest multiples in the world than any business -- the businesses
that make money. They're attractive. The markets are attractive. The attractive
parts of branded, generic pharmaceutical worldwide, they're the most
profitable. They're very profitable markets for good branded products as
compared to Europe or the U.S. or something like that if you're in that
business. So we targeted this business for a reason. There's underlying real
growth. Brands matter. Quality matters. Breadth matters. And it's kind of all
the fundamentals that we think are stable, durable, attractive, et cetera. And
frankly, all those economies have progressed as we would like, maybe not as
stably and maybe not as strongly, in some cases, but the growth there is still
strong.

Our own challenge is the R&D investments, to continue to
expand product lines and product depth into the markets. We keep our R&D somewhat
decentralized by region. India has its own, Latin America has its own, et
cetera. We're always looking for greater and greater productivity and greater
and greater launch activity out of our teams. Every now and then, we're going
to run into an Argentina, a Venezuela or a tax issue in a country, like we did
in India a couple of years ago, et cetera that are going to put a dent in the
growth rate for a given year, and we've seen that. But the underlying
fundamentals are quite strong, quite good. And we keep plugging away at all the
fundamentals that we know how to manage. And as you can tell, this last year,
we've had steady sequential improvement in our performance, excluding exchange.
And they're up at 8%. I think that's pretty good. That means that we know how
to take the corrective actions to get stronger, to get better, to drive the
business better. And I think the fact that the managers of pharmaceutical
business are up to an 8% growth rate and looking forward to even improvement in
that -- I think that's pretty strong. So yes, we like the business.

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE: Great. And if I could follow up just
on 2 quick things. At TCT, we saw some very solid Portico data. I assume we're
still on track for mid-2020 U.S. launch. Any updates there would be great on
Portico. And last, just -- the U.S. Vascular business still seems pressured,
not really improving. What are the issues? What are you doing? I know you're so
focused on execution. Is it competition? Is it -- how do you turn that portion
of the business around?

ROBERT B. FORD: Rick, this is Robert here. So on your
Portico question, yes, we submitted end of Q3, so we expect a kind of midyear
approval here and launch. And we're getting ready for that.

On your question on Vascular, as we've previously mentioned,
there are a couple, what I would call, noncommercial items that impacted growth
rate here. These are third-party royalties, third-party manufacturing
agreements that we put in place as part of the St. Jude divestiture, some of
the assets. So those -- as those ramp down, as those manufacturing agreements
ramp down, those royalties ramp down, they obviously impact the growth rate.
And we've allocated those agreements into the U.S. line, even though they're
global agreements. So if you remove those items that are naturally going down
as we transition the manufacturing over to the new owners of those businesses
and as the royalties ramp down, you remove that out, our Vascular business was
flat. And the dynamic there was really a little bit of pricing that we've seen
on the stent side. We've continued to grow share in the U.S. actually and
maintain our leadership position in the international markets. And that price
pressure was then offset by double-digit growth in our Endo and peripheral
business and in our imaging and diagnostic business. And that's part of our
strategy, which is we know that there will be some pricing pressure on the DES
side, and we know we need to make our investments to maintain our competitive
position there. But we also know that we're over investing in our Endo and our
imaging strategy, so that those businesses can get large enough and that those
double digits then can really return Vascular to a healthy growth rate.

OPERATOR: And our last question comes from Matt Taylor from
UBS.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST OF MEDICAL
SUPPLIES & DEVICES, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: I was hoping
that you might just expound a little bit on the Libre dynamics given the
continued strength that you've seen outside the U.S. Could you comment on
anything like installed base, mix of type 1 versus type 2? Are payers getting
involved? Do they see value there? Anything like that, that could help us
understand the sustainability of the growth, especially outside the U.S. where
you continue to have a larger and larger base?

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes. So let's talk about that base. I mean,
the one way to describe it here that it's pretty large and it's growing. We
focus a lot on the sales side. But if you look at the user base where you're at
the 1.5 million, close to 1.6 million users at the end of this quarter, as we
talked a little bit, there's a little bit of constraint on that user base given
our manufacturing capacity. So as we've now unleashed it, I think we've got the
potential here to kind of grow that user base even faster.

One of the things that is important here that we've seen as
payers and contract start to look at this is that they're very convinced on the
outcomes of using sensor-based technology. There's a lot of clinical data that
proves that. We actually have RCT trials that show that Libre reduces hypo,
reduces time out of range, reduces the time that patients are in hypoglycemia.
And we backed it up with some fairly large real world evidence trials showing
that. And competitors also have that, too.

So the value proposition here is how do you get that outcome
at a cost that makes sense for the payer where they can actually expand the use
of the product and the technology into a much larger user base versus kind of niching
it to kind of very small segments. And that's been the value proposition that
we've adopted. And as I said in the beginning of the call, that value
proposition is not only very intact, but it is growing. And we see that in the
negotiations we've had with Canadian reimbursement authorities. We see that
expansion of the technology beyond just type 1 or insulin users in other
markets. We start seeing it expand into type 2. So we think the value
proposition here is very strong, and it's a real opportunity to provide the
benefits of the outcomes that are proven at a cost profile that makes sense for
the payers. So -- and it's ultimately about having the impact on outcomes for
patients. And we're seeing that through our trials and through our real world evidence.

If you think about the composition of the patients, we're
looking at 50-50. We're getting a lot of type 1s and insulin users, but we're
also getting a lot of type 2s, type 2s that are on single injections or type 2s
that are on oral medication. There are different utilization rates, but we're
getting all those patients.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR: One quick follow-up. Are you now
completely unconstrained on manufacturing?

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. I'm going to wrap up where we started.
We had a strong quarter, exceptionally strong quarter. Our momentum continues.
We've got some great growth drivers in Libre, MitraClip, the Alinity platforms,
other businesses. They're all growing, many of them double digits and across
the board. So the balance of that performance across all businesses and across
all geographies is heartening. It is sustainable. We -- our top line growth
rate was 7.6% this quarter. We think it will be close to 8% in the fourth
quarter. And as we look into 2020, I see no reason to change any expectations
about the strength of our top line sales growth rate, which is, I think, all of
you know, for a fairly large company, unusual to find. The other people that
are able to do this are tech companies. And so we've got some great strengths
here owing to the strength of our pipeline, our new product launches, the
improvements to access and/or reimbursements and further capabilities of those
products. So we've got a good sustainable road ahead of us. Obviously, there
are surprises or things that don't meet our expectations from time to time or
the speed with which we want to accomplish things. But overall, I think this is
good evidence to you all, a good performance, super performance, really, and
sustainably so. We look at 2020 with great optimism and great expectations, in
spite of a lot of the uncertainties in the world and in the economies around
the world. We're feeling pretty strong and pretty bullish about where we sit.
So with that, we'll see you in 90 days.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any
participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the
entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed
written permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Good
morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Ford, President and Chief
Operating Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief
Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian will discuss
our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, we'll
take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties
that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological
and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A,
risk factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Abbott undertakes no obligation to
release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of
subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that
second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for
sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations
only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless
otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth,
which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES D. WHITE, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD & CEO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Thank you, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported results of
another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.82, above our
previous guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth. Sales increased
7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter with all 4 businesses exceeding
expectations.

I'm particularly pleased with our ability to consistently
achieve these types of strong results. Over the past 2 years, our quarterly
organic sales growth has averaged more than 7%. And importantly, we're well
positioned with our portfolio and new product pipeline for this type of strong
growth going forward.

Based on our performance and momentum in the first half of
the year, we're raising our full year outlook, and we now forecast adjusted
earnings per share of $3.21 to $3.27, reflecting nearly 13% growth at the
midpoint on a reported basis and even faster growth when excluding the impact
of foreign exchange.

While we achieved broad-based growth across several areas of
our portfolio, I'd like to highlight just a few areas where we continue to
perform exceptionally well.

I'll start our Medical Devices business with FreeStyle
Libre, where we achieved sales of $430 million and continued to add
significantly to our global user base, as reflected by our organic sales growth
of more than 70% in the quarter. We also continue to make excellent progress
expanding reimbursement and access in the U.S., where Libre is now reimbursed
for approximately 75% of people with private pharmacy benefit insurance.

Libre offers a unique value proposition. And as by design,
it provides great clinical benefits, and we priced it to ensure affordability.
Peers recognize that value -- that recognize that value and are increasingly
providing reimbursement coverage for Libre, which also lower out-of-pocket
costs even further for patients.

As I've mentioned before, we've been investing significantly
to expand our manufacturing capacity for Libre to meet demand. The first wave
of that expansion will come online in the next couple of months, followed by a
cadence of incremental capacity after that. There's a massive population that
needs help managing their diabetes, and our intent is to make Libre broadly
accessible to all of them.

Turning to our Structural Heart business, where we achieved
mid-teens growth. This was led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the
treatment of mitral regurgitation, which had global sales growth of more than
30% in the quarter. And MitraClip grew more than 50% in the U.S., where we
recently received a new expanded indication.

Earlier this week, we announced U.S. approval of our fourth
generation MitraClip device, which builds on this leading platform with
enhanced features and new clip sizes, providing physicians further options when
treating the disease. We've been building our position in Structural Heart for
more than a decade and have a deep pipeline of technologies and development,
including Tendyne and Cephea, which are minimally invasive devices to replace
faulty mitral heart valves.

TriClip, a first of its kind device for the repair of a
leaky tricuspid heart valve; and AMPLATZER Amulet, our left atrial appendage
device, to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. With
the rapid adoption of MitraClip in a highly underpenetrated market as well as a
pipeline of technologies targeting new growth areas that will launch over the
next several years, our Structural Heart business is well positioned for
strong, steady growth for years to come.

Next, Diagnostics, where we remain focused on the global
rollout of our Alinity suite of instruments for every area of diagnostics in
which we compete. We're making great progress with our systems for immunoassay
in clinical chemistry testing in Europe, where the launch of Alinity is helping
to drive double-digit growth in our international core laboratory business.
We're now also in the early stages of launching Alinity instruments for
hematology and molecular testing in Europe.

In the U.S., we're making steady progress achieving
regulatory approvals for our broad menu of core laboratory tests. And just last
week, we announced the FDA approval of Alinity s for blood and plasma screen.

Abbott screens the majority of the world's blood supply, and
this system is designed to be faster and more efficient within a smaller amount
of space while maintaining the highest levels of accuracy. The global rollout
of Alinity is an ambitious undertaking that positions our Diagnostics business
for sustainable, strong growth going forward.

So in summary, all 4 of our businesses exceeded expectations
in the quarter. Our growth is strong, it's accelerating and it's sustainable.
We've strategically positioned ourselves in some of the most attractive areas
of health care, and our key growth platforms are delivering impressive results.
And today, we're adding to what was already a strong growth forecast by raising
our outlook for the year. I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our
results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?

BRIAN B. YOOR, EXECUTIVE VP OF FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Okay. Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that
all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic
basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.

Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter
increased 7.5%. Sales in medical devices grew 10.5% with double-digit growth in
Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. In
Nutrition, sales increased 5.1%, led by a strong growth in Adult Nutrition.
Sales in Established Pharmaceuticals grew 6.1% with 8% growth in our key
emerging markets. And sales increased 6.2% in Diagnostics, led by high
single-digit growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics and sequential improvements
in point-of-care and Rapid Diagnostics.

Exchange had an unbearable impact on total Abbott sales of
4.6%, which was approximately 0.5% more unfavorable to our expectations at the
time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the
adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.4% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was
7.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.9% of sales.

The second quarter adjusted tax rate was 13.7%, lower than
our previous full year guidance of around 15%, due entirely to continued
implementation of and adaptation to the U.S. tax reform regulations. Our second
quarter tax rate reflects the aggregate adjustment to align our tax rate for
the first half of 2019 with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast
of 14.5%.

Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast
organic sales growth of 7% to 8%. Based on current rates, we would expect
exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 3% on our full year
reported sales, which is in line with the expected impact we had at the
beginning of the year. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little
less than 59.5% of sales for the full year. This is modestly lower than our
prior forecast and reflects the temporary effect of investments to support the
unprecedented ramp-up and market adoption of our Alinity diagnostics systems as
well as investments in Libre capacity expansion.

We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat less
than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. And
as I mentioned previously, we forecasted an adjusted tax rate of around 14.5%
for the full year 2019.

Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we forecast
adjusted EPS of $0.83 to $0.85, which reflects strong double-digit growth. We
forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, and, at current rates, we would
expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 1.5% on our third quarter
reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less
than 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and
adjusted SG&A expense of around 29% of sales.

Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a
quick overview of our third quarter organic sales growth outlook by business.
For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid- to high single digit growth.
In Nutrition, we forecast mid-single-digit growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast
Abbott's legacy diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of core laboratory,
molecular and point-of-care to grow high single digits. And in Rapid
Diagnostics, we forecast low to mid-single-digit growth. And finally, in
Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit growth, which reflects continued
double-digit growth in several areas of this business.

With that, we'll now open the call up for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question
comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Congrats on the quarter and the guide. And Miles, I have 2 questions for you,
the first on diabetes, the second on the outlook for the year. So just starting
with diabetes, ADA, Miles, ushered in some concerns around the Libre 2.0 iCGM
designation. Should investors read anything into the lack of approval? And
what's your confidence level on iCGM approval? And what does the trend in BGM
this particular quarter tell us about the Libre adoption?

MILES D. WHITE: I'm going to give you a couple of answers
here. One, no, we shouldn't have concern. We're confident that we're going to
have the approval we expect and what we applied for. So I know that there's
always uncertainty until the day comes and questions from investors that know
we're confident. And actually, let me ask our COO to give you a little bit of
more background and detail on that.

ROBERT B. FORD, PRESIDENT & COO, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Yes. I mean, we -- David, we filed this in iCGM. We made that comment in our
last earnings, and we filed as an iCGM. The standards and special controls for
the iCGM, they're very clear and they're very transparent as it relates to accuracy,
thresholds, alarms, sensor shutoffs, et cetera. So we wouldn't have filed an
iCGM if we felt that we're going to fall short of those special controls. In
fact, we were encouraged by the agency to file Libre 2 as an iCGM. So I know
people want to speculate and kind of tie it to the exact date. We're not behind
our timelines, so we're not going to expect there an exact date here, but we
expect it relatively soon.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Okay, very, very helpful. And then the,
secondly, Miles, for you is just guidance for the year. So the guidance range
suggests, you obviously see 2019 as a year of acceleration over '18. I'm just
sort of curious, what gets better into the second half of the year? And if you
think about the middle part of the range versus the upper part of the range,
what are the key success factors in the back half that gets you to that top end
of the range?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I'd say a couple of things, first of
all, about the guidance. We are seeing strength in our growth drivers. We've
got a lot of launches going on in all segments across the board. We're going to
be opening up the capacity, new manufacturing and so forth to supplement Libre.
The Alinity systems are obviously successfully rolling out. MitraClip is
picking up momentum. A lot of the businesses that I've been sort of chronically
dissatisfied with from time to time have also in sequential improvement, which
I'm happy to see. I'm never quite satisfied with that. But the pharmaceutical
business, the cardiac rhythm management business, the stent business,
neuromodulation, the point-of-care Diagnostics business, the Rapid Diagnostics
business, which is primarily the Alere acquisition, they're all showing
sequential sales growth improvement, which is what we've planned, what we've
worked for, et cetera. So based on the strength across the board of all of
that, we felt comfortable that, frankly, our growth rate on the top line going
forward, we sort of see in that 7% to 8% range. And I challenged the team. I
said, is this temporary for the quarter or for the half year thing? Or do we
feel fairly sustainable about this? And we feel sustainable about it.

So I think that's all good. And then with record earnings,
there's a step-up in earnings here in the second half, earnings growth rate.
And it's just an unusual quarter. I mean, we always target, as you know, at the
beginning of the year, double-digit growth. We always had kind of an aggressive
or at least ambitious target for ourselves going into the next year. That's no
different now. So in the second half, our earnings remain strong. I don't know,
I'm kind of -- I feel pretty good if we do the numbers we say and we never fall
short. So it's 18% on the bottom line right now. So you're asking me about what
we do to get to the high end of the range? I'm thinking, geez, isn't that good
enough? It's a pretty healthy growth rate. So 7% to 8% on the top and high
double digit teens on the bottom, I think, is probably best-in-class in the
peer group that we're compared to and several different peer groups that we're
compared to. And quite frankly, with the breadth of products launching and
rollouts, obviously, there's always challenges somewhere in the world in some
way, but we seem to be doing pretty well across the board here in all areas, and
I think that's a pretty good investment.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from
JPMorgan.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Great, and congrats on a good quarter. Maybe 2 product
questions for you. I want to hit on MitraClip and Alinity. Maybe you could
comment on the status of CMS reimbursement in MitraClip. It doesn't seem to
have hindered your growth at all in the quarter, but maybe just give us some
update on the timelines, and then maybe some considerations for the trend line
of uptick going forward there once you do get approval.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. I'm going to have Robert answer that
question for you, and we'll come back to Alinity.

ROBERT B. FORD: So Robbie, so you saw we had a great quarter
of MitraClip, global sales over 30%, really driven by U.S. over 50%, the
majority of that growth in U.S. really coming through increased productivity in
the existing accounts. So we obviously were constantly doing market
development, opening new accounts, but a majority of that growth coming through
increased utilization. So we've continued to invest in clinical and field sales
expansion. And when you do this, they have this direct impact in account
utilization and productivity. International was up also double digits in the
quarter. You've got Japan, where we believe is a significant opportunity for us
long term there where we're building our capabilities in Japan. And Europe saw
a rebound in Q2 versus where we were in Q1. I think the teams there, the clinical
and medical teams have done a really good job at putting into context and
framing some of those conflicting trials that came out in the second half of
the year.

So we think there's a lot of sustainability here not only in
the U.S. I mean, our penetration rates here, in terms of the opportunity, are
still kind of low single digits. So we've got a lot of runway here. Regarding
your question on CMS, I mean, there's obviously a lot of coordination that's
been going on between CMS and the physician societies. We expect the NCD to be
opened up a very soon as part of that coordination. As I say, we're not going
to forecast an exact timeline here, but we anticipate getting through the
process around year-end early next year. But as you said, the process here
hasn't really kind of impeded our growth.

We have seen a dozen or so private commercial insurance
companies already reflect updates to their decision to their coverage to
include the new indication. Obviously, the larger segment there is the Medicare
segment, but it's good to kind to see that traction in the private segment. So
very good quarter. We continue to see this expansion in the second half of the
year and towards the end of the year looking at achieving the CMS
reimbursement.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS: Great. And then following up on
Alinity. This is one -- it hits all of your different product lines and
diagnostics, so it's hard to really pick out, but maybe you could just give us
a status update on the progress of the launch in Europe and the just starting
launch in the U.S. And maybe any competitive data points you could give us. We
see some of your competitors struggling, both on the top line and the margins
side, as it relates to competitive systems. Anything you're seeing out in the
market that could be useful. Appreciate it.

MILES D. WHITE: Sure. Well, so first, you made a comment
that it touches every part of diagnostics. That's true. And these are 6
different systems, the immunoassay system, the clinical chemistry system,
obviously a smaller point of care system for that market. There's a dedicated
blood and plasma screening system, and then, of course, hematology and
molecular. And they're all at various stages of rollout. The one that is the
furthest along would be the rollout of our immunoassay and clinical chemistry
systems in the core laboratories of Europe. We're also in the process of
expanding menu approvals in the United States and China and Southeast Asia,
where customers want to have a certain critical mass of menu as they make the conversion
from whatever they're using to these new Alinity systems.

So I'd say we're running as fast as we can, I think, at this
point, in Europe, and that's going pretty well. There's over 3,000 systems
placed now running test, generating revenue, et cetera. We do measure not just
the deal, the close of a deal, et cetera. We measure what is called test of
record when the account is up and running, generating results, generating
tests, et cetera.

And so I'd say that process is going well. That's going to begin
to pick up more momentum in the United States as we're getting more and more
menu breadth. Same with China. We're tracking all of that pretty closely as we
build those menus. We're talking hundreds of tests. We did recently get
approval for the Alinity as the blood and plasma screening system. Today, we
screen about 80% of the world's blood supply as it is. This is -- it's an
important transition product that labs, I think, will find more efficient, more
economic, et cetera, but that's a plus.

We closed and started up the Japanese Red Cross, which is
the largest Japanese blood screening organization, and we took that from a
long-standing Japanese competitor. So that was a big win for us. So there's
just a lot of success that way.

Hematology's in the very early stages of rolling out, the
molecular system in the earliest stage of rolling out. And which is why this
will be, I guess, a slower moving launch that's got sort of years of growth and
momentum in it as we look over the next, call it, 5 to 7 years to completely
replace an existing installed base and add a lot of new share and new volume.
And to that end, I think we've quoted you before, that remains true. In
accounts where we already have the business, we're winning about 95% of the
time. And in accounts where we do not have the business, and there's an
entrenched competitor of ours, we're winning about 60% of the time. Those win
rates and penetration rates and share gains and so forth in our experience so
far, over now what I said is over 3,000 instruments, tell us that we've got a
very competitive system. We do run into, on the occasional accounts, a
heavy-duty price-cutting.

We've got a very disciplined system of our pricing and
contracting in accounts. We have not had to do that. I think that speaks to the
superiority of the instrument and assay offering. So we're feeling like our
offering is uniquely competitive. It's borne out by the win rates no matter
what type of account. It's unprecedented to launch these many systems
across-the-board in all areas. So I think this only picks up momentum and gets
better as the assay menu expands and as there's some experience in the field
with the analyzers.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank
of America.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFA MERRILL
LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just 2 quick questions, one for Miles and a big
picture, and then one quick financial question if okay. Miles, if okay, I
wanted to ask a question on the management team additions that you announced
recently. Congrats on hiring Lisa to run devices. And I guess, my question is,
when Robert was promoted as COO back on October of last year, Abbott said that
Robert would keep devices. So just wondering if you could comment on kind of
the reasons for the change, what Robert will do with all his newfound free
time. And investors are always curious about your long-term plans. So it's a
question on the recent hire.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. Well, I can tell you he's not playing
golf. We -- I'd say a couple of things. First of all, we anticipated that for
the time being, we wanted him to stay directly on top of the medical device
business because he's been responsible for the bringing onboard St. Jude. As we
acquired that, he was integral to that entire integration. We went through,
with St. Jude, a reorganization of the business to align with the way we like
to run a business at Abbott. And I guess I would describe that as we like to
have a fully integrated business, meaning the general manager of that business,
president of that business has responsibility for commercial -- the commercial
people, commercial sales, of the customers, et cetera, but also manufacturing,
R&D, technical support, service, et cetera. We like all those functions
reporting into one GM.

And so we realigned St. Jude. We did the same with Alere,
quite frankly, when we took them over. And so each of the business has full
integrated general management responsibility. And that was a transition, and
Robert led that. It's all in place. That meant that we added a number of
experienced general managers. We replaced some who had left us as part of the
St. Jude or Alere acquisitions and so forth. So we went through a management
transition. And at the same time, there's been a little bit of a generational
change happening here. Quite certainly, there's been an awful lot of people
that has been part of my management team for a long time. And a lot of our
managers are long-term Abbott groomed and grown management team, but we've also
been thinking about making sure that with all the growth we've got, the new
products, the new organization, the new structure of that organization that
we're always looking at the talent and the experience of our management team as
we look forward now toward, let's just call it, a decade of what I think is
going to be pretty robust growth.

So in that, we needed to replace the EVP role that Robert
has held previous to his Chief Operating Officer role. We did that. We went
outside for that and, of course, sourced Lisa, who we think has terrific
background and experience for that. We're very pleased to have brought fresh
perspective and great experience and great energy level into the company. So
we're very pleased with that.

We went through a little further, I'd say, organization
change to kind of break up what had gotten big and perhaps unwieldy, in some
cases, into slightly smaller units because we are managing some pretty
aggressive growth capital improvement, plant building, et cetera, in a number
of these businesses, including diagnostics. And to give us more focus around
it, we've done some of that adjusting.

I feel like that's gone very smoothly and very well.
Obviously, we read into Robert, who's in his mid-40s, moving up into the COO
role, that we expect him to be in a key leadership role at the company for a
long time. Read between the lines.

And so there's a preparation process going on. And I think
one of the most important things I can do, after leading the company for so
long, is to make sure that when a transition comes, nobody notices. And the
best legacy to leave is that the momentum of this company. Its growth and its
prospects are every bit as good going forward as we think they are now and,
from my perspective, a smooth leadership transition, which is not just me, it's
literally right down through the upper ranks of all management is key and
important. And I feel like of all of the sort of track record of legacies that
I can give this company, I think a transition that way is probably the most
important of all.

So you can read into it that we're preparing for continuity
of leadership, what I would call it, with no speed bumps. And I think that
actually is going exceptionally well. Will I give you a time frame? No. Do I
think we should be nervous about it? No. I think that this company is so poised
to perform well across the board for years to come that I've got great
confidence in that continuity and the management team because we've got a nice
mix here of very experienced and trained Abbott people and people we've brought
from other companies on the outside like Lisa. And I think the mix we've got in
that team is exceptional. Robert's been with the company over 20 years. I've
known him every bit of those 20-plus years, and I think he brings to his job
right now tremendous experience, perspective, everything you would look for in
a leader, as a COO of the company. So from my perspective, I think this is
nothing but good and just keeps getting better.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS: Very, very helpful, Miles. That's great
perspective. And just, it seems like an odd transition, but I do have a little
question on the tax rate. Just quickly for Brian. You guys have been doing a
great job over the last couple of years of kind of slowly and steadily bringing
the tax rate down. And I know you made comments on the year, but maybe if you
could just talk bigger picture. Is -- where are you in that process? And are
the current rates that we're seeing here today sustainable down here in the
kind of low-ish teens?

BRIAN B. YOOR: Yes, Bob. We always set the tax rate to where
we think it's sustainable. We don't like it to be bounced around. We want to be
steady. And we assess the rates as they come out. We had a series of rates come
out just recently and digested those. We're always adapting to that and adapting
to the situation to be as efficient as we can here. 14.5% is where I'd call the
sustainable rate right now as we look forward. I will say, and we can't predict
the future, but there's another series of clarity around rates that will come
up in Q3. And when that happens, we will digest that and adapt accordingly as
well. But as we sit here today, we're happy with the efficiency of our tax rate
and continue to manage it for sustainability. And we just don't want to see it
bumping around on you or us.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from
Barclays.

KRISTEN MARIE STEWART, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on a great quarter. Miles, I was wondering if you
could just talk through your thinking on just the level of investments in the
company and just how you think about how much of this really impressive top
line you let flow through, and then also, just from a capital allocation
perspective, how you're just thinking about going forward with the company, just
given the growth dynamics that you have and/or opportunities you could see to
maybe strengthen some of the other business lines that maybe offer a little bit
more lackluster growth with the medical devices.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. Well, I'd give you a couple of
perspectives. First of all, the great thing is we've got a lot of things to
invest in. From a capital standpoint, obviously, it was important for us to pay
down debt. We did. We've paid down a significant amount going on $10 billion at
this point. And as we've said before, we're in a comfortable position of
strategic flexibility, but that doesn't mean we're dying to go use it.

So the next need was, obviously, we've got some capital to
put into plant and expansion, and we've put a fair amount into both Diagnostics
and Libre at this point. We're investing in expansion of plant and
manufacturing for MitraClip and other products. So given that we've got an
awful lot of growth happening and the potential for more, obviously, we've got
to support that growth from a plant and capital standpoint in a timely fashion
and appropriate quality and so forth, and we're doing that. And so there's
capital use, et cetera, there. Will we continue to pay down debt? We will.
We'll be prudent and careful about making sure it makes sense it's the right
debt, right time and all that good stuff.

We'll maintain a healthy, strong dividend. We increased it
substantially at the end of last year. We'll continue to grow our dividend.
Given where the PE is now, I've been told by a number of shareholders that
trying to get that yield rate upward dividend funds are happy as is difficult,
but that's a nice problem to have. We will continue to grow our dividend. It's
been a hallmark of the company for decades, and it will continue to be. And then
it's not always that prudent to buy back shares. The timing matters, the return
matters, et cetera. Is it an option? Yes, it is. I probably won't get too
carried away because, frankly, we're able to grow and return cash to
shareholders a number of different ways and return good return to our
shareholders. So it's always an option as it presents itself. We've just got a
lot we can do. If you're asking about M&A and other things, we don't feel
like right now that we need something, nor do we think we see something that we
can add sufficient value to, to make it worth it to invest in. And we've got so
many organic growth opportunities that, while we continue to monitor and we're
always tracking opportunities in all of our businesses, I can't tell you that,
that's real front burner right now. We don't ignore it. We don't -- we try to
maintain our currency on the things that we might be interested in. We just did
a small acquisition in Germany. That's a nice adjunctive thing to our
Diagnostics business in terms of automation and so forth. There are things like
that, that I think are valuable for us. But we have so much growth potential
and opportunity in devices, diagnostics, even nutrition and pharma that we're
just not out cut and real hard on the M&A front right now, nor do I foresee
that being true for quite a while. So that's the capital side.

On the expense side, we're always trying to balance the
voracious appetite of investors for growing earnings with investing in the
growth of the business. And I doubt that there's a general manager or business
at Abbott that wouldn't claim that if we gave them more money, they could spend
it effectively and efficiently to grow our products faster. So we're always
trying to find the right balance of how much gas that's thrown in the fire or
the growth of the products with returning a healthy return to the expectations
of our investors. I think that's always a balance because there's always some
investor who thinks there must be an extra $0.01 in the quarter. And I was speaking
to somebody this morning who asked about that very issue of another $0.01. And
I said, "The issue here is much bigger than $0.01." We've got
tremendous growth. Our top line were accelerating. It's strong. It's
sustainable. This isn't about $0.01 in a given quarter, this is about a pretty,
healthy sales growth rate and a commensurate healthy growth rate on the bottom
line that's unusual in our sector and particularly unusual for companies of our
size to be able to sustain such a healthy growth rate with so much new product
richness for the coming years. And it's not a coming quarter, it's coming
years.

So you raised the right question, is how do we keep
investing in the spending in R&D and the sales and marketing expenses to
drive that growth? And we're trying to find that right balance as well by
putting enough fuel to the fire here to drive the growth rates even higher

KRISTEN MARIE STEWART: Okay, then. Just one question on how
do you view -- the medical device business growth was phenomenal this quarter.
How do you just think about the ability to sustain that level of growth? It
seems that Medical Devices has a bit of a tale of 2 cities with several
businesses reporting really nice, strong double-digit growth, but a couple of
obvious businesses kind of still lagging around that flattish growth. How do
you kind of think about the longer-term dynamic there?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. You've got a mix of business this year.
You've got some that are a little mature than others, some that have brand new
products that are perfect innovations. In general, in Medical Devices,
innovation is what drives the growth. And over time, that's the case. And
different businesses are at different stages of either maturity or new
innovation. We believe there's still a lot of opportunity there.

I remember in my discussions with Dan Starks when we were
renegotiating over the acquisition of St. Jude, Dan felt pretty strongly that
the pipeline of St. Jude was underappreciated and, that in their own internal
models, that the growth rate was out there in the high single digits. The
Street didn't agree with that at the time because it didn't see it yet, et
cetera. But Dan was right, and I think that we've seen that in the performance
of the medical device business we acquired from St. Jude because it's been
performing at sort of a 9% to 10% level as new products have gone to the
market, either replacing older products or just simply brand new products
altogether.

So I'd say the first thing about Medical Devices is you've
got to keep innovating in new spaces. MitraClip's new space, Heart Failure and
HeartMate and so forth, these are new spaces, new technologies, et cetera.
Libre is that. Libre is unique. It approaches a mass market, not a niche
market. Most medical devices address niches of therapy. But diabetes is
something that affects more than 80 million people around the world who would
benefit from Libre in about a 50-50 split of type 1s and type 2s. And that is
massive. It's unlike anything seen before in device for diagnostic businesses.
And so there's just an enormous, enormous opportunity there. To be honest,
traditional medical device companies aren't used to having to deal with at that
kind of scale.

And so we're addressing that by investing very heavily in
manufacturing expansion, so that we can go after the mass market, not a niche.
And so I think the sustainability of the growth is driven not only by the
innovation, but the ability to go after much bigger markets at a much more
affordable level. More people will have access. There will be more growth as we
make technologies and products more and more affordable.

And then finally, you asked about some of the businesses
that aren't growing that fast. And I'd say, well, I'm always disappointed that
they're not growing as fast as we'd like them to, but I am pleased that we've
seen sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter in almost all of them. We've
seen that in CRM. We've seen it neuromod. We've seen it even EPD and stents and
so forth. We're seeing incremental improvement. Some of these businesses as
more mature businesses may not see strong or high single digit or double digit
growth, but I think they're still capable of pretty strong growth in the low to
mid-single-digit area, and there's still a lot of upside.

If we take a CRM business from what is flat slightly
negative to 3% or 4%, that's a pretty big bump in growth. We'd be -- if it was
going from 10% to 14%, we'd be all excited about it. So the same incremental
growth improvement, I think, is possible. It's just at a lower level. So I
think that there's a lot here to sustain the kind of growth we're seeing.
There's always going to be new products like Libre or a MitraClip or a
HeartMate that singularly for a period of time disproportionally drive the
overall growth. One of the benefits of having many businesses in the device
arena is there's always going to be somewhere that's growing that way and other
places where we're innovating for the future.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch
from BMO Capital Markets.

JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH, MD & RESEARCH ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL
MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: I'd like to spend a little bit of time on Nutrition,
particularly international nutrition. And the adult piece of that really did
well in the quarter. Is there anything you could give us as an update on that
particular franchise?

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes. So we had a, as you've noticed,
sequential improvement in our Nutrition business. We're very pleased with the
performance. We continue to see kind of above market growth in several of the
countries. We've made a lot of enhancements and changes in people and
strategies to enhance our competitiveness over the years, new products
execution, and we get to see that. We do think it is sustainable. We are
executing well. We kind of see the market in that 3% to 4% range. So -- and
we're always striving for something above that. And you saw that again in this
quarter with a 5% kind of growth and good execution in our adult business
specifically coming out of Asia.

MILES D. WHITE: To OUS business, Joanne, was up a little
over 10% in the adult, OUS adult business. And a lot of that is new product
innovation, new formats, expansion in given markets like Vietnam and other
places, where we've got pretty good strongholds, but also a lot of opportunity
for further growth.

So we've put a lot more intention on some of those. I'd say
historically, in this business, the U.S. and China always get all the
attention. But there's a lot of opportunity in, as Robert said, Southeast Asian
markets and others, where there's still a lot of growth, India and the like,
and particularly in the adult segment.

JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH: And as my second question, one of the
"problem children" in Medical Devices is in neuromodulation. Can you
walk us through a pathway to the recovery in that?

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes, sure. So we saw an improvement in Q2.
Obviously, that's not our landing spot. We're obviously not where we want to
be, but an improvement there. We completed the sales force expansion that we've
been talking about. We increased the sales force by about 40%. And when you go
through something like that, Joanne, there's some disruption that occurs in
terms of cutting the territories and the training, et cetera. So we've
completed that, and now, obviously, the focus is improving the productivity of
that sales team. And we saw that in the second quarter. If you look at some of
the KPIs, we look at whether it's trials or trial to permanent implant
conversion rates. We saw definitely sequential improvement versus Q1, and we
expect that to improve as we go into the second half of this year.

A big portion of this also is, I'd say, product innovation
life cycle. You've seen a couple of quarters now where there really hasn't been
any kind of launch from competitors in this space. That's a key driver also. So
sales force productivity and execution, we'll start to see some of our
innovation output we made double the investment in that R&D business over
the last couple of years. And we'll start to see some output of that in the second
half of this year, beginning of next year in terms of new products that will
provide, I'd say, more for the sales team to kind of work with.

OPERATOR: And our final question comes from Matthew Taylor
from UBS.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST OF MEDICAL
SUPPLIES & DEVICES, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to
circle back on Libre on 2 points. So the first is that you mentioned that
you're working on increasing the capacity. There was an article yesterday, and
Reuters said that you're expanding capacity by 3x or 5x. And so if we think
about Libre this year as approaching maybe $2 billion based on consensus, does
that mean that ultimately, you think it could be a $6 billion to $10 billion
type of product as you go mass market? And can you talk about how you can step
on the gas in the second half of the year without additional capacity in the
approval of Libre 2 to more rapidly expand use?

MILES D. WHITE: Man, you are one aggressive guy. I remember
I've got this call or this question last quarter, I can't recall if it was you,
on whether we thought we could get the $5 billion and how soon, and gosh, 3
months later, it's $10 billion. I've got the same ambitions, to be honest. I
just wouldn't have expected them 90 days later. But to answer your question, I
think that kind of potential is there. I think it's awfully hard to speculate
about a number that big. But will we -- do I think we'll get the $5 billion?
And do I think we'll do it in a reasonable time, $5 billion of sales over? Yes,
I do. And I think it's -- the growth rate here is reflective of not only the
size of the market, but the need and utility and affordability of the product.
And I think it's just, as I've said many times, it's a very different market
where affordability and the utility, the access, all those things make this a
mass market product, not a niche. And it's designed for that. It's priced for
that. It's a very profitable product. And we're going through the large-scale,
scale-up of addressing that kind of growth, which is unprecedented for products
in our space.

So do I think it can grow to that sort of level? I won't
jinx anything by trying to make some prognostication about $10 billion, but I
would say that I think it's got enormous potential. And it's got potential
beyond glucose. It's got potential as a wearable in other analytes and other
products over time. We have R&D programs underway, not only for the
repeated enhancement, improvement, expansion of Libre, but also in the other
categories beyond diabetes and other analytes and so forth. So I think that
there's just a lot of things that will evolve over the coming years here that,
today, people weren't even contemplating with the product. We're going as hard
as we can at the glucose opportunity, which is enormous. But there's so much
more beyond that, that, I think, at least to your aspirational consideration,
to be honest, has validity. I'm just not ready to put any numbers around it.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR: And then maybe one last follow-up.
That was a great answer, but just wanted to get your feedback on what you think
is misunderstood about Libre today when you get feedback from investors that
bubbles up to you. Where do you think that the internal view of Libre really
differs from The Street's perception or people's perception?

MILES D. WHITE: Geez, I don't know. Let me ask the COO. He's
been living with it a long time.

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes. I think when we went out about this
several years ago, the challenge here, Matt, wasn't to get an accurate reading
of glucose from interstitial fluid. Navigator, when we have launched it back in
2008, we were able to do that. It was very accurate, and we're able to get an
accurate reading. The challenge that we went about with Libre is how to do that
in a way that is cost-effective for the health systems and for consumers and
for all of that. So that was what we really went after, is how can you get the
accurate reading at a cost position at the core of Libre? And you might
remember at the time, Navigator at the time was considered the most accurate
sensor. In the core of Libre is that chemistry, is that core technology of
Navigator, which provides accurate, reliable readings, but we're able to do
that at a cost position that now makes sense for the insurance and for the
payer community and the health systems to cover it. It wasn't a question of
whether the outcomes were right or whether the outcomes were enough. They were
convinced that the outcomes were there for sensor-based glucose monitoring. It
was just, can I now do it in a way that makes sense for me to do it on a mass
scale? And Miles just talked about this about mass scale. That's what we went
after 10 years ago. And that's at the core. And I think maybe that's
misunderstood because a lot of this discussion gets focused on, well, accuracy
at this level and accuracy at that level. And the reality is accuracy is
obviously important, but our goal here is to make this massively available
without having to sacrifice accuracy. And the fact that we priced it at a different
price point wouldn't say necessarily imply that it's somehow missing something,
we just have a different strategy and adjustment view of what we could do.

MILES D. WHITE: The only product out there that The Street
has been able to compare it to is expensive and high cost and aimed at a niche
in the United States. Ours is not expensive, and it's not high cost. It does
not lack for clinical performance, accuracy or any of the like. But because the
manufacturing is so sophisticated and automated, we were able to achieve a
pretty low cost in what is a pretty sophisticated product. It's a highly
profitable product, so we haven't compromised that it's a product that is
successful in terms of profit. That's not been compromised at all. It has a
completely different design and approach and cost structure. It relies on scale
for that cost, and we've actually seen improving gross margin.

We've told you before the gross margin is over 60%. It is
and rising. And that's with a heavy capital investment, so that we can produce
the kind of volume that is broadly available. So I think among the
misunderstandings out there, I think people say, "Well, geez, how do you
make money?" Oh, we make money. We do just fine, thank you. And the
product is designed to be affordable and accessible. I guess, there are some
days when we think, if the health care market community ensures payers,
Congress, patients, whatever, I always say it's got to be lower cost. The
health care has got to be more affordable. Here's our example. And it is. It's
massively so. And so we've gone at it with that approach to make it broadly
available. Broadly, in this case means 80 million people worldwide. That's
unprecedented.

So I'm not sure that the device community has totally
understood it because it's so different. But we keep saying so. And I think now
as the new capacity comes online, we've also staged the capacity so that
literally, every 90 days, we're adding another increment, significant
incremental capacity. We will not be capacity-constrained. And that kind of
release is a lot of freedom to market and push the product forward and even
open up markets we haven't opened yet. So I think there's a lot of opportunity
here. And I think to, I think, opportunity -- there's opportunity for a number
of things like this, as I mentioned earlier, in what's called the wearables
market, the more affordable and accessible technologies make products like
this, then I think we're going to see a very different market expansion.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning, and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any
participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the
entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed
written permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Ford, President and
Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and
Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian will
discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments,
we'll take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological
and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A,
Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Abbott undertakes no obligation to
release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of
subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that
first quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for
sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations
only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless
otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth,
which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES D. WHITE, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD & CEO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, we announced
results for the first quarter and we're off to another good start. Our sales
growth was strong and right on target, coming in at 7% on an organic basis in
the quarter, and ongoing earnings per share of $0.63 exceeded our previous
guidance range. Our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of
$3.15 to $3.25 remains unchanged and reflects midteens growth at the midpoint
on a constant currency basis. As we've discussed previously, our emphasis today
is on organic execution in the company. Today, all of our businesses have
positive long-term outlooks and are well positioned with excellent products and
attractive markets. At the start of the year, we issued guidance that reflected
another year of strong performance. And for the first quarter, we're right on
track with those expectations. We're particularly pleased with the exceptional
performance of several long-term growth drivers that are leading the way,
including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and the Alinity systems. These
life-changing technologies are positively impacting lives and achieving
impressive results.

I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning
the call over to Brian, and I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales were led
by Core Laboratory growth of 10%. Alinity, our family of next-generation
diagnostic systems, is driving strong growth internationally, and we continue
to achieve significant above-market growth in the United States. In Europe, we
are both converting existing customers to Alinity and winning competitive bids
for new business at a very high rate. We also recently increased our launch
efforts for Alinity h, our hematology system, and obtained CE Mark for Alinity
m, our highly automated Molecular Diagnostics system along with several
infectious disease tests. And we're expanding our menu of tests in key markets
such as China and the United States. With a steady menu expansion on multiple
different instruments across geographies, Alinity will be a significant growth
driver for years to come.

In Nutrition, sales increased more than 6.5% in the quarter,
reflecting strong execution and new product introductions. We continue to see
good underlying market demand and growth, and we're achieving above-market growth
in several geographies, particularly Asia and Latin America. Sales growth this
quarter was balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses with
our core leading brands of Similac, PediaSure and Ensure all contributing to
strong growth overall.

In Established Pharmaceuticals, sales growth of 5.5% was
right in line with our expectations and was a sequential improvement
quarter-to-quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by a 7.5% growth in our
key emerging markets, which represent the most attractive long-term growth
countries for our branded generics portfolio and include India, Brazil, Russia
and China, along with several other emerging countries. Underlying growth
dynamics in these countries continue to remain strong and intact.

And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew
nearly 10%, led by strong double-digit growth in Heart Failure, Structural
Heart, Electrophysiology and Diabetes Care. In Heart Failure, growth of 23% was
led by rapid U.S. market adoption of our HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist
device following FDA approval of a long-term use indication late last year. The
superior patient outcomes demonstrated in the clinical trial that supported
this approval have been a critical component of the growth and the share capture
that we're achieving.

In Structural Heart, several products across our broad
portfolio contributed to strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including
MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation,
a condition caused by a leaky heart valve.

During the quarter, we announced U.S. FDA approval for a new
expanded indication for MitraClip, which significantly expands the number of
people that can be treated. The formal process of seeking Medicare
reimbursement for this new indication has been initiated.

During the quarter, we also filed for CE Mark for our new
triclip device, a first of its kind minimally invasive device for repairing a
leaky tricuspid heart valve. We plan to initiate our U.S. pivotal trial for
triclip in the coming months.

I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where sales grew over 40%
in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose
monitoring system, or CGM. Libre continues to perform exceptionally well with
worldwide sales of $380 million in the quarter, reflecting growth of 80% with
global leadership among CGM systems for both type 1 and type 2 users. In order
to meet the tremendous demand that we're seeing for Libre, we're adding a
significant amount of new manufacturing capacity, which will come online
starting in the second half of this year.

So in summary, we're right on track with our high
expectations to start the year. All of our long-term growth drivers are intact
and achieving significant growth, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and
Alinity. And we're well positioned to achieve the top tier sales and EPS growth
targets that we set at the beginning of the year.

I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results
and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?

BRIAN B. YOOR, EXECUTIVE VP OF FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all
references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic
basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.

Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter
increased 7.1%, and exchange had a negative impact of 4.8% on sales versus the
prior year. Reported sales increased 2% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects
of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.6% of sales, adjusted
R&D investment was 7.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.3% of
sales. All of these ratios were in line with previous guidance.

Turning to our outlook for the full year. We continue to
forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current exchange rates,
we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full
year reported sales, with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in
the first half of the year. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin
ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects
underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We continue to
forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A
expense of around 29.5% of sales for the full year.

Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We forecast
adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.81, which reflects strong double-digit underlying
growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We
forecast organic sales growth of around 7%. And at current rates, we would
expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 4% on our second quarter
reported sales. We forecasted adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59%
of sales, adjusted R&D investment of a little less than 7.5% of sales and
adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. Lastly, we forecast net
interest expense of around $150 million in the second quarter.

Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a
quick overview of our second quarter sales growth outlook by business. For
Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single-digit growth, which is
comprised of mid- to high single-digit growth in our priority key emerging
markets along with a modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects the
recent continuation of a noncore, low-margin supply agreement. In Nutrition, we
forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott's
legacy Diagnostics business, which is comprised of Core Laboratory, Molecular
Point of Care, to grow mid- to high single digits. In Rapid Diagnostics, we
forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth. And in Medical Devices, we
forecast high single-digit sales growth, which reflects continued double-digit
growth in several areas of this business.

With that, we will now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question
comes from Matt Taylor from UBS.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES
& DEVICES, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: So it was encouraging to
see a lot of the big growth drivers here stay on track and really drive healthy
double-digit growth. I was wondering if you could spend some time on each of
those and specifically address Libre. I think a lot of investors are
anticipating Libre 2 and other enhancements that you could make there in
addition to all the capacity you're adding. So can you talk about the pathway
for Libre and some of the other big growth drivers?

MILES D. WHITE: Sure, Matt. Thank you. I think I would say a
couple things first before I focus just on Libre. We're seeing strength across
the board in a lot of device and diagnostic areas. There is a geography here
and there, a product line here and there that we might not be completely
satisfied with. But I think if you look at us, our product areas, even
competitors in various spaces in medical devices, this whole sector is doing
pretty well and the growth rates have improved in a number of cases. I know
that there was a lot preearnings noise out there about the continuity of the
med device sector. I have to say from my perspective, I see nothing but a
strong sector going forward. While we've got great pipelines and great
products, I think the entire sector has a bright future ahead of us here and
the markets are all pretty attractive for us.

So first of all, I think we're in a much healthier
environment than might be reflected right now, and I think a lot of companies
are actually doing really well in that environment. There's a lot of good new
products and pipelines out there. I think the whole thing is pretty healthy.
And then specifically to us, we've got, in our case, I think great pipeline,
great new products and launches in many of the segments and sectors we're in.

To focus on Diabetes Care as a start, that's been a
particular bright spot where, clearly, new technology and affordable technology
has made a very big difference in life for diabetics, both type 1 and type 2
worldwide. Libre has been a pretty powerful leader in that segment on all
accounts and all points. We've been pretty enthused about its success, its
uptake, its reception by patients all over the world. In a fairly short amount
of time, we've achieved global leadership in terms of continuous glucose
monitoring in both type 1 and type 2. I think part of the attraction to
patients is obviously not having the finger stick. The information, the
continuous nature of it, the way it allows diabetics to manage their health and
manage diabetes has been life-changing, and that's been reflective. And I think
very importantly, it's been affordable to a degree that it's really -- it's
become a very broadly accessible technology, which was our intent with it. It's
got a unique ease-of-use and it's got appeal for any kind of patient. So I
think that's pretty important and it's reflected in the reimbursements
worldwide. 80% of sales are now reimbursed internationally over 30 countries.
Well over half of U.S. lives commercially -- commercial lives are covered. So
we're seeing a lot of support for the product in all ways.

We've mentioned a number of times that we've invested
heavily in capacity expansion. That is correct. We put significant investment
into that. And as we've noted a couple of times, the first waves of that come
online in the second half of this year, and then there's a steady cadence of
capacity expansions underway that will come online sequentially after that.
There won't be any constraints to the growth that's possible there. I think it's
going to be a very different kind of device or diagnostic product than we've
seen in the past. Because there are so many of millions of diabetics worldwide,
this is not a niche product, not for type 1s or type 2s. There's not a niche
here. There's a massive population around the world that needs to manage
diabetes, and this product will be broadly accessible to all of them. So it
calls for quite a lot of capacity and in the second half of this year that will
be initiated.

We have a number of things we're expecting and waiting for.
You asked about Libre 2. That is under review at the FDA. We have filed Libre 2
with alarms in the U.S. as an iCGM. We're not going to forecast FDA review time
lines, but we clearly have expectations to achieve that milestone. I'm trying
to think of what else to tell you about that. It's already on the market in
Europe.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR: Maybe just one, that was very
comprehensive, and I'll give you a second to think there. I think the one
follow-up I had was just on Libre 2. You mentioned iCGM. Can you talk about
your confidence in your ability to get that? And I also wanted to ask about the
payer dynamics. Before -- last call, you talked about some preferential
co-pays. Can you talk about any developments that you're seeing on the payer
side in terms of support for Libre?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. I'll tell you what, I'll let our Chief
Operating Officer, who's come from that business, answer that question for you.
Robert?

ROBERT B. FORD, PRESIDENT & COO, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Yes. So on Libre 2, specifically in the U.S., the filing of iCGM, I'll just say
we know what the iCGM standards are. We know what needs to be achieved. And we
filed in the U.S. as an iCGM knowing what the standards need to be achieved. So
we look at what we filed and we look at the standards, and we look at what we
filed and we know that we meet those standards. So to Miles' point, we're not
going to forecast here as to when that approval will come through. But I think
it's clear in terms of what we filed and why we filed.

Regarding payers, specifically in the U.S., I think that
what we've always intended for this product is to remove some of the hurdles,
and affordability was one of those. And if you look at a lot of the evolution
of the reimbursement here in the U.S. that's slowly moving from something that
was -- with a lot of prior authorizations, only going through mail order to now
looking very much like the blood glucose monitoring market where we start to
see less prior authorizations, formulary positions that are allowing patients
to go to a pharmacy and pick that up. So a lot of our managed care strategy was
focused on driving that shift, and a key part of that is the access and
affordability. So we're seeing that in our managed care coverage. As Miles said,
we're over 50% now of managed care life coverage in this patient population.
And you see the shift into pharmacy. If you look at the script data, total
Rxes, you can see that shift. You can see that occurring with Libre. And that
was a very intentional strategy to accelerate adoption, specifically in the
U.S., by going to pharmacy, which is something that hadn't been done before
with CGM systems. And we did that, and we're starting to kind of move that
category into the pharmacy.

MILES D. WHITE: Matt, I know you guys like that. You can
track publicly. You can track that every week. And we've been pretty pleased
with the performance going through pharmacy. The patient acquisition and so
forth continues to be obviously strong, frankly, right in line with our growth
rates around the world, as you'd expect, because we're not trying to drive
price here. We're trying to drive the volume and acquisition of patients. And
obviously, that's going pretty strongly. So there's nothing but happiness about
this product. I can tell you, we're pretty happy with it. It's doing really
well. I actually think we're kind of in its early stages. And at this point,
there's over 1 million type 1 users of Libre around the world and those only
make up 2/3 of our user base. So with this kind of a growth rate, that kind of
a user base with the capacity expansion coming online, we're obviously
expecting this to be a continuingly big and bigger product for us.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from David Lewis from
Morgan Stanley.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Just a couple questions for me. One, more broadly for Miles and maybe a quick
follow-up. Miles, I just wonder if you can kind of share with us how you see
sort of the pacing of the year from here. I think in the fourth quarter, the
messaging was core growth drivers very much intact, some one-off dynamics were
suppressing growth and you expected that growth to improve in the first
quarter. And sure enough, that's sort of what happened here, back in sort of the
7% range. As you think about the balance of the year, you had these core growth
drivers doing relatively well, a couple of businesses probably not performing
where you'd like to perform. So how do we think about the pacing of the
business from the first quarter on given some of these very solid businesses
and some of the businesses that are not performing as you'd like?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, a couple of sort of baseline comments
there. Every year, we're going to the year and the gating of earnings per share
for any given quarter tends to start out lower at the front end of the year and
it always looks back-end loaded and -- toward the third and fourth quarters.
I'd say, increasingly, that's leveling a little bit in that it's still a climb
as the year goes on. But in our case, it's reflecting growth and penetration of
new products. And there's a couple of seasonalities in there, but they're not
big enough to really affect the overall earnings profile. We've increasingly
seen stronger and stronger first quarters. But to be honest, third and fourth
is always strong, but it's driven right now by the incredible growth of
Alinity, Libre, HeartMate, MitraClip. There's so much real growth in the new
products that are launching that it just gets better and better as the year
rolls on. So I think it's always hard to gate to the penny. We try to get our
estimates to a point like that. Then we're always subject to a couple of lumpy
comparisons to whatever happened last year and so on, I guess, because it looks
optically weird when it's bumpy. But the fact is the growth is steady. As you
said, it's not only intact, it's strong. But there are a couple of places you
could poke and say, "Okay, you must not be satisfied with that." And
I'd say, "Yes, you're right about that."

But while we've got some places we're putting a lot of more
focus on and we've obviously miscalled the pace of improvement, I'd say, in
general, I'm glad that what we have to work on for improvement is where it is
and not in these major growth drivers. So Alinity is performing strongly. We
are winning over 95% of accounts where we already have the business, and we're
winning almost 2/3 of the accounts where we're head-to-head with an entrenched
competitor. That's pretty powerful data when you consider that customers have
to switch out mainframe systems. It's a big commitment. It takes months. There
are long-term contracts. So -- but winning almost 2/3 of those new business,
new accounts, that's pretty significant. That's a pretty powerful endorsement
by the market of the Alinity systems and the laboratory solutions we're
offering. We're seeing improvement in growth just about every place.

I'm really pleased with Nutrition. I had to sit here on this
call a number of times and explain, well, we're expecting it to get a little
better. But it's performing really well and I think consistently so across all
geographies and across both major product lines there. That's been a nice
story. And we've estimated to you that the growth rate of that business going
forward we will look for in the 4% to 6% range. And obviously, we're a little
beyond that. I don't know that we're going to constantly be beyond that. But
that 4% to 6% range is all good. So anywhere in there is pretty good for us.
There does tend to be some up and down with it in some countries depending on
holidays and seasons and so forth. But overall, if we're not watching it week
to week, that's a pretty strong business right now and we like what we see. The
management has done a great job worldwide.

So as far as quarters coming, I'm hard-pressed to find a lot
of things to point at as watchouts other than, as you pointed out, we got a
couple of places where we think we've got work to do and to improve the
performance of the business. I'm pleased that we can show that we know how to
correct the performance of an underperforming business. But as you would
probably rightly point out to me right now, there's a couple that are taking
longer than I might have guessed.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Okay. Miles, very helpful as we think
about the balance of the year. So I guess my follow-up would just be the other
major growth driver investors are focused on is MitraClip. So by our math, it
looks like the U.S. business accelerated for MitraClip even before the NCD. And
I wonder if you could just sort of, A, talk about your time at the NCD, what
you're seeing in the U.S. And then we had this other study, MITRA-FR, in the
European business and our sense on diligence is that's maybe suppressing some
performance ex U.S. So maybe time of the NCD, U.S. trends and sort of what
you're seeing ex U.S. and outlook for the year.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. I'm going to have Robert take that.

ROBERT B. FORD: Okay. So yes, we had a very good quarter in
Structural Heart, and we showed growth across many of our different franchises
and geographies. Obviously, MitraClip was a big driver and we're right where we
wanted to be with MitraClip. The FDA approval was a few months ahead. But I
think that speaks to the data and the evidence that was generated through
COAPT. Label is very much in line with our expectations and reflects the COAPT
patient enrollment criteria. So we're now obviously working on CMS. Process is
underway. These usually take between 6 to 9 months. If you look at our
experience when we achieved the primary MR reimbursement indication a few years
back, that took us about 7.5 months from when we started to when we got it
approved. So we know how to do this. We're currently in the process. And it'll
just be a little bit difficult to forecast here, but we're very optimistic. But
I'd say reimbursement is only one of the building blocks. It's definitely an
important building block, but it's not the only one to really think about this
business as a multiyear, double-digit kind of growth driver for us.

There are other building blocks here that are very important
that we're currently already underway. Opening of new centers is a key aspect
here, and the timing and the framework and the cycle of how we do that is
important. We have currently about 350 implanting centers in the U.S. And I
think over the next few years, we'll see that number get to about 550. There's
a lot of training that's involved here also, sales force training, center
training, implanter training. And if you look at a sales rep, it'll usually
take them between 6 to 9 months until they get fully proficient on MitraClip.
So -- and then there's obviously the development, support and sustaining of a
patient referral network as we build awareness of the therapy and the
technology amongst the physician groups and ensure that those got funneled into
our implant centers. So those are some of the key blocks.

But I'd say we know how to do this. We've been doing it in
the U.S. for the last 4 years and we're not going to wait for final CMS
approval before we start hiring. We're already hiring more reps. We're
expanding our sales force. We're expanding our clinical specialists so that
we're going to be ready to go. So we're definitely taking an invest ahead
approach here. So I like our position. The mitral is a tremendous opportunity,
unmet need and an opportunity for Abbott. And quite frankly, we've been -- this
position didn't happen just because of COAPT. We've been building this position
for over a decade. So whether it's mitral repair or mitral repayment, we're in
a pretty unique position. So I do see kind of sequential growth as we go
through the year.

Your question on MITRA-FR, yes, we did see that impact some
of our European markets. And we know it's a French study, so it did have a
little bit of an impact on some of the kind of implanting rates in some key
European markets. But I think that's more of a transition thing. I don't think
that's a fundamental change in the market in Europe. And we had expanded
internationally to other large opportunities. Japan is another market where we
see a very large opportunity for us. So that is also going to help kind of
drive the growth. I think the Mitra-FR study will take another quarter or so to
play out, but I -- we do expect the international business to kind of continue
its growth.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank
of America.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFA MERRILL
LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just have 2 pretty direct questions here. One more to
focus on the growth drivers. On Alinity, a question on the U.S. launch. When do
you think we'll see the full impact of that launch in the U.S.? When does that
really show up in results in a meaningful way?

MILES D. WHITE: Bob, I'd say show up, we expect to get the
almost full menu by the end of this year. Now that's kind of a running thing
and we don't want to put a whole lot of effort out until we've got significant
menu. We do have significant menu now, but we'd like to get more of it approved
and then go. So I think you'll start to see the U.S. show up in the numbers
really in 2020 because even if we were launching now, I think you'd be
hard-pressed to see it relative to the size of the business worldwide. We're
growing at 9% right now in the U.S. without much emphasis on Alinity. So I'd
say you're probably going to see a measurable impact from it in 2020. But
frankly, right now in the U.S., growth rate is pretty high even while we expand
that menu.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS: Okay. And then the other question I
just wanted to ask, obviously, you've got a lot of growth drivers that are
driving really strong results in devices overall. One thing that's been a
little weak is on the neuromod side the last couple of quarters. So I guess my
question on neuromod is, do you think the weakness in the U.S. is related to a
slower market at all? Or are these Abbott-specific issues? And when do you
think we could expect a turn?

MILES D. WHITE: A good question. I kind of anticipated this
one. This is the one where I'm going to fall on my own sword for how fast I
forecast the turn here for us. Okay, there's clearly an Abbott issue here, our
own management, which I've said before. And I think we, I in particular, have
miscalled the pace at which we would turn our own performance. And where we underestimated
that was we're expanding our sales force by 40% to 50%, and that's been a
little more disruptive than I think we had expected. But I'm confident in the
business. I'm confident in the management. I'm confident in the direction we're
headed. I clearly wasn't right about the timing. So I'm not worrying about it
from the standpoint of, boy, this business is really broken or hurt. It's not.
And so I have a lot of confidence about that.

As far as growth goes, I don't think that it's a high
double-digit grower, but it's a double-digit grower. And I think in med devices
and in some of these markets as it becomes established, to be maintaining a
double-digit growth rate as a market segment, I think, is pretty healthy. So I
haven't -- we're not losing any confidence in the segments or the potential in
the segments or the growth in the segments. I put the growth sort of in that
double-digit range. That's what we would expect. And it's not 50%, but it's not
5% either. So our performance in this particular segment is clearly
underperforming what it should be. So I'd say if you want to know if the market
is slowing, well, it's not 50%. But slow is a relative thing. I'd take any
double-digit market, and I think this is a healthy market.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from
Wells Fargo.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO
SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Miles, a couple of product-related
questions starting with Rhythm Management and Heart Failure. U.S. Rhythm
Management was a little soft. Was that market-related or Abbott-specific? And I
understand you made some management changes there. How quickly can you turn
that around? And secondly, in Heart Failure, that was obviously very strong.
Could you talk about the sustainability of that? And I had one follow-up.

MILES D. WHITE: Thank you. I could talk about that, but I'm
going to hand it to Robert to talk about.

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes, so in our Electrophysiology business,
Larry, we definitely had a lower kind of growth rate in the U.S. of about 6%
when international grew 20%. And that was -- that's -- it's not a market thing.
That's more of an Abbott as we get ready to launch -- as we're launching our
new ablation catheter, TactiCath SE, in the U.S., which we have already
launched OUS. We obviously saw some kind of inventory depletion of the older
product in getting ready for the new product. So we expect that to get back to
the double-digit growth rate in the U.S. on the EP side. On CRM, that is
definitely another area of disappointment and obviously, focus for us. We
showed some recovery in the international markets, and I think the team there
has done a good job at execution. But we're obviously not satisfied with our
U.S. performance. It's an important business for us and we got to do better.
But what we've seen internationally is where we've deployed dedicated EP and
CRM teams, the business does better. It does better in CRM. And quite frankly,
it does better in EP. So we -- as you saw, we recently made some organizational
changes here to sharpen our focus and create a more, I'd say, stand-alone
vertical business unit in CRM. We think that's going to get the accountability
and the focus that we need out in the commercial field, especially in the U.S.
And we've got several new product innovations that are progressing very nicely.
Our next-gen ICD and our 2 leadless programs. And now this structure will
ensure that they get the focus that they need.

In Heart Failure, as you mentioned, our sales were up 23%.
U.S. was up 26%, and that was the impact of, I'd say, the rapid share capture
that we achieved in the U.S. in the destination therapy, I'd say, a pretty
strong execution of the commercial team with the product, achieving about 20
share points in that quarter. So we expect that share to kind of maintain. The
product has done very well, not only on our, I'd say, traditional Abbott
accounts, but even in our competitor accounts, that's doing very nicely also.
So we look -- we think Heart Failure has got strong potential also throughout the
year with CardioMEMS. It's a little bit smaller product here, but it also
continues to do very well.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN: That's very helpful. And just lastly
for me, Miles, as you pay down more debt, we're starting to get more questions
on capital allocation. Can you please provide us with your latest thoughts,
especially as it relates to M&A? When can we expect to see a pickup in
M&A?

MILES D. WHITE: You're welcome. Well, a couple of things.
First of all, I think the company has done a great job of paying down debt,
cash management, cash generation, et cetera. It's been a little unprecedented,
I think, for as much debt as we had. I mean, when we were done with the St.
Jude and Alere acquisitions, I think we were at about $28 billion, something
like that. We've paid down more $10 billion of that. So -- and almost $8.5
billion of it just last year. Another $0.5 billion in the first quarter this
year. So our debt -- everybody watches net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We're down to
about 2x right now from what was, I think, about 4.3 when we completed the
second of the 2 acquisitions. That's a pretty rapid paydown. We expect to be
about 1.5x by year-end. So I think I could declare strategic flexibility
achieved. Obviously, we want to keep paying down the debt. We've got nice,
strong cash flow. We've got a number of choices. We increased the dividend, as
you know, back in December by 14%. And we tend to target that dividend at
around 40% to 45% of EPS. And I think right now, we're at 40%, something like
that. EPS is growing pretty rapidly, so probably be adjusting at some point.
But the -- there's good times and bad times to purchase shares, as you know.
And our share repurchases, we haven't done a lot of share repurchasing. We've
done some primarily just to offset dilution, but that has not been a big
consumer of capital.

We have made significant investments internally in our
growth with Alinity expansion and with the Libre capacity expansion. And again,
while those are important users of our capital with high return, we still have
pretty strong cash flow. So back to the point of your question, we have
strategic flexibility. We have strong cash flow. We have choice. The -- I think
the question is whether or not at any point there's something out there that
fits us or we're particularly interested in or that we're focused on, et
cetera. And as you know, I've told you in the past, even if I have that, I
wouldn't tell you, that would be true. I would say today, what is also true is
we are very much focused on our internal organic execution, and that's getting
sort of 95% of our attention. We're not paying attention to other
opportunities. We always are tracking and monitoring other opportunities. But I
have to tell you right now, I don't see a very robust target-rich environment
out there. It's not target-rich. I don't think it is anyway. And I don't see a
lot of meaningful adjunctive things that necessarily fit what we're trying to
do.

So obviously, as we move forward here, one of our challenges
is going to be capital deployment because we're going to have a lot of it. And
I think we're going to generate a lot of cash over the coming years. I think
we're going to generate a lot of profit. And we obviously want to either invest
at or return it to shareholders at the highest possible return. And if it means
there's opportunities in M&A, as you know, historically, we've always been
pretty attentive and diligent about that. I wouldn't forecast it when or what.
We -- but we are out of the range where we're constrained about our choices. We
are no longer constrained. And I think that's a positive. We've gotten there
pretty quickly. And that means that we can consider whatever. We don't happen
to be focused on M&A right now, but M&A isn't a steady every year
thing. It's opportunistic when it fits the strategy and the intent of the
company and when an opportunity fits and a return can be earned. And so if
something like that comes along, I'd say we're well positioned. We'd be ready
to do something. But to be honest, we haven't seen something that attractive.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from
Evercore ISI.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR, MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL
EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: Congrats on a nice start to the year and thanks
for taking my question. So maybe I'll start one on the guidance, and I have a
follow-up. On the guidance, Miles, MitraClip approval came in earlier. I know
in the last call you said you're not expecting any inflection in MitraClip, but
it looks like there might be some contribution in the back half. And I think FX
assumptions changed modestly. It's slightly better. We had a I/IIb. Nutrition
coming in better. I'm just curious on the guidance not being tweaked or
changed. I know it's not your style, but I'm just curious on your guidance for
the year.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes, Vijay, thanks for the question. You
kind of answered it at the end of your question there when you said it's not my
style. I rarely, if ever, raise in a first quarter. I kind of feel like if I
raised in the first quarter, why didn't I put it in the original plan 3 months
ago or 6 months ago? But I have generally waited to consider such a thing in
the mid-year because at various points in time, well, there's been a number of
times we've all been burned by exchange around April, May, June or something
for the remainder of the year. I don't actually expect that this year. I'm no
forecaster of exchange and we're not currency traders, as you know. But just
based on what we all see, we were all -- like all industries, all companies,
all multinationals and so forth, we were all cautious about China trade and
exchange and volatility, the price of oil, even Brexit. These were sort of the
big factors everybody talked about. Oil is almost $70, and I don't think Brexit
is weighing on a lot of minds. It's weighing on a lot of European minds, it's
weighing on a lot of U.K. minds and it depends on how much business you got
tied up in the U.K. But companies have had time to figure out how to mitigate a
lot of these things and deal with them. So I'd say the reason that we didn't
look at raising in the first quarter is because I just don't raise in the first
quarter.

We're obviously off to a strong start. As I told you before,
all of our growth story is solid and intact, not seeing any -- gosh, I feel
like I should knock on wood. I'm not seeing any threats to the growth vehicles
in the business. And while some analysts have speculated that med tech or med
devices is somewhat slowing, I'd tell you, I don't see that. And I don't think
a lot of other CEOs in medical devices are seeing it either. In fact, if
anything, I see projected growth rates rising across competitors. I take that
as a very healthy signal from the industry that people are seeing positive,
robust opportunity. I think a lot of people have new products and robust
pipelines. And I think that's healthy for the whole sector worldwide. There's a
lot of things that haven't changed, but we've been navigating those kinds of
things for a while and doing well as an industry and as a company.

So could we have raised in the first quarter? Well, a lot of
you may think so. I'm a little more cautious than that. I always kind of wait
until the midyear so -- to kind of assess things. I like how the company is
performing. I think the company is performing really well. I'm not sure we've
ever had such healthy pipeline so broadly across the line in the company. So I
don't have any negatives. I'm just thinking that one quarter into the year
seems a little early to me. That's about as much as I can tell, that's a honest
answer.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR: That's fair enough, Miles. And so
this is -- whatever it is, it's the macro, it's not the fundamental. I guess
related to that, I guess, the question we're getting a lot and not maybe just
specific to Abbott, but the sector, is the sector, the fundamentals that we're
seeing, is this sustainable? And I think specific to Abbott, Libre -- can Libre
be a north of $5 billion product for you guys longer term? And the reason I ask
is sustainability. I think you guys gave some numbers on MitraClip in terms of
TAM. Libre, I think you've kind of left it open ended saying it's a
multibillion-dollar product. And I'm just curious whether the Libre 2 that was
submitted to the FDA, is that the same product as the Libre 2 in Europe? Or was
the algorithm changed for the U.S. submission?

ROBERT B. FORD: It's a similar product. Vijay, this is
Robert. It's a similar product. It's just got a different label.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR: And on the TAM for Libre, can this be
north of $5 billion for you guys longer term?

ROBERT B. FORD: Listen, we've always thought of this as a --
I mean, if you look at the amount of diabetic patients in the world where this
technology tends to have a greater impact, it tends to have a greater impact
with insulin users, right? Whether you're a type 1 or a type 2 on a
conventional kind of injection therapy, and there are 40 million of them around
the world. 20 million of them in emerging markets and the other half in
developed markets. So we think this is, as we said, a multibillion-dollar
opportunity. Whether it's $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion, $5 billion, I
mean, you can look at these patient segments and patient numbers and it's very
big, so yes.

MILES D. WHITE: Vijay, I'd add a couple of things to that.
We're investing in capacity expansion accordingly. But there's sort of more to
the story. As you know, there's a Libre 2 in Europe. There's a Libre 2 under
review in the United States. There's a Libre 3 in development and has been in
development for some time. And there's a lot of potential for expansion of this
product to other analytes besides glucose or additional analytes to glucose for
the diabetic. There are other improvements that we can make in the product. All
of that is in development. We know this platform well. It is a platform. It is
not just a glucose test kit. And so there's, I guess, what I'll call an R&D
development innovation strategy with it that is underway, has been underway.
Our capacity expansion plans are well planned. We've already got almost 1.5
million users of Libre. And to be honest, we haven't exactly let the floodgates
go. So I think you can kind of back into the math of that. This product is
already great. Look, it's probably $1.5 billion or more in sales more and it's
growing at 80%. So it doesn't take very long to figure out the math to what you
just asked.

OPERATOR: And our final question comes from Chris Pasquale
from Guggenheim.

CHRISTOPHER THOMAS PASQUALE, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR ANALYST,
GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Miles, one follow-up on Bob's
neuro question. We've seen new product launches drive momentum for a number of
companies in that market over the past couple of years. You guys really haven't
talked much about your pipeline there. Are there new products coming that could
help turn that segment around? Or is it really just a matter of letting the
dust settle on the sales force expansion?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I'd say it's kind of like when you've
got some issues with your own commercial execution and your sales force and you
know you got to go fix them, it's kind of like ducking the question to go talk
about your pipeline. So my own thought has been let's just address the sales
force answer and not try to dodge and weave here about our own execution, which
we admit we can do better and we're going to do better. Now having said that,
yes, is there a pipeline in development? Robert?

ROBERT B. FORD: Yes. So to that point, we also know that our
first and foremost priority is the field execution. We also know that
innovation and evidence also has an impact on our ability to kind of grow. So
we've doubled our R&D investment in this business since taking it over
about 2 years ago. And I do expect to see 2 new systems in the pain area come
to market towards the end of this year or beginning of next year, and I think
that will have a positive impact, obviously, ensuring that our sales force is
getting up to speed and doing what it needs to do. Evidence is also another
important driver here. So we do have trials that we're investing and working on
for differentiated claims, whether it's pelvic pain or a pre-back surgery kind
of claim. So your point of, yes, we are investing, we have to make sure we
address the field force, but we do have a pipeline here that we know we're
going to need to be able to have a sustainable double-digit growth business.

CHRISTOPHER THOMAS PASQUALE: That's helpful. And then my
last one, just Structural Heart, already a bright spot for the company today
and feels like it has the potential to get even better as the pipeline there
matures. Can you just go through the latest thinking on Tendyne in Europe,
which we should be getting relatively close to here, and then also Portico in
the U.S.?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. So I think that's one bright area in
the device portfolio. We've made a lot of investments here. We talked a little
bit about triclip that we should see towards the end of this year. Tendyne, to
your point, we filed it last year for CE Mark. So we're also right now on
target to see that come to market at the end of this year. We've got a
fourth-generation MitraClip product that will be coming more towards the second
half of this year also. So we're excited about that. And TAVR, we expect to see
that in the U.S. -- Portico in the U.S. in the first half of next year.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER: Okay. Well, good. Thank you,

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning, and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any
participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the
entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written
permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White,
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive
Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.

Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian will discuss
our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles,
Brian and I will take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological
and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A,
Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any
revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or
developments except as required by law. Please note that fourth quarter
financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and
line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless
otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth,
which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES D. WHITE, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD & CEO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, I'll discuss our 2018
results as well as our outlook for 2019. For the full year 2018, we achieved
ongoing earnings per share of $2.88, representing 15% growth versus the prior
year. Strong performance across our businesses, along with underlying margin
expansion and our synergy capture from recent acquisitions, enabled us to achieve
EPS at the upper end of the initial guidance range we issued at the beginning
of last year despite unfavorable currency shifts as we progressed through the
year.

With our recent strategic shaping completed, our focus in
2018 was on running the company we've built, and the result was an excellent
year by every measure. All 4 of our major businesses performed well,
contributing to overall organic sales growth of more than 7%, which is above
the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of last year. At the same
time, we generated operating cash flow of more than $6 billion, returning $2
billion to shareholders in the form of dividends, and announced a 14% increase
in our dividend beginning this year.

We also increased our investments in capabilities for the
future, including expanding manufacturing capacity in 2 important areas that
will drive significant long-term growth: FreeStyle Libre, our revolutionary
continuous glucose monitoring system; and Alinity, our family of highly
differentiated diagnostic systems.

And lastly, following 2 major acquisitions in 2017, we
repaid more than $8 billion of debt, which significantly enhances our strategic
flexibility going forward.

Our performance this past year demonstrates the strength of
our strategy and execution. And for 2019, we're forecasting another year of
strong financial performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast organic
sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25,
reflecting double-digit growth.

I'll now provide a brief overview of our 2018 results and
2019 outlook for each business. I'll start with Nutrition, where sales
increased mid-single digits in 2018, reflecting a notable improvement in our
growth rate versus the prior year. Sales growth this past year was well
balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses.

Internationally, our focus on enhancing competitiveness with
our well-known and trusted brands led to strong growth in both Asia and Latin
America. In China, we saw improvement in both the market and our performance
after the government transitioned to new food safety regulations in that
country at the beginning of last year.

And in the U.S., growth was driven by our Pediatric
Nutrition business, led by above-market growth of Similac, our market-leading
infant formula brand; and Pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand.
Overall, the fundamental demographic and socioeconomic trends in the global
nutrition market remain favorable, and our position in the market remains very
competitive.

In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales grew 7% in
2018, led by double-digit growth in both India and China. Our strategy in EPD
is unique and quite simple: to build significant presence, scale and leadership
positions in the most attractive emerging markets where long-term growth in
medicines will be driven by aging populations and the related rise in chronic
diseases, increasing incomes and expanding access to care.

We've built our business over time through a series of
strategic steps to be powered globally but driven locally. Our global scale
sets us apart and provides a unique competitive advantage versus local players,
particularly when it comes to manufacturing and innovation. And our local
decision-making allows us to be nimble and navigate the complexities of each
country. Health care spending in most emerging markets is less than half that
of developed markets, which means there's lots of room for future growth. And
our focus continues to be on strong execution across all elements of our
business model to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead.

Moving to Diagnostics, where we've consistently achieved
above-market growth with our leading platforms. 2018 was no different with
global organic sales growth of 7%. This past year was particularly important as
we accelerated the launch of Alinity, our family of highly differentiated
instruments in Europe and other international markets. Customer feedback has
been outstanding, which, quite frankly, isn't a surprise to us given that
Alinity was designed based on countless hours of listening to and observing the
needs of our customers. These systems are designed to be more efficient,
running more tests in less space, generating results faster, minimizing human
errors while continuing to provide quality results. In 2019, while the
international launch continues to gain momentum, we anticipate obtaining U.S.
regulatory approvals for a critical mass of our test menu over the coming
months, which will allow us to accelerate the launch of Alinity in the U.S.
later this year.

2018 was also an important year for our newly formed Rapid
Diagnostics business. We achieved our sales and synergy targets for the year
and are very pleased with the pace and progress of the integration of this
business. We also made important advancements in our pipeline with new product
launches in the areas of diabetes and cardiac care as well as molecular rapid
tests for infectious diseases. These new products, along with continued focus
on strong execution across our portfolio, will drive accelerated growth for
this business going forward.

And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 9%
in 2018, exceeding the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of the
year. Strong growth this past year was led by several areas, including
Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care, as well as stabilization
in our Rhythm Management and Vascular businesses.

In Electrophysiology, growth of 20% was led by our heart
mapping and ablation portfolio. During the year, we advanced our product
portfolio in this area with the launch of our Advisor HD Catheter, which
creates highly detailed maps of the heart. And earlier this week, we announced
U.S. FDA approval of our innovative TactiCath Sensor Enabled Catheter, which
will further strengthen our competitiveness in this highly underpenetrated
market.

In Structural Heart, 2018 was a landmark year for our
business. We achieved double-digit growth and, perhaps more importantly,
announced clinical trial results for MitraClip, our market-leading device for
the minimally invasive repair of the mitral valve, which demonstrated improved
survival and clinical outcomes in patients with the most prevalent form of this
heart disease. We submitted this study data to the U.S. FDA during the fourth
quarter to support consideration of an expanded indication for MitraClip. If
approved, this advancement would further enhance our leadership position in
this large and highly underpenetrated disease area and offer the potential to
create a new multibillion-dollar cardiac device market over time.

And lastly, in Diabetes Care, we achieved growth of 35% in
2018. Growth was led by FreeStyle Libre, which achieved global sales of more
than $1 billion, an increase of 100% versus the prior year. During the fourth
quarter, we added 300,000 new users. As of the end of 2018, there are now
approximately 1.3 million active users worldwide, of which approximately 2/3
are type 1 diabetics and 1/3 are type 2.

In the U.S., we saw an accelerating trend of new users as we
ramped up our awareness efforts during the second half of the year, and
pharmacy insurance coverage continued to increase, including an emerging trend
of seeing Libre granted preferred copay status versus competitive systems due
to its compelling overall value proposition.

In Europe, during the fourth quarter, we initiated the
launch of Libre 2.0, which includes optional alarms that warn patients if
glucose levels fallout range. Due to our unique product design and a highly
automated manufacturing process, we're able to offer this feature to Libre
users without increasing the cash pay price. This affordable and simple-to-use
device is fundamentally changing the way people with diabetes manage their
disease. And given the fact that more than 400 million people are living with
diabetes around the world, Libre promises to be a significant growth driver for
years to come.

So in summary, 2018 was another outstanding year for us. We
achieved our strategic and financial objectives despite challenging currency shifts
during the year. Our top-tier performance demonstrates the strength of our
strategy, our portfolio and our execution. And for 2019, we're forecasting
continued strong organic sales growth and double-digit EPS growth.

I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2018
results and our 2019 outlook in a bit more detail. Brian?

BRIAN B. YOOR, EXECUTIVE VP OF FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all
references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic
basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.

Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter
increased 6.4% on an organic basis, in line with our guidance of mid- to high
single-digit growth. Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired in late 2017 and is
therefore not included in our 2018 organic sales growth results, achieved sales
of $548 million. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.7% on
fourth quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to
strengthen modestly, resulting in a somewhat larger unfavorable impact on our
results in the fourth quarter compared to expectations had exchange rates held
steady since the time of our earnings call in October.

Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross
margin ratio was 59.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.2% of sales,
and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.2% of sales.

Overall, as we look back at 2018, we delivered strong
organic sales growth of more than 7%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 15%
and exceeded our cash flow and debt repayment objectives.

Turning to our outlook for the full year 2019. Today, we
issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25. For the full
year, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current rates,
we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on
our full year reported sales, with the vast majority of the impact expected to
occur in the first half of the year.

We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above
59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin
improvement across our businesses, partially offset by the impact of currency.
We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted
SG&A expense of approximately 29.5% of sales. We forecast net interest
expense of around $600 million and nonoperating income of around $200 million.

Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 15% for
the full year 2019, which contemplates the anticipated impact from U.S. tax
reform.

Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We forecast
adjusted EPS of $0.60 to $0.62, which reflects strong double-digit underlying
growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We
forecast organic sales growth of a little less than 7%, which contemplates a
difficult comparison versus the first quarter of last year, when we saw
abnormally strong sales in our Rapid Diagnostics business due to a record flu
season. At current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of
around 5.5% on our first quarter reported sales.

We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 58.5%
of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted
SG&A expense of somewhat above 32% of sales.

Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a
quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook
by business.

For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast
mid-single-digit growth in the first quarter, which is comprised of mid- to
high single-digit growth in our priority key emerging markets, along with a
modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects the recent discontinuation of
a noncore low-margin third-party supply agreement. For the full year, we
forecast Established Pharmaceuticals growth of mid- to high-single digits.

In Nutrition, we forecast low- to mid-single-digit growth
for both the first quarter and the full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast
Abbott's legacy Diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of Core Laboratory,
Molecular and Point of Care, to grow mid- to high-single digits for both the
first quarter and full year, driven by the continued strong sales momentum
across our portfolio of instruments.

Rapid Diagnostics, which will now be included in our organic
sales growth results in 2019, is expected to be relatively flat in the first
quarter, reflecting the difficult flu season comparison I mentioned earlier.
For the full year, we forecast Rapid Diagnostics growth of low- to mid-single
digits.

And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales
growth for both the first quarter and the full year, which reflects continued
double-digit growth in several areas of the business.

With that, we will now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question
will come from Matt Taylor from UBS.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST OF MEDICAL
SUPPLIES & DEVICES, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Wanted to ask
about FreeStyle Libre to start off. You had another good quarter of patient
adds, and it seems like you're expanding more into type 2 with the new
disclosure. Could you talk about the trends there, what's the 2.0 adds and some
of your longer-term vision for Libre?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes, sure, Matt. Well, a few things about
Libre -- or actually several things about Libre. First of all, it's going
extremely well. We did add 300,000 patients last quarter. That's almost
equivalent to the entire user base of the #2 competitor in the space. So I'd
say that's going very well. We got over 1.3 million patients now. 2/3 of those
are type 1. Our intent with this device has been to serve the entire diabetic
community and not niche it because we think it has mass-market potential
worldwide. So we target both segments, both type 1 and type 2. And we're doing
very well in type 1 segment -- the type 1 segment actually. And as our capacity
expands, we'll put even more effort behind the expansion with type 2 patients.
There's a constant, I'll say, cadence of enhancements, et cetera, to the
product. We've recently launched 2.0 in Europe. That should come to the U.S.
shortly. We're -- we've obviously invested a fair bit in capacity expansion.
And at the rate we're adding patients, obviously, that's something we started
paying attention to a couple of years ago. And I'd say, a significant quantum
of capacity will come online in the second half of this year. And from my
perspective, that allows us to open the floodgate much wider. At this point,
we're having a tremendous amount of success with Libre without putting much
push behind it. And at that point, we're going to have an ability to turn on a
lot of push. So -- and then we've got steady cadence of capacity additions after
that. And because of the magnitude and the size of the diabetic market, both
for type 1 diabetics and type 2 diabetics, our view was this had to have a
value proposition for patients and for the health care system that was
accessible and affordable by everybody and not just driven by a rebate system
and so forth. So we've got a very low cost position. We've got a good value
access price point. And I think all of that is playing through our markets and
our patient groups and influence groups and so forth very well. The product
obviously is getting all the emphasis in development, et cetera, that anybody
would like to see. I think this is a very big, long-term, sustainable growth
product for the company. I don't have any other way to say it. This is a happy,
happy topic.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR: Yes, it's been phenomenal growth. I
was just curious, as you look forward in segmenting the market, you now have
Libre 2 with alarms. You have partnership with a pump company. Can you talk
about how you might bifurcate your strategy to go after different segments,
whether you need low-cost offering and a higher feature offering as you kind of
expand through the Libre portfolio?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I think -- I'm going to be careful how
much I say publicly on the phone. I think you can assume that we're obviously
developing every aspect of this product that you can imagine. And that's all
going very well. I wouldn't communicate what I would forecast as time lines. I
think that the current growth rate speaks for itself. The current submissions
and features of the product that we're adding speak for themselves. We're
pretty highly focused on bringing that capacity online, and not because we're
constrained yet, but right now, we're adding as, I said, 300,000 patients a quarter
and growing. And so you have to pay attention to keeping that momentum
increasing. And at this point, with that many patients and the magnitude of the
opportunity, our intent is to make this very much a mass-market product. But
with 40 million type 1 diabetics out there, mass market means every one of
those type 1 diabetics ought to be able to access this product economically,
and that's worldwide. And then of course, there's an enormous type 2 market
beyond that. So this is not a product that's targeted solely at type 1 or
solely at type 2. Its accuracy and performance obviously has meaning and
efficacy in all segments. Our low -- our cost position is as low as anything in
the industry. We have probably #1 cost position, #1 volume of patients position.
I think we can pretty easily declare ourselves the leader in continuous glucose
monitoring and growing faster than everybody else. So I'd just say that all of
the things that you would expect us to be doing, including working with other
third-party partners who would benefit from this technology, all underway, have
been for some time.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus
from JPMorgan.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Miles, maybe I can ask a guidance question. So Abbott's
guidance for 2019 is 6.5% to 7.5%, basically in line with 2018 and a bit better
than The Street was expecting to start the year. So maybe you could give us a
little background what your confidence is at the starting point? And maybe
specifically, touch on some of the key growth drivers for 2019 that people are
focused on. MitraClip, you talked about Libre, and maybe hit on an Alinity.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. Well, I think you've touched base there
on several of them already. What you should read into that guidance is we had
an outstanding '18 and we just gave you guidance that's even better than '18.
And the underlying growth rates are strong. The pipelines are strong. It's all
organic growth. It's not dependent on lapping an acquisition. It's not driven
by lapping an acquisition. It's not dependent on acquiring something. And all
the things that are driving our growth are coming right out of our own pipeline
and launching globally. So if I take that a piece at a time, Libre as a story
just gets better and better and better. So obviously, that's a pretty big and
high-growth driver. That's a good thing. The Alinity program has had an
outstanding year rolling out in the Core Lab, which is primarily driven by
Europe. And we haven't really unleashed it yet fully in the U.S. or even fully
in Asian markets. And as that menu reaches what I'll call critical mass, that
will tip up as well. And so far, everything we've seen with the rollout in
Europe has been exceptional. Our share capture, our retention of rolling over a
lot of our own customers and our own installed base, our price point and value
point were, I'd say, extremely competitive, but it's better than that. And so
that's going well, and that momentum only gets better as we expand geographies.
And frankly, there's a couple of aspects to that program that haven't really
gone to market yet fully, our hematology piece, et cetera. So I think those are
strong drivers. When we acquired Alere in the diagnostic space, it was a
declining to slightly best -- at best, flat business. And that's been a nice
story for us in terms of integrating it. We're going to be looking for now
improving the growth of the new product pipeline and momentum going forward in
that business, which is incrementally positive for the business. As I already
mentioned, Nutrition, compared to the prior 4, 5 years, has a nice, steady,
sustainable forward-looking growth in the, let's call it, 3% to 5% range,
somewhere in there. And that's a plus, that's an upside. The pipeline in
devices is strong. It's good. I mean, we spoke earlier in the year about the
COAPT trial driving MitraClip in Structural Heart. And there's a nice pipeline
of products and enhancements coming behind that. We just launched or got
approval for HeartMate 3 for destination therapy, some additional catheters in
our Electrophysiology business that help us be even more competitive than the
20% growth rate we've got now. Just everything across the board gets better.
Where do we see problems? Well, we got a couple of places that we're not too
happy about our own performance in. We know neuromod is a super good growth
business. We expect to see sequentially improving growth out of that business
over the course of the year. I've talked about that on previous calls. We
believe we're in control of our destiny there. And if we -- if anything, I
probably estimated the speed at which we could correct our direction there
wrong. It's taken a little longer than I would have guessed. But that's going
to get sequentially better, and I think that's a plus. The Point of Care
business that's part of our Diagnostic business, not Alere but the -- our own
Point of Care business, we had some corrections to make in our strategy, and
we've done that. And so I'm quite optimistic that our management team there has
a good path, a good management team, et cetera. That'll improve.

So if I had a concern at all, it's the things I can't
control. I think our fundamental underlying strategy in the pharmaceutical
business is solid. I think the underlying growth rates in emerging markets are
solid. I know the world worries about the volatility of those markets and the
reliability of those markets and, in particular, currency. And we're all going
to live with currency if we're a multinational company, and I don't think we're
any different. And to be honest, we're not that differently indexed now with
the addition of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics and so forth in the
company. So while we may have, let's call it, individual spotty circumstances
in any given emerging market in any given year, which we kind of expect, I
think the underlying growth of that business, driven by the development of
those economies, the health care systems, is solid. So I look at all aspects of
the company. Whenever we're not performing where we think we should in a given
business, we do take corrective steps. And as I look across the portfolio,
every single business which had such a great year last year actually had a
little better one this year or a lot better one this year and on a sustainable
basis going forward. So as I look forward into '19, I note that there's a lot
of caution in the world about economies and any number of other things. We base
our growth rates and our growth projections on our products, on the market dynamics
we see in each of our product areas in the segments we compete in. And we've
got a rich portfolio of products right now and a rich portfolio of products
coming out of our organic R&D and a lot of longevity on the driving of
those products in the market for years to come. So whatever the windiness of
the currency markets or other things may be, we've demonstrated through '18 and
will demonstrate into '19 that we can power through that and continue to
deliver the kind of growth that our shareholders reliably expect.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS: Great, that's really helpful. And
maybe one for Brian. On the bottom line, EPS guidance implies growth of 9% to
13% on a reported basis, closer to mid-teens on a constant currency basis. This
is higher than what we've seen in the past from Abbott but also off the higher
starting top line. So as we go through the year, if there's incremental upside,
how should investors think about the willingness to allow that to fall to the
bottom line versus reinvesting in the business at these growth rates?

BRIAN B. YOOR: I'll defer to Miles on that question because
I know he makes the choices ultimately between the balance of growth, the
sustainable growth versus what we give back to shareholders. But I think we've
shown a good propensity to be balanced in that. We showed that demonstration
even last year as we gave some pennies back to The Street when we had a
variable tax rate but invested heavily in the growth opportunities that Miles
talked about that creates the kind of sustainable growth that we're looking
for.

Your math is right. I said back on the October call that
exchange would be around 4% to the bottom line impact. It's just a little touch
above 4%. You could imply that, that would mean about mid-teens EPS growth. And
even as you look at our quarters, I mentioned in my script that FX would be
more front-end loaded. It's a first half phenomenon. But underlying growth that
we're portraying here for the first quarter and the full year is pretty
range-bound in that underlying double-digit earnings per share growth of the
mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of points. And there's a lot of underlying
gross margin improvement still going on across our businesses. There's a lot of
synergy still being captured in gross margins as well as in SG&A as it
pertains to our continued integration with St. Jude and also with Rapid
Diagnostics. So you're seeing the margin expansion come through in our op
margin line in our guidance.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes, I'd reiterate a couple of things. This
is Miles. First of all, Brian mentioned, exchange, as we know it right now, is
factored into our guidance, and we're still at a double-digit EPS growth. The
exchange that we're, I don't know, seeing in our guidance is a factor of last
year, meaning '18, that we've got to lap. And so it's that roll-through that is
currently taking us from what otherwise would have been 15% to what at the
midpoint would be 11%. So we're still at healthy double digits and it's, in
effect, caused by lapping last year's guidance. None of us are currency
traders, so there's no way to kind of predict what's going to happen with the
year, and I hesitate to do so for fear that fates strike us down. But with
regard to profits and performance and so forth, I'd say the company has always
been fortunate that it's had strong profits and strong cash flow. And with
regard to forecasting and so forth, we start every year with a double-digit
target and a high bar, and that's our aspiration every single year. And gosh,
more often than not, that's where we start with our guidance. Now having said
that, out of the last 11 years -- and why do I not go back further than 11
years? I don't have the data, but I could get it. But in -- out of the last 44
quarters that we have reported, we have beat 39 of them, exceeded the
investors' expectations, beat 39 of them and met on 5. And so I think the
company has demonstrated that if it exceeds its expectations, if it exceeds
Wall Street's expectations, if it exceeds in performance, we do share that back
to our investors in increased profitability or increased return to the
investor. And there's no reason to see a change to that. We've got strong cash
flow. We are able to cover all of our cash and investment needs from a capital
standpoint, from a dividend standpoint. We have the capacity to buy back shares
to offset dilution and, frankly, buy back shares if it's the best investment
that we can make. We have the capacity to do M&A. We've obviously been able
to pay down a lot of debt and very, very rapidly so that we would have the
balance sheet flexibility that we want. So we had very strong performance,
strong profitability, strong cash flow. And so if we exceed our expectations
and our performance, then obviously, we have the decision -- and that's a nice
place to be. We have the decision to share that with our investors, which is
exactly what our investors would expect. And you can tell that 90% of the
quarters for the last 11 years, investors have benefited.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from David Lewis from
Morgan Stanley.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Miles, just a couple for you. In thinking about or listening to your commentary
on 2019, the one comment that comes to mind was balance, your commentary that
most businesses get better or a lot better. That being said, a lot of investors
are still very focused on Libre and MitraClip. So as you think about the
guidance and how it was formulated, how dependent is 2019 guidance on a
significant inflection for MitraClip or a Libre 2 product launch?

MILES D. WHITE: Zero.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Okay, that's pretty clear. I guess we can
leave it at that. The second point, so...

MILES D. WHITE: No, it is. I mean -- I think, I mean, to be
honest, I'm not trying to be coy with you. It's very hard to predict what the
regulatory timing will be, for example, on MitraClip. So -- and there's no
reason for us to kind of play with the number and play with something that
we're not sure we can predict. So what we do know is when it comes, which is
very compelling -- there's a number of things that have to happen. FDA has to
approve it. We obviously would want CMS to reimburse it and so on. And I think
it'll have that kind of compelling story with the regulatory bodies. It's
obviously -- the COAPT study was very powerful, and I think the regulatory
bodies will give that all the right consideration. But trying to pin that down
and trying to pin down timing and so forth is not something that's easy to do.
And I'm not sure we'd be doing our investors any good service by trying to
predict that. What I do know is it's compelling. When it comes, it'll come and
it'll have impact. And rather than put it in our estimates, we haven't.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Okay, very clear. And then just following
up on another point you made in this morning. Thinking about the balance sheet,
I mean, you went from 2 years ago an overlevered company to now, frankly,
relative to peers an underlevered company. I think debt paydown and free cash
generation were sort of unsung heroes of last year. So many of other companies
have picked up the relative pace of M&A. You're still growing at a pretty
robust 7-plus percent rate without significant M&A the last couple of
years. So where do you stand now as you think about reinvestment for growth? How
active are you likely to be in '19 relative to '18 on the M&A front?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I'd say a couple of things. First of
all, you earn your highest return on organic growth and not your highest return
on M&A. And then I mean, as you know, a lot of M&A deals struggle to
return a good return to shareholders. We've had, let's say, an excellent track
record -- going back deep in our history with Knoll and Humira and so forth,
we've had a really good track record with the M&A we've done over time. And
we've managed those companies and their products well over time. So I'd say,
first of all, you make much higher return on your organic growth. The growth
we're getting from all of our businesses and even St. Jude is coming out of
pipeline, and it's coming out of our own organic development, et cetera. And
right now, those are the highest returns, those are the highest, biggest
opportunities, and we certainly don't see gaps right now that we have to fill
with M&A. So we're able to return a pretty good sales and profit growth
rate across the business. We've also been careful over time. There's times to
be in the M&A markets and there's times not to be. And when multiples are
really high, bad time to buy. And -- but to be honest, I don't see anything
right now that is so appealing that we feel like that's necessarily a good
direction for us. And the kinds of things we might look at, well, I would never
tell you anyway, and you know that. But right now, our opportunities are so
good with our own organic products and execution that we don't need it. And
there's not something that's so attractive -- all of the various investment
banking houses that you can imagine have put many things in front of us as
opportunities as they do every company, et cetera. So it's not like we're not
aware of what opportunities may be out there. It's just they wouldn't meet our
criteria. I don't see something compelling. I don't see something that we need.
And right now, we're in a fortunate position where we've got very strong
products and pipelines and strategies across all of our businesses.

I will say we can execute better in some places, but you
can't buy that. So we fix our own execution with our talent and strategies and
so forth. But it's just not necessary for us to put our money into M&A right
now because I don't think we'd turn a better return for our shareholders now or
at least in the foreseeable future doing that. We're going to make a lot more
money for our shareholders, investing in our growth, investing in the products
we have, investing in our expansion, investing in our own capital. And as you
know, we have plenty of cash flow to do that, and we have plenty of cash flow
that we can still return increasing dividends. And at some point here, we'll
have a choice. We're going to keep paying down debt because I think it's a good
idea. Our debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now is below 2, and as you know, it
was more like 4 to 4.3 when we completed the Alere and St. Jude deals. That
wasn't that long ago. So to have brought our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down that
far and that fast, and particularly, as we look forward in a rising interest
rate environment or potentially so, depending on what you believe, I think
we're doing the right things in the management of our balance sheet. I wanted to
get that debt down fast; we have. I wanted to have strategic flexibility; we
have it. What I really want is capital allocation flexibility to earn the right
returns and the optimal returns for our shareholders, and I think we're in that
position. So I just don't see M&A right now as a high priority.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from
BMO Capital Markets.

JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH, MD & RESEARCH ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL
MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: I'm going to take the flip side of David's question.
Instead of thinking about M&A and adding things, how do you feel about
having all 4 legs of the stool remain in the Abbott house? I think there was
some lay press discussion regarding a possible sale of the nutritionals
business.

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I get that speculation, jeez, if I
don't get it every quarter, it's almost every quarter. So thanks for asking the
question, Joanne. We like our mix right now. There's a role to everything in
our portfolio. And the one I'm asked more frequently about than anything is
Nutrition. And you can transact, you can try to make money for your
shareholders with transactions, but I would say this: as you know, Joanne, I've
been in this job a long time. And earlier in my tenure, there was a role for
Nutrition in our portfolio. And I got the same question then. And one of the
roles was it's got a global presence, global infrastructure. It's highly
profitable, generates a lot of cash. And a lot of the M&A activities and
other things that we did back in my earlier years benefited from the cash flows
and position of Nutrition. And even today, there are great benefits to our
Nutrition business to the company. And that's not to say that any given part of
the company has to be part of it. It's clearly a different business as is our
pharmaceutical business, et cetera. But today, I'd say, look, it makes sense as
part of our company. I don't think we need to be considering a transaction just
to do it. We're well valued. We're performing well. I don't honestly think I
would create more value for our investors by separating it. If everybody asks
you about it often enough, you go look at it. Okay, I've looked at it. I don't
think we can create differential improved value for our shareholders than what
is already being executed by us. I think that's a plus. I think that in
general, while a lot of people might ask me about it, it's also performing
well. I'm happy that it's performing a lot better than it did for a couple of
years there. So it's just not on my radar screen. I don't think we're going to
improve Abbott. I don't think we're going to create value by considering it.
And I think we'll distract ourselves with that at a time we don't even need to
be distracted. So it's just not on my radar screen as a way to create value for
shareholders because I don't think it will. And I think it's being well valued
as part of Abbott as is the rest of Abbott. So it's just not on my radar screen
and -- nor do I think it's necessarily beneficial to us. I guess that's the
simplest thing to say.

JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH: Okay, appreciate that. As a follow-up,
2 businesses I just want to talk about the pipeline. Neuromod, what does it
take to reaccelerate that growth rate? And then you talked about an Alere
pipeline, which I don't think The Street is really focused on. If you could
just give us some highlights there.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. So first of all, the single biggest
thing that immediately will change how we're doing in neuromod is actually our
sales force expansion in the U.S. and our training and execution there. And
that's what we're focused on. Then longer term, we put a lot of emphasis in our
R&D pipeline. We have a number of new people, new management, broader
pipeline under development, I'm not going to give you any kind of insights to
it and so forth because I don't really want to get the world focused on it. But
it's an area where we think there's a lot of opportunity in the types of
products we have. We don't think we've sort of fully gotten the benefit of the
2 main products we have now. And so I'd say it's got our attention. We've
doubled our investment in R&D there. And I think in the coming years, we'll
see that roll out. What was the second part after neuromod?

JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH: Pipeline in Alere.

MILES D. WHITE: Rapid Diagnostics. We've reorganized the
Rapid Diagnostics business into 4 segments. Each of them has their emphasis,
their target. Each has an R&D plan. Each has a new product plan. We are
increasing our investment in R&D also there. I can give you a couple of
high points and examples. Infectious disease product, ID now, which we think
has got a lot of potential that we're rolling out. The Afinion 2
cardiometabolic platform, another opportunity that we're putting emphasis
behind. But I think there's -- generally speaking, there's a lot more
possibility for us in incrementally updating and renewing a number of these
platforms, and then there's newer stuff than that. And so when we took over the
company, which we've now had in our possession a little over a year, one of our
targets was to get our hands around the R&D of each of these segments and
make sure we had an R&D plan in place, so there was a steady cadence of
improvements and new products in each of these businesses. That does take a
little time. In our first year, a lot of our focus was stabilizing the
organization, its structure, the management, people, execution of what we've
got, synergies, et cetera, which we've talked about. Now our attention turns to
this, and it has been. I mean, we've been increasing our spending and
increasing our focus on this. And that's what the management team is focused on
now, is that new product cadence. So beyond that, I don't want to be more
specific. Otherwise, we'll be tracking it all here.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank
of America.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFA MERRILL
LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just wanted to follow up, if I might, on the
commentary earlier on MitraClip given its visibility. Can you just give us a
sense as to what the growth rate of MitraClip was in the fourth quarter? And
then to be clear, relative to your earlier comments, do you really not assume
U.S. approval and reimbursement for MitraClip in FMR at all in 2019? Is that --
that's not assumed at all?

MILES D. WHITE: No, that's not what I said, and that's not
what the question was. I'm not assuming that. But the question was whether or
not that was pivotal to making our earnings guidance for the year or our sales
guidance. And the answer was, it has no bearing on our sales and earnings
guidance for the year.

But you're asking me a different question now, do I expect
approval? And I'd say, well, we'll see. I mean, we're certainly hopeful that
we'll get that kind of consideration. And is it possible? I suppose it's
possible, but we don't know. We just don't know. Scott?

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER: Yes. With respect to the
MitraClip growth rate, MitraClip grew about 30% in the fourth quarter.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS: Okay. So it accelerated a little bit.
Okay, I hear you on MitraClip.

And then the other sort of product-oriented question that I
wanted to ask is that you mentioned in your remarks that Libre is getting some
preferred copay status. And I was just -- I found that intriguing. I was just
wondering if you could expand on what that means specifically, how broad the
program is. Is that just because Libre is a little lower cost? Or are payers
trying to incentivize patients to use Libre? So maybe just a little color on
the copay status.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER: Yes. I mean, as you think about
copay status and the way payers use it, that is essentially what they're trying
to do, is they're trying to incent a preferred offering with respect to the
value proposition that, that offering brings. So as we progress in the second
half of the year in our payer dialogue, we saw that certain payers were
starting to put Libre in a higher tier, Tier 2, which would result for the end
patient in a lower copay, quite frankly. And again, I think as they look at the
overall value proposition, the outcomes data and whatnot, they see a compelling
argument to do it, and we're starting to see that trend.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from
RBC Capital Markets.

GLENN JOHN NOVARRO, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Two device questions. First, on Rhythm Management in the
quarter, down 2% to 3%. Is that market softness? Or are you guys just losing
share to Boston Scientific because of their HeartLogic feature or losing share
to Medtronic because they've got Micra, the leadless pacer? So that's the first
question.

And then the Vascular business, down 5% in the U.S. That
would -- that's surprising to me given you're launching XIENCE Sierra. So
similar question, is this just the market is weaker in drug-eluting stents for
the U.S.? Is it more pricing pressure? Or is the product simply not gaining
traction?

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER: Yes. I'll start with Rhythm
Management here. And as you know, when we acquired that business, it was
declining at a fairly heavy clip. We've been able to stabilize it. The overall
market, to your point, is down modestly, and our performance is generally in
line with that.

When it comes to Vascular, same thing. Again, the market is
down modestly. XIENCE Sierra is doing well. It's capturing share. In fact, we
gained about 5 share points since the launch of XIENCE Sierra. Pricing in the
space remains a challenge for all of the market, but XIENCE Sierra is
definitely performing there. And quite frankly, our performance overall is a
little bit above the market.

MILES D. WHITE: Glenn, what you're also seeing there is a
reduction in third-party royalty revenue, not share. The stent and the system,
XIENCE Sierra, are capturing share, but what you're seeing is the roll-through
of loss of a third-party revenue.

GLENN JOHN NOVARRO: Okay. And one follow-up. Can you give us
an update on both your TAVR and mitral program? TAVR, specifically Portico,
when do we see a U.S. filing and approval? And then mitral, update on Tendyne
enrollment and then maybe comment on the latest acquisition.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER: Yes. On TAVR, we would expect to
file that here in the second half of this year. We're wrapping up that trial as
we speak. With respect to Tendyne and Cephea, obviously, we're expanding them.
We've had a long-term vision here in the mitral space to really build a
toolbox. Tendyne, we filed actually for CE Mark before the end of last year. So
we could possibly see approval here this year. The U.S. is still several years
away. And the Cephea program looks like a really great program, but again,
still several years away.

OPERATOR: And our final question comes from Rick Wise from
Stifel.

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE, MD & SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH
ANALYST, STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe
just one big picture and one product question. Brian has done and the team has
done a fabulous job paying down debt. You highlighted some thoughts about the
-- your comfort in not doing M&A in today's portfolio. Obviously, that
suggests share buyback and dividend. You've touched on it a little bit. But
just wondering, are you feeling strongly about taking your excess cash and
dividing it equally depending on stock price? I mean, do you have a priority?
Is there some -- how are you thinking about it?

MILES D. WHITE: No, I don't think about it as dividing it
equally. There's -- for any particular capital use, there's a timing, and
there's -- or there's a need. If we got to invest in capacity internally and
manufacturing and so forth, obviously, that's a good thing. And as I've said,
we can afford all of that and more. We're keeping our dividend healthy. We
target our dividend generally in a range 40% or higher of our EPS as a payout
ratio, a nice healthy range. And a number of our peer group don't do that at
all. So I think we've got a good healthy dividend. And that matters to us
because we have a large segment of investors that care about that. With regard
to M&A, M&A is necessarily opportunistic. It depends on the product,
the company, the business, the timing, market values, multiple, all sorts of
things. And right now, I don't see any of that lining up to say, "Wow,
there's something we're dying to go look at." And then with regard to
share buybacks, Rick, it sort of depends on valuations in the market. There's
times when share buybacks aren't that economical and other times when they're
high return. And on our case, right now, we've got the flexibility. If we want
to do any kind of share buyback just to offset dilution and so forth, we can do
that. And -- but I think you kind of -- you got to look at it and say, "Is
that my best use of cash?" I still want to pay down debt. I don't want to
assume we're just going to carry this forward. We paid down a lot of debt fast.
It would actually be in our interest to keep doing that, to keep paying it
down. I think we're well into a reasonable range now of debt, but we still want
to keep paying that debt down. And our cash flow is strong enough that we do
have choice. We do -- we have the ability to pay the dividend. We have the
ability to do all these things. We can satisfy our capital needs internally. So
I think -- I guess the best thing about it is we don't think about it in any
mechanistic or formula way, dividing it in half or whatever. We kind of look at
where the best -- where the need is and where the best return is. And I think
it behooves us to leave ourselves also in a very strong position at a lower
debt level. So we got places to use it and places to use it economically. When
-- before tax reform, when so much cash was trapped overseas, we were fortunate
that we had M&A opportunities to invest that cash for good return. We're
not stuck like that now. We can manage cash, manage the cash flows of the
company and so forth far more efficiently in terms of the best returns or the
best needs. And that's kind of how we look at it. If we find that our best use
of the cash or a strong use of the cash is share buybacks, we'd certainly
consider that. But right now, I wouldn't say that's our highest priority either.
It's still a high priority to just keep paying down the debt. And a couple of
years down the road here, depending on what happens with interest rates and so
forth, we'd probably be glad we did, and we'll have tremendous strategic
flexibility and still have very strong cash flow. So I think it just depends on
circumstances at a given point in time.

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE: Yes, that's a great answer. And just
last, maybe quickly, I know you love to talk about what could push you to the
upper end of your 6.5% to 7% guidance for '19. But there were some wild cards
that helped out. You exceeded your initial 2018 organic growth guidance in '18.
Maybe just touch on quickly, if you would, what could push you to the upper end
or above for your '19 range?

MILES D. WHITE: Oh, I think there's -- Rick, I think there's
a number of product things that could do that. We've already mentioned
MitraClip is a possibility. And it wouldn't take a whole lot, a couple of ticks
in any of these businesses of improvement. Last year, our Nutrition business
actually did better than we expected. We thought it would do better than prior
years, but it did better than that and better than we expected. And some of
those tick-ups make a big difference. And so I think if we turn the corner as we
expect to and plan to, things like neuromod and other places where we know the
fundamental underlying business is strong, it doesn't take a whole lot to sort
of correct the underperformance of some businesses, whether it's our Point of
Care business or neuromod or some of individual countries in the pharmaceutical
business. And the upside here is fairly strong.

SCOTT MICHAEL LEINENWEBER: Very good. Well, thank you,
operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's
conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00
a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning, and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any
participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the
entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed
written permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Good
morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice
President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening
remarks, and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail.
Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2018. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological
and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A,
Risk Factors, through our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Abbott undertakes no obligation
to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of
subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that
third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for
sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations
only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless
otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth,
which adjusts the 2017 basis of comparison to exclude the impact of exchange
and historical results for Abbott's Medical Optics and St. Jude's vascular
closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017 as
well as current and prior year sales for Alere, which was acquired on October
3, 2017.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES D. WHITE, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD & CEO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, we reported results
of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.75 along with
sales growth of approximately 8% on an organic basis, reflecting well-balanced
growth across all 4 of our businesses.

I'm particularly pleased with the continued productivity of
our new product pipeline and would like to highlight a couple areas where our
products are creating and fundamentally shaping markets.

I'll start with Structural Heart, where we're the world --
or the global leader in minimally invasive treatments for mitral regurgitation
or a leaky heart valve. We've recently made several significant advancements in
this area. In July, in the U.S., we initiated a pivotal trial for Tendyne, our
device that's designed to replace damaged mitral heart valves without the need
for open heart surgery. We also received U.S. FDA approval for our
third-generation version of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the repair
of mitral heart valve. And in September, we announced the results of our
landmark COAPT trial, which demonstrated the MitraClip improved survival in
clinical outcomes for patients with functional mitral regurgitation, the most prevalent
form of this condition. We expect to submit this study data to the U.S. FDA in
the coming weeks to support consideration of an expanded indication for
MitraClip. These advancements will further enhance and strengthen our
leadership position in this large and highly underpenetrated disease area and
will bring new therapies to patients where effective treatment options are
currently limited.

Diabetes Care is another area where our technologies are
making a big impact, specifically FreeStyle Libre, a revolutionary glucose
monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks. In the
U.S., we received FDA approval for a 14-day sensor with a shorter 1-hour
warm-up, making Libre the longest lasting wearable glucose sensor available.
And in Europe, we obtained CE Mark for our FreeStyle Libre 2 system, our newest
generation 14-day system with optional real-time alarms.

In a relatively short period of time, FreeStyle Libre now
has more than 1 million users across the globe, a testament to the mass market
appeal of this product, which is fundamentally changing the way people with
diabetes manage their disease.

I'll now summarize our third quarter results in more detail
before turning the call over to Brian. I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales
grew 7.5% in the quarter. Alinity, our family of highly differentiated
instruments, is achieving accelerated growth and strong competitive win rates
in Europe, where more than 50% of our Alinity instrument placements, thus far,
are coming from share capture. The global rollout of Alinity positions this
business for consistent above-market growth for years to come, as we capture
share and bring the full suite of systems to additional geographies, including
the U.S.

In Rapid Diagnostics, third quarter sales were driven by
cardiometabolic testing. We just completed the first year anniversary of our
acquiring this business, and we're pleased with the progress we've made to
position ourselves for growth and margin expansion going forward.

In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales were led by
double-digit growth in several geographies, including Russia and China. As
expected, sales growth in the quarter was impacted by a difficult comparison
versus the prior year when we saw channel restocking across the market in India
following implementation of a new tax system in that country.

Our unique branded generics business focused specifically on
key emerging, markets continues to execute its strategy and grow faster than
the market in several of our priority countries, including India and China.

In Nutrition, sales increased 6% in the quarter, led by a
strong performance in our international business. In Pediatric Nutrition,
global growth was well balanced across infant and toddler nutrition as well as
above-market growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth broadly across our
international markets. And in adult nutrition, growth was led by our
market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands, most notably internationally, where
we achieved 7% growth overall in adult nutrition

Lastly, I'll cover our results for Medical Devices, where
sales grew 10% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology,
Structural Heart and Diabetes Care.

In Electrophysiology, growth of 20% was led by double-digit
growth across our heart mapping and ablation portfolio as well as Confirm, the
world's first and only smartphone-compatible insertable cardiac monitor.

In Structural Heart, we achieved strong growth across
several areas of our portfolio, including more than 20% growth of MitraClip and
double-digit growth of AMPLATZER PFO, our minimally invasive device that plugs
life-threatening holes in the heart.

And in Diabetes Care, sales grew 40% in the quarter, led by
FreeStyle Libre, which achieved sales of over $300 million in the quarter, an
increase of more than 100% versus the prior year.

So in summary, this was another very good quarter with all 4
businesses contributing to strong growth overall. Our pipeline continues to be
highly productive, including significant recent advancements in Structural
Heart and Diabetes Care that are creating and shaping markets.

And lastly, we're forecasting EPS and organic sales growth
at the upper end of the range, as we said at the beginning of the year.

I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results
and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?

BRIAN B. YOOR, EXECUTIVE VP OF FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all
references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic
basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.

Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter
increased 7.8% on an organic basis. Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired late
last year and is therefore not included in our organic sales growth results,
achieved sales of $481 million. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year
impact of 2.7% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S.
dollar strengthened versus several currencies, resulting in a larger unfavorable
impact on our results this quarter compared to the expectations had exchange
rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in July.

Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross
margin ratio was 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.3% of sales
and adjusted SG&A expense is 29.7% of sales.

Turning to our outlook for the full year 2018. We forecast
organic sales growth of approximately 7%, at the top end of the guidance range
we provided at the beginning of the year. At current rates, we expect exchange
would now have a slightly negative impact on full year reported sales.

In addition, we continue to expect Rapid Diagnostics to
contribute sales of a little more than $2 billion.

We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59.5%
of sales, which includes underlying gross margin improvement across our
businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of a little less than 7.5%
of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales.

Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2018. We
forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.80 to $0.82. We forecast organic sales growth of
mid- to high single digits. And at current exchange rates, we'd expect exchange
to have a negative impact of a little more than 3% on reported sales.

In addition, we expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute sales
of around $500 million in the fourth quarter, which, as I previously mentioned,
is not included in our organic growth rate this year.

Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide an
overview of our fourth quarter organic sales growth outlook by business.

For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast
mid-single-digit sales growth, which reflects the difficult comparison in our
noncore other business segment relative to the fourth quarter of last year when
sales increased strong double digits.

In Nutrition, we forecast low- to mid-single-digit sales
growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid- to high-single-digit sales growth. And
in Medical Devices, we forecast high-single-digit sales growth, which reflects
double-digit growth in several areas of this business.

With that, we will now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes
from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: We cannot hear the question, operator.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Can
you hear me now?

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Yes.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: So Miles, 2 questions for you. Obviously,
a lot of business momentum here in 2018 and meaningful drivers ahead, like
Libre 2 and MitraClip. So as you think about sort of sustainability, is sort of
6% to 7% range sustainable over the intermediate term? And how are you feeling
about Abbott's ability to deliver double digits or low teen earnings given the
currency environment in all of these various opportunities to grow?

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. Thanks, David. Let me take the first
part of that. The answer is sort of definitively and absolutely yes on the
sustainability of earnings. In fact -- rather, sales top line, and I'll get to
earnings in a minute. In that 6% to 7% range, I say yes. And frankly, I'm even
looking at 7% and better. But if you look at the underlying momentum of each of
these businesses today and the underlying growth of each of these businesses,
there's actually some places, I think, it could get better. There's places
we're, obviously, trying to improve. I wouldn't forecast it yet, but I still
see plenty of growth, plenty of opportunity, frankly, with the new product
pipeline for years to come. And you're seeing the evidence of that right now in
the performance of all the businesses. The Diagnostics business growth rate is
clearly turned up. That is clearly the impact of Alinity taking hold. It's
having great success in Europe. Libre is doing super well. And on top of that,
we haven't really put a lot of promotional emphasis behind it. So I see a
strong future for both of those. The new product cadence coming out of Medical
Devices is really good. And frankly, we expect another approval imminently here
in the U.S. So I think that in terms of the sustainability of top line, I feel
very good about that. I feel really good about the underlying growth of the
company, the sustainability of it, et cetera. The little elephant in the room
is clearly exchange. And I think that's true for practically every
multinational out there. I think all of us, all investors, all companies doing
business in international markets are experiencing the upturn in exchange now.
And frankly, a bit of uncertainty about how long it lasts because every time we
enter a new year, we kind of think we've got a notion of what exchange and
currency and so forth is going to do, and it never last the entire year. We
always see a change once or twice during the year. And some of that is just
driven by news. Some of it is driven by trade talk and other things. But it's
-- I think, for all of us, it's a little hard to forecast. So we see that -- in
the third quarter, we've seen a tick-up in currency impact. We're clearly
moving into a headwind here. We'll see that in the fourth quarter. And I think
that's going to continue into next year. The question is, how far into next
year? And how heavy is that headwind? And on our case, we look at the overall
business and say, "Look, the underlying growth rates, the underlying
strength of the business is really strong." And we've been able,
historically, to absorb exchange, mitigate exchange, deal with exchange, et
cetera, and be a very reliable performer for our investors. And that's always
our goal. We always start the year with a double-digit earnings goal every
year. And it's the rare year when we don't achieve that, hit it or exceed it.
And this is no different. I think, right now, we're a few months ahead of next
year. And a lot always happens in the first quarter. So we don't have any way
to reliably tie down what we think currency is going to do. I don't think
anybody does, obviously. I know that it will be a headwind starting out. What
happens from there, who knows? But we go into the year looking at double
digits. And with underlying growth like we have in all of our businesses, I'd
say, that was pretty solid.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Okay. Miles, very clear. And the second,
just a follow-up for you is just, can you help us put the Robert Ford announcement
into perspective and sort of share your thoughts on what it means for you over
the intermediate term?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, what it means to me over the
intermediate term is I get a lot more help, which I'm happy about. Look, it's
obviously a succession step. And one of the things that I think any good
leader's got to do with his company is make sure that there's always good,
strong succession, building, growing, et cetera, in the company. And that
applies to me, too. So I think, for the continuity of the performance of this
company, the continuity of its strategies, the continuity of it sustainable
growth rates and so forth going forward, that's important. Robert Ford has been
in this company this entire year. I've known him 22 years and pay a lot of
attention to his career, as you might imagine. And he's been an excellent
operator. He's handled our entire St. Jude integration, done a terrific job
with Medical Devices. And consequently, I want all of those Medical Device
businesses continuing to report directly to him, even as he takes on more
responsibility. And I'd say, with time, this will develop pretty nicely. And I
think it's a very good strong move for the company.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from
JPMorgan.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Miles, wanted to ask you about COAPT. A lot of us were at
the TCT conference in San Diego last month and saw the great data there to a
room of standing ovation, which we don't see in Medical Devices that often. So
us on The Street, we can think about big numbers with such a large patient
opportunity. Maybe tell us how you're thinking about MitraClip over the next
few years and how you think The Street should be thinking about it.

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I'll tell you what. Obviously, the
performance of MitraClip in that study was a real home run. And it's not often
that studies are so definitively positive and so good in terms of their impact
for patients. So we're, obviously, very happy about that and very proud of
that. Our objective will be to move through the regulatory processes as rapidly
as can be done and make it available for that use as rapidly as we can. I think
the medical community sees tremendous medical benefit in that. And when you can
make that kind of a difference, it's obviously big, important, good thing. And
how rapidly we go through that regulatory process, hard to predict. We have not
got a lot of -- well, we don't have any particular impact for next year in our
roadmap for next year, at this point, for any impact from that product, so
anything that happens is upside. And obviously, beyond that, I think it's got a
pretty sizable opportunity. And it's not a broad mass market product, but the
number of patients that will benefit from the product is significant. And so I
think it will clearly make a difference in the overall performance of the
company, this Medical Device business, the company, et cetera. It's not one
that's going to get lost in rounding error, I can tell you that. Scott, do you
want to add anything to that?

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: No, that's fair. We'll submit, as
Miles mentioned in his prepared remarks, to the FDA in the coming weeks. And
after that, it's in their hands, and we'll let that process play out.

ROBERT JUSTIN MARCUS: Okay. Great. Maybe a follow-up on
Libre. This is a product that's been wildly successful and now over $100
million run rate in the U.S., over $1 billion globally. And you really have one
major competitor here that's, let's call it, at the upper end of the technology
scale. And Abbott, I view as the low cost, easy to access, very easy-to-use
product in continuous glucose monitoring. So as we think about the evolution of
Libre over the next few years, how do you think about Libre staying at the
lower end of the cost and ease-of-use curve versus moving up and trying to
compete with your main competitor there?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I'll tell you, interestingly enough, I
don't actually look at it the way you just described. I think Libre is a pretty
different product. It's a -- it's got tremendous capability. But given that
value point that we have it priced at, it is accessible to patients all over
the world. And when we first launched in Europe, we launched without any
government reimbursement. And for the first time, glucose monitoring was
patient pay. And it had wildly great acceptance just on that basis, which
actually encouraged governments to reimburse the product. So I think with
health care today, a lot of things that come to market are very expensive,
whether they are pharmaceuticals or devices. And in this particular case, it
was important that this have a medical and a -- an economic value proposition
that made it accessible to all patients or as many as possible. And there's
tens of millions of diabetes patients out there. Obviously, there's type 1s and
insulin-dependent patients and there's type 2s trying not to be. And so the
product has a much broader appeal across a much broader patient base. And in
our case, we have a much lower cost and far greater automated manufacturing
capability to not only allow that cost, but to allow for mass production. And
that's the path we've taken. And we've gone at this from an access standpoint
that's far more retail and direct-to-consumer-oriented. It's made a big
difference. So I'd say, at this point, we're making healthy profits on this
product. We have no intention of changing the value proposition at all. I mean,
your question sort of suggests that we would raise price in order to be
competitive. I'd say, you ought to be asking the other side what are they going
to do to make themselves a value proposition because this product is an
incredibly good value proposition, which is why it's got such high demand. And
to be honest, we don't even measure ourselves relative to any competition,
including finger stick, at this point. We know how many potential patients that
are out there. And it's our intent to capture the vast majority or possible
maximum of them that we possibly can in just a few years. So I look at Libre
right now, and a lot of people call it a wild success. I kind of think we're
just getting started. And we're investing heavily in capacity to allow even
more rapid expansion. And people will say, "Well, how do you model
that?" And I think I'm not sure we can model it. It's that good. So I'd
tell you, you probably need to think about this a little differently in terms
of value proposition and the kind of access that affords. And I think the
future of health care kind of demands that from us, from all companies. There
are certain products, obviously, there are small volume, there are niche
medical treatments and so forth that are costly to develop, costly to make and
provide and so forth. But there's others that have much broader impact and much
broader appeal. And part of the future of health care and the necessity for
companies like ours is making those things as broadly accessible as possible.
And we still, obviously, have to earn our return. And I could assure you, we're
making a nice healthy return on Libre.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank
of America.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFA MERRILL
LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: So 2 quick questions. First a product question and
then an earnings growth question. On the product side, obviously, the context
here is that Abbott is a company delivering absolutely top-of-class revenue
growth. But the one thing in the quarter that I wanted to ask about was
Neuromodulation. That was a little slower like the last quarter. I'm just
curious, is your outlook for that business changed at all? Or this is just
still temporary hiring issues? And when do you think you can return to more
like double-digit growth in that division?

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. Thanks. I think it's more of the same
from last quarter. And I do think this is temporary. I think it's going to take
us couple of quarters to work through, let's call it, the commercial execution
issue we have. And you don't fix that overnight, but we will fix it and fix it
in the near term. And I do think that this is a business that should return to
double-digit growth. So I can look at that as something that gets better for
us. It was, obviously, very strong last year. It hit a stall point during this
year. But I do think that upside is there. And it's strictly in our hands at
this point. So yes, I'm pretty optimistic about it. Do you go to bed happy
about it? No. Can you fix it? Yes, and we are.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS: Okay. Two other quick little things.
What was the U.S. -- imminent U.S. product approval you guys were highlighting
in your prepared remarks? And then I also wanted to just follow up really
quickly on David's question on earnings growth. And I realized you start every
year at 10%. The Street is modeling roughly 12% earnings growth for really the
next couple of years. Given all the puts and takes, is that a reasonable place
to start? Or could currency make that a little challenging?

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. First question is really easy. I was
referencing HeartMate 3 and a new claim. Second question, good question. I know
The Street is where it is. The Street, generally, in its consensus, hasn't
tried to factor in or tried to model exchange. And we're all looking at the
same exchange trends right now, even The Street. So I'd say, look, if I
privately pull the 20 analysts or so that -- on the sell side that cover
Abbott, or any company for that matter, you'd probably all say, "Well,
this is my current estimate based on underlying growth, but I'm not sure how
exchange is going to impact it." And secondly, I'm not sure how much
everybody is going to try to absorb in their P&L and how much they're going
to pass through in their estimates and so forth. I think we're all kind of in
that boat together right now. Do I think that 10% to 12% range right now is
reasonable? We start every year at double digits. And whatever -- I think, as I
said earlier, the underlying growth of these businesses is there. There's puts
and takes. There's ins and outs. There's not just product ins and outs. There's
tax rate. Everybody that experience tax reforms is going to experience some
adjustments in tax rates this year. There's puts and takes. We, obviously, made
a change in some of our debt cost with euro debt. That's a positive for us. So
there's a bunch of pluses and minuses we've got to sort out. The one that's
hard to forecast in some way is exchange. And yet, we were on the dot to the
penny or penny above or better every single quarter. So we tend to like a lot
of precision on our forecasting. And the hardest thing to forecast here is
exchange. So do I think that could be a bit of a mitigator here? It might be,
but we're all going to know a lot more about that in a few months when it's
time to set our guidance for next year. Historically, as you know, we have
always tried to offset in some fashion or mitigate as much exchange as
possible, so that we can reliably deliver what our investments -- what our
investors expect. I mean, there's -- look, there's a lot of moving parts in the
world, and we're always trying to synthesize all those moving parts and give
you, the investor, reliability to the penny every quarter. And so far, I think
for the last 15 to 20 years, we've been pretty damn good at that. Going into
next year, our goals will be no different. And right now, I think that even
analysts and their estimates that inform that 12% consensus that you referenced
as being out there now is subject to change by analysts factoring in exchange
or any number of other things. But in our case, we're always trying to mitigate
that. I don't know where it will come out. But I think somewhere in that range
is probably right. We'll be starting at 10%. And we'll see what happens after
that. I would tell you this, if exchange mitigates and we suddenly see a weak
dollar, we're not going to have a problem making you happy.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from
Evercore.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR, MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL
EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: So Miles, maybe the first one on the
sustainability question. If I'm looking at '19, you have MitraClip FMR
indication, which is incremental. Libre continues its strength. You have
HeartMate 3, which is incremental. Portico U.S. launch, which is incremental. A
stable CRM outlook. Neuromod, your comps get easy. Alinity, it should be
ramping in the U.S. It really feels like all the strength we've seen in '18,
they should continue into '19. So maybe can you just talk about some drivers or
how we should be thinking about the pluses and the minuses?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, Vijay, you forgot to mention Alere.
You forgot to mention COAPT. You forgot to mention some improvements in EPD.
It's interesting. I've never, in my career here, seen such breadth across the
company in new products, new product launches, market conditions, et cetera.
Even Nutrition, right now, is doing considerably better than it has the last
couple of years. I wouldn't forecast better for Nutrition, but I like what it's
doing right now. And EPD, it's in high growth or, at least, moderate to high
growth markets with great tailwinds. It of course has a currency headwind, like
everything else. But all of these things are performing really well. And even
the ones that you can see and forecast and track pretty well, like Libre or
Alinity, et cetera, they're actually accelerating. And that just gets better.
So I think the sustainability of the growth and the diversity of it is a huge
plus. It's not like we're reliant on a single product or a single country.
We're not highly indexed in China. And we're not overdependent on a single
product. There's just great diversity of growth opportunity across the board.
And I think the -- I'm really proud of the company from a productivity and
pipeline standpoint. That goes for St. Jude as well. As I've said a number of times,
St. Jude, in the course of our acquisition negotiations with them continued to
talk to us the veracity of their pipeline and how good it was. And to be
honest, they were right, and that's proven. So I'm pretty bullish on just the
diversity of opportunity here. And while we can try to point at 1 or 2 of them,
I think Libre and Alinity stick out. But incremental matters. And incremental
in any business here, whether it's HeartMate 3 or Neuro or even EPD or Alere or
anything us, Portico, all of these things contribute to the growth of the
company, and that's how we like it. We like every bit of this company
performing well.

VIJAY MUNIYAPPA KUMAR: That's helpful. And maybe one for
Brian. Brian, when you look at the guidance for Q4, any implication for '19? So
gross margin is at 59.5%. That would imply an acceleration to Q4. Any
particular reason why GM sequentially should step up? How much did FX cost you
guys in the EPS? There was a lot of questions on why guidance was not raised
for the year. And it looks like, at least, $0.05 cents hit in the back half
here. And is that sort of a similar number we should be thinking about just
given where FX is right when you think about for '19?

BRIAN B. YOOR: All right, Vijay. Let me start with the gross
margin. Our underlying gross margin improvement has been strong. It's ticking
up nearly about 0.5 point year-over-year, and that's largely the effect of our
synergies that are going on, both with respect to Alere and its integration.
And also contained synergies with St. Jude. And every year, we put an emphasis
on improving our underlying gross margin of all of our businesses. So we had
the healthy reinvestment back into the business. FX really not -- it mixes --
it moves around a little bit here and there. It changes every day, but it's not
really having too much of an impact. So we're seeing close to 40 bps of gross
margin improvement. That's all underlying for the year. Your observation on FX
as far as earnings is pretty spot on. If you recall, we came out at the beginning
of the year and we thought that FX would actually be a tailwind of about $0.05.
It's probably now closer to that $0.03 to $0.04 down on a full year basis. So
we're powering through that. We're powering through that with all the
underlying performance that Miles has talked about with respect to all the
businesses. So when you look under line, it's outstanding, very strong
performance that carries momentum into 2019.

MILES D. WHITE: I would just add one comment that blame it
on the CEO comment. I don't get overly worked up about raising in the fourth
quarter. We've been ahead all year. We're performing strong. Like you, I'm
looking at next year and the continuity and sustainability of it all. Whatever
the fourth quarter is, it will be. And we're not going to miss -- that's
incredibly unlikely. We are all observing that exchange is a bigger headwind.
But when you get to giving guidance for the fourth quarter or raising, I think,
generally, one is tweaking. And at this point in the year, I think tweaking for
one quarter is kind of -- I'm looking at next year. And so I wouldn't read too
much into that other than, look, the obvious. We all know exchanges is getting
headier. And -- but beyond that, I think the story here is the underlying
growth, and that is pretty strong and pretty sustainable. So don't read too
much into it.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from
Jefferies.

RAJBIR SINGH DENHOY, MD, EQUITY RESEARCH & SENIOR EQUITY
RESEARCH ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Wonder if I could maybe ask
about one of the areas in Medical Devices that continues to be sort of a little
slower, and that's Vascular. So couple questions there. One, is there anything
you can give us in terms of how the initial launch of the XIENCE Sierra stent
is doing? And second to that, also the PHP, your percutaneous pump is still --
that trial is still halted. So any updates in terms of when that might get
restarted?

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Raj, this is Scott. Yes, I would just
say with respect to the Vascular business, I think the big news item earlier
this year was the U.S. approval of our XIENCE Sierra stent. That's off to a
very good start. When you're going in to that, that physician feedback, I know
it was very positive to our experience in Europe there. So we've added Sierra
to a number of our contracts here in the U.S. We've actually recaptured several
share points in the U.S. during the quarter. We also launched a product in
Japan recently, and it's performing there very well. So the business had some
momentum. But honestly, Sierra stent, it's is a very good product. There's a
little bit of masking of that growth with respect to some of the noncommercial
royalty revenue that we get, but that's noise. The commercial side of the
business is really performing quite well with respect to that launch. With
respect to PHP, that's a program we're still committed to very much so. We have
not provided any updates on the time line of late. I would expect we will in
the future at some point.

RAJBIR SINGH DENHOY: Okay. Fair. Maybe just -- for my second
question just kind of a broader one on kind of the tone and outlook for the
business broadly. Obviously, it depends a lot on the portfolio that various
companies have. But is there anything you can offer in terms of how procedure
volumes and pricing broadly are tracking in the industry right now?

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Yes. No change, really. I mean,
procedures and demand volume from that side of things are fairly constant to
the way they've been running and trending for the last several quarters.
Pricing in some of the segments, such as CRM and Vascular, is a modest
headwind. But demand is strong, offsetting most of that. Those are really the
only 2 areas of the Medical Device business where we think about price. The
others are very healthy.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from
RBC Capital Markets.

GLENN JOHN NOVARRO, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Two quick questions. First, Miles, on Alere, you'll do $2
billion in revenue this year. I think that's hitting expectations. But Alere is
going to be folded into organic growth in 2019. So can you help us think about
Alere growth in 2019 and beyond? That's first question. And then quickly on
Libre 2, can you give us an update on the U.S. approval timing?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes, let me do Alere first. So our first
year -- you're spot on, on all your observations. Our first year was obviously
stabilized, integrated, organized, put management in place, et cetera. All
done, all done well and so on. And we benefited in this last year from -- and
probably one of the stronger flu seasons in a long time, so the infectious
diseases business in Alere, the infectious disease testing business did well in
that context. Going forward, obviously, we now need to turn to driving growth.
And I can't give you a forecast or prediction on that for '19 yet, or even '20
beyond that. But that's where the attention turns. I think we're mostly through
all the disruption and/or transition synergies, et cetera, all that activity.
In fact, I've got an update on that after this meeting later today. And at this
point, our entire emphasis turns to what kind of sustainable growth rate we can
now generate and trend out of that business. So I don't have a specific answer
for you yet, Glenn. But I think that's one of our growth drivers of the future.
And that's kind of next steps with it. And I'm sorry, what was the second half
of your question?

GLENN JOHN NOVARRO: Timing, Libre 2 in the U.S.

MILES D. WHITE: I might have to ask Scott for some help on
that because I'm not sure we can give you timing on that.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Yes, that's right, Miles. We haven't
provided timing yet on Libre 2 in the U.S. Obviously, we will bring an alarm
version to the U.S. at some point in time. The current version is obviously
doing quite well as well. So that's just another opportunity in the pipeline,
but we have not provided specifics on time line yet.

MILES D. WHITE: I would tell you this. It should take a lot
less time than it seems to. The U.S. lags Europe and the rest of the world on
some of these approvals in a way that I find hard to explain, but it is what it
is.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from
Wells Fargo.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES,
LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: One on capital allocation, one on Nutrition. Miles,
you've been paying down debt. You've been quiet on the M&A front in 2018.
Do you expect that to change in 2019? And I just had one question on Nutrition.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. Let me deal with that one first. Well,
first of all, I think the organization has done a terrific job on cash
generation and debt pay down. And I give Brian Yoor and the management team
total credit for that because what we've done for cash management, debt
management, debt pay down and stuff has been led by him and terrific job. And
to be honest, when we took all the borrowing down in order to do the St. Jude
and Alere acquisitions, our debt to EBITDA ratio was, gosh, I think, like, 4.3,
something like that. And we made commitments to the rating agencies that we
would get that down pretty fast. And we're down to, I think, 2. So we've
obviously paid off a lot of debt very fast. And we're happy with the rate of
that. And it gives us a lot of flexibility from a capital allocation or
strategic flexibly standpoint. But will we continue to pay down debt? We will.
But I think we also -- we have other capital needs, where, for example, we want
to target our dividend in a certain range as a percent of our EPS. And we are
completely able to do that and meet those targets and those goals for dividend
payouts. Some of our capital attention has been paid to growth. And we are
investing in Alinity, and we're investing in Libre. We're making a large
investment in capacity expansion for Libre that, I think, you'll see drive even
more growth out of Libre than you can see now and fulfill kind of the larger
mass market ramp-up we see for that product. We're putting a fair bit of
investment into the expansion of Alinity. So when we can invest our capital in
growth not only near term, but long term with high return, that's a good use
for our capital. And we're obviously doing that. We haven't, to be fair, seen a
lot on the M&A front that interests us. And as I've indicated in the past,
we always keep our ear to the ground. We're always doing our homework on what
possibilities may or may not be out there and what might interest us, what
might fit our portfolio. But right now, we haven't seen anything that draws our
attention that way. So we don't have anything on our radar screen from the
standpoint of M&A that, we think, is beneficial to us. We've got so much
more opportunity in the company organically and out of our pipelines and the
expansion of all the things we've talked about earlier that, that's really
where our focus is. And fortunately, for us, it can be and ought to be. So we
just haven't seen anything to draw our cash or capital investment from the
standpoint of an M&A. I mean, there may be little things here and there, but
nothing that I would say is particularly needle moving on a big scale here in
any near-term way. And then finally, I suppose the fifth, last opportunity is
-- or that I haven't mentioned is not last and priority, but -- is share
buyback. And right now, we haven't been. What you're seeing in our EPS growth
and so forth is pure growth and not enhanced at all by share buybacks. And to
be honest, as we've all seen during the year, that hasn't been a high return
investment for a lot of companies. And we've had better uses for our capital
that do have high returns for us. And so consequently, it doesn't rule it out.
It doesn't rule out that we could do it, but we'll only do it if it's got a
good return for us and our investor, et cetera. And right now, our best investment
is us. So we're directing our cash that way. I think our cash flow is strong
enough that we've got a lot of good choices. We will continue to pay down debt.
But we're at a point where we've got strategic flexibility. It's just a
question on where we'd use it. And I think that's all good.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN: Very clear. And just last for me,
Miles, on Nutrition. A year ago, that was the slowest growing business. That's
clearly turned around. The international Pediatric Nutrition business is doing
really well. Any color on what's going on in China? And lastly, on that, the
Adult Nutrition business in the U.S. has been a little weak recently. Is that
still private label competition? What's the outlook there?

BRIAN B. YOOR: Okay. Yes, I'll take the last first, Larry.
This is Brian. With respect to the U.S., what you're seeing is the impact of a
wind-down of a noncore product line for us. You'll see that here in Q3.
Otherwise, the U.S. business will be growing. You'll see in Q4 as well. It's
noncore to us and it's -- we've just decided to wind it down. That's the only
thing going on in the U.S. With respect to China, the transition is going
smoothly. The food safety law transition is going smoothly. I think behavior
has been rational in the market. The market growth rates in China have been
strong. And we're always fighting there to grow share. But our greater China
business has done quite well this year. And we expect the markets there in
China to remain strong and stable going forward on the pediatric side of the
business.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. I would only add that the whole
Nutrition business, obviously, is doing a lot better this year than it did last
year. Where it is right now, there's various countries or various segments of
business where we want to do better. There's ups and downs. But overall, if you
take it as a whole, a lot happier where it is today than where it was a year
ago.

OPERATOR: Our final question comes from Chris Pasquale from
Guggenheim.

CHRISTOPHER THOMAS PASQUALE, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR ANALYST,
GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to follow up on the FX
commentary and try to make sure we're all on the same page. As we think about
next year, Brian, if rates were to stay where they are right now, what would the
earnings impact from currency be in 2019?

BRIAN B. YOOR: It's going to be somewhere probably between
3% and 4% of our earnings. And we've seen that before. And as Miles said, we
always work to mitigate as much of that as possible. And the great news is that
we have a lot of underlying growth in the businesses and the sales growth that
we're going to power through as much of that as possible.

MILES D. WHITE: And I would add to that, Chris. It always
comes as a judgment trade-off. If you could predict currency for the whole year
or beyond, that would be one thing, but we can't. And so we take a lot of
different actions to mitigate the volatility of it or the impact of it. We've
got a very sophisticated and, frankly, complex rolling hedging program on the
currencies that we can hedge, so we take out a lot of the unpredictability with
that. Obviously, over the long term, we're not currency traders and we're not
trying to be, but we're trying to be able to make our earnings and our sales
more predictable, more stable, more reliable in terms of what our investors
want to see and, frankly, the impact on us, so we can plan and manage. That
said, gosh, today's currency rates, if sustained, it'll be a heavy headwind. Do
I think all of that somehow passes through to the investor? I do not. Do I
think that the currency rates will be the same 3 months from now or the same 6
months from now? I do not. If you ask me, do I think they will be up or down? I
have no idea. All I know is, as I told you earlier, we look at the right
balance of what is right for us to try to mitigate or hedge or whatever we're
going to do to perform to the investment identity that our investors expect of
us and where are we in a prudent range of how we manage that balance and how we
deal with exchange and so forth in the performance for our investors, and we
always start with a double-digit target of growth. So a lot of moving parts,
and we'll see. Right now, I think that's kind of the only elephant in the room
for us. And everything else looks positive and strong and -- or is in our hands
to manage. And the one that's not entirely in our hands to manage is what
currency hands us. But then, we do have a lot of things to do to try to
minimize its impact on the overall performance of the company for our investors.

CHRISTOPHER THOMAS PASQUALE: And Brian, just to make sure
that I'm hearing you correctly. You're saying about $0.10 headwind for next
year, give or take.

BRIAN B. YOOR: It's a range. Exchange currency moves every
day, if you look, 3% to 4%, about that.

CHRISTOPHER THOMAS PASQUALE: Sure. Okay. And then Miles,
just one last one on Alinity in the U.S. What's the latest on the timing there
and when you think you'll have a broad enough menu in place to really make a
big push domestically with that product?

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Chris, this is Scott. I would just
say, as you know, that the clinical chemistry and immunoassay instruments, the
core business there, the instruments are approved. And we are building our test
menu at a pretty ratable kind of rate quarter to quarter, so to speak, and
making progress on that front. It will still take a few more quarters until we
get what we consider a critical mass there. So you'll probably looking back
half of 2019 on what we feel like we're really going to have the menu and the
systems we need to go out and get business.

Okay. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you for all of
your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay
of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's
Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us
today.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any
participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the
entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed
written permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Good
morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice
President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening
remarks, and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail.
Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2018. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological
and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A,
Risk Factors, through our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any
revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or
developments, except as required by law. Please note that second quarter
financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and
line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.

Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth
refers to organic sales growth, which adjusts to 2017 basis of comparison to
exclude the impact of exchange and historical results for Abbott's Medical
Optics and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses, which were divested during
the first quarter of 2017 as well as the current and prior year sales for
Alere, which was acquired on October 3, 2017.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES D. WHITE, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD & CEO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, we reported ongoing
earnings per share of $0.73, above our previous guidance range. We also raised
our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to
$2.85 to $2.91, which now reflects 15% growth at the midpoint. All 4 of our
businesses exceeded expectations in the quarter and contributed to 8% organic
sales growth overall, above our previous guidance range.

Over the past several years, we've executed a very
deliberate strategy of shaping our portfolio, both adding and pruning. At the
same time, we've also invested organically in growth areas that have resulted
in game-changing technologies such as FreeStyle Libre and Alinity. These steps
have created leadership positions in attractive areas in health care, where
innovation makes a big difference for the customers we serve and consequently
for our performance.

The strong results we're achieving are a direct result of
this strategy. Over the past 4 quarters, we've averaged more than 7% organic
sales growth, a true differentiator for a company our size. And with synergies
from recent acquisitions and our focus on margin expansion, we're able to fully
fund our growth opportunities while at the same time, growing earnings
significantly faster than sales. We continue to forecast strong performance for
the remainder of the year, as evidenced by the fact that we're raising our full
year earnings guidance despite the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Clearly, we'd be raising guidance a bit higher if based solely on the
underlying performance of our business.

I'll now summarize our second quarter results before turning
the call over to Brian. I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales
growth of 6.5% in the quarter, including 8% international growth in our core
laboratory business. The pace of our Alinity launch in Europe continues to
accelerate, driven by strong competitive win rates and even stronger retention
rates. This business, which is already a global leader and growing faster than
its market, is well positioned for sustainable growth for years to come as we
capture share and roll out the full suite of Alinity systems across additional
geographies, including the U.S.

In Rapid Diagnostics, second quarter sales were driven by
infectious disease and cardiometabolic testing. The management team has done an
excellent job integrating and stabilizing the business, identifying and realizing
synergies and implementing strategies to drive long-term growth.

In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where we built
leading positions in the fastest-growing pharmaceutical markets in the world,
sales grew more than 12% in the second quarter. EPD continues to execute its
unique strategy and is growing faster than the market in several of its
priority countries, including India and China. Our focus on enhancing the depth
and breadth of our product portfolios and local capabilities continues to
strengthen our position and long-term growth opportunities across these
markets.

In Nutrition, sales increased 6.5% in the quarter, led by
strong performance across our international business. We've now achieved
several consecutive quarters of improving performance for this business.

In Adult Nutrition, growth was led by our market-leading
Ensure and Glucerna brands, most notably internationally, where we saw
double-digit growth.

In Pediatric Nutrition, strong performance was led by
balanced growth across several countries in Asia, including Greater China and
Latin America.

And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew
more than 8%, led by strong double-digit growth in Electrophysiology,
Structural Heart and Diabetes Care.

In Electrophysiology, growth of 22% was led by our advanced
cardiac mapping and ablation portfolio as well as Confirm, the world's first
and only smartphone-compatible insertable cardiac monitor. During the quarter,
we further strengthened our product portfolio in the U.S. with the launch of
our Advisor HD catheter, which includes a first of its kind configuration to
create highly detailed maps of the heart.

In Structural Heart, strong growth across several areas of
our portfolio was led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally
invasive repair of mitral heart valve. Earlier this month, we received U.S. FDA
approval for our next-generation version of MitraClip, which includes design
enhancements and an additional clip size to enable more patients to be treated.

In Vascular, during the quarter, we received FDA approval
for XIENCE Sierra, the newest generation of our leading coronary stent system,
which will enhance our competitiveness in the U.S. market. And we also received
national reimbursement for XIENCE Sierra in Japan during the quarter.

Lastly, in Diabetes Care, sales grew over 30% for the third
consecutive quarter, driven by FreeStyle Libre, our highly differentiated
sensor-based glucose monitoring system. Libre offers a true mass-market
opportunity with its unique combination of affordability, accessibility and
ease of use, and it's achieving a level of patient adoption that's
unprecedented in the industry with more than 800,000 current users globally.

So in summary, this was another very good quarter as we
execute on our strategic priorities. All 4 of our businesses exceeded
expectations for the quarter and contributed strong growth overall. And lastly,
we started the year with strong double-digit EPS guidance. And despite recent
currency shifts, today, we're raising our outlook even higher based on the
strength of our underlying performance.

I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results
and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?

BRIAN B. YOOR, EXECUTIVE VP OF FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all
references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic
basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.

Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter
increased 8% on an organic basis, above our previous guidance range. Sales in
Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired late last year and is therefore not
included in our organic sales growth results, achieved sales of $484 million.

Exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 1.7% on
second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen
versus several currencies, resulting in a less favorable impact on our sales
this quarter compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the
time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the
adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.2% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was
7.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 30.7% of sales.

Turning to our outlook for the full year 2018. Based on our
strong performance and momentum, we're increasing our organic sales growth
forecast to 6.5% to 7.5%. At current exchange rates, we would expect exchange
to have a favorable impact of around 50 basis points on full year reported
sales, which would be around 170 basis points lower than expectations based on
exchange rates in April.

In addition, we continue to expect Rapid Diagnostics to
contribute sales of a little more than $2 billion. We continue to forecast an
adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, which includes
underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We forecast adjusted
R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of
somewhat below 30.5% of sales.

Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2018. We
forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.73 to $0.75. We forecast organic sales growth of
mid- to high single digits. And at current rates, we expect exchange to have a
negative impact of approximately 2% on reported sales.

And in addition, we expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute
sales of approximately $500 million in the third quarter. We forecast an
adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investment
of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales.

Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide an
overview of our third quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For
Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid- to high single-digit sales
growth, which takes into consideration our strong third quarter results last
year when quarterly sales patterns in India were impacted by the implementation
of the new tax system in that country.

In Nutrition, we forecast mid-single-digits growth for the
third quarter and are increasing our full year forecast for 2018 to mid-single
digits as well. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid- to high single-digits sales
growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for
the third quarter and are increasing our full year forecast for 2018 to high
single digits as well, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several
areas of the business.

With that, we will now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question
comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Miles, 2 dynamics that really stand out to us this quarter in addition to,
obviously, the stronger organic number. Just international Nutrition recovery
and obviously, the Libre progression. So can you just give us some details on
sort of the drivers of Nutrition acceleration, the sustainability in the back
half of the year? And then Libre, where it is relative to your plan and your
comfort with maybe $100 million number in U.S. Libre this year, and I had a
quick follow-up.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. In the Nutrition business, I'd say,
first of all, we're pleased with the success in performance. It's across the
board. It's not in any one place. We've been through pretty detailed reviews
and plans by geographic area and so forth. A lot of times, we're talking about
Nutrition in terms of either the U.S. or China. In this case, it's actually not
concentrated that way. It's really across the board in all the countries we're
in. So I'm pretty pleased to see a uniform increase in performance and our
plans taking hold and working in a lot of countries internationally. And like a
lot of things, it's small things and a lot of them in coordination, blocking
and tackling and just doing a better job with our marketing, our positioning in
products and so forth. So as far as sustainability goes, I feel like this
business ought to be able to perform in a, call it, low to mid-single-digit
range on a fairly sustainable basis. And if we can stay in the range we're in,
that's pretty good. I feel pretty good about that. And it's up and down
depending on promotions and given geographic areas from time to time. We'll see
a competitor put on a heavy promotion in something like adult nutrition in the
U.S., and it goes away. Share doesn't change much in that case. But long-term
sustainable growth here. We continue to maintain our position as the market
leader and even advance it in a number of cases. So I feel like it's pretty
solid and look forward to it staying at a, call it, a mid-single-digit level.
With regard to Libre, we can't be anything but pleased. It's going extremely
well. We're on track with where we want to be in terms of patient acquisition
and growth, et cetera. We have nothing to compare us to. No real market
dynamics to compare ourselves to other than the acquisition of patients, and we
expect to go out of the year with over 1 million patients, which is
unprecedented and unseen. We think this is a mass-market sort of a product as
opposed to a very niche-y medical device type product because there are so many
people that are either insulin-dependent or trying not to be insulin-dependent.
And so I think the opportunity here remains enormous. I think the growth is
quite sustainable. There's quite a lot more to do to keep enhancing not only
the product, the offering, the market, so forth. We like the mix of patients
we're getting. We like the geographic mix. We like the geographic advancements.
The reimbursement has been very good. Just about everything about this is going
better than planned. So I think this is one of the key big sustainable growth
drivers of the company, along with the system family Alinity in the diagnostic
area. We got a number of growth drivers here. Either big innovative products
like this or a collection of, call it, smaller innovative niches like we've got
in - a niche is probably, to describe it, too small, but a lot of places where
innovation makes a big difference in medical devices. And then you've got
market growth. And in spite of the volatility at currencies with -- that affect
our pharmaceutical or Nutrition business, the underlying market still had very
strong growth. And I -- so I think all of our growth drivers look very reliable
for the long term.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: All right. And just another quick focus
for me was the neuromod focus for the quarter. I mean, you're kind of
anniversarying some fairly explosive growth in that business. But can you just
discuss the relative change in neuromod growth this quarter, the drivers of it,
what you're doing to address it? And do you believe this portfolio can get back
to market growth?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes, good question. I think you've got a
couple of things going on here, one of which you observed. Explosive growth
last year, which is actually interesting part of the problem, I think this was
a bit of a self-inflicted wound. We did -- this is a business where the
business is very dependent on the involvement of the representative, the sales
representative, et cetera, not only with the physician but also with the
patients. And we did not expand our sales force in concert with the rate of
explosive growth we experienced. And when we finally did expand our sales force
recently, it turns out to be pretty disruptive to do that the way we did it.
And I'd say the issue we created for ourselves was disruption in our own sales
here with the additions of new salespeople and new service people in the field
and so forth. You recut territories, you have a lot of training and so forth. So
I think we've added to our comp issue here. So do I think it gets back to
market growth? Yes, absolutely. I think this is a temporary condition created
by us. It will be fixed by us, and we'll figure out how to successively expand
our sales force in concert with our growth in a, let's just call it a much
smoother fashion in the future. I think we did this to ourselves.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen
from Wells Fargo.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO
SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: So it looks like based on the guidance,
you're forecasting similar growth in the second half once -- adjusting for the
Indian GST benefit that we saw in EPD in the first half. So I guess my question
is, Miles, why do you feel confident you can sustain similar underlying growth
in the second half given that the comps get significantly tougher in the second
half? And I had a follow-up.

MILES D. WHITE: Well, first of all, the underlying dynamics
of our markets underlying are pretty strong. Our single biggest, I guess,
forecastable -- or not forecastable concern, is currency. And I think you're
going to hear that from a lot of companies. I think we're all seeing a stronger
dollar. And in our case, I'll speak for us, we have a significant portion of
our business in high-growth markets, most of which are unhedgeable currencies
and are volatile currencies, emerging markets, et cetera. And we like the
growth and we like the underlying trends and dynamics of those markets, and I
think those have proven to be pretty robust and beneficial. But they also come
with the unpredictable volatility of currency from time to time. So as I said
in my opening remarks, we'd probably be raising guidance even further here, but
for currency headwinds that we see for the remainder of the year. And having
been through this cycle a number of times, you're always cautious about the
second half of the year until you get to about now and see what the currency is
doing because the first half of the year, you think you know what it's going to
do, but you really can't predict that far out. And it's clearly made a big
change since the first quarter. So we've absorbed a fair bit of that negative
currency headwind already, and we'll probably end up absorbing more here in the
second half. But we think we've got a pretty good handle on what we face. But
the underlying dynamics of the real business are all pretty good. Now that
said, things never go exactly like you except them to go. And you take a
business like our pharmaceutical business, it's lumpy. It's got -- if you've
got a year with GST or other factors that create oddball comparables from year
later quarters and so forth, you're automatically going to be lumpy the
following year again. So in a business that has a mix of emerging markets, it's
almost always up-down, up-down, up-down. The good news is even when it's down,
the growth rate is still pretty high. So we go from a good growth rate to a
great growth rate, to a good growth rate back and forth because it's a bit volatile.
One -- last quarter, it was some dynamics in Russia. This quarter, it's
comparables to GST. We'll probably have the same thing because, as you recall,
that created a sequential quarter comparable issue in the EPD business last
year. So we're going to see ups and downs that way in some of these businesses.
And like you guys, our first question is, is there something fundamental about
the performance of the business, the performance of the market? Or have we just
got timing dynamics or volatility dynamics and so forth? The underlying growth
rates in EPD remain very strong across our collection of emerging markets. So I
think we tend to look at it that way. We address everything we see. I think
we're going to see ups and downs here in a lot of these businesses. Look, we
see neuromod at a slower growth rate this quarter, as David just pointed out.
Do I think the underlying growth dynamics of that market are somehow
unattractive? Absolutely not. That market remains very attractive. And do I
think we'll do well in it? Yes, we'll do really well in it. But next year,
we'll be referring back to this quarter from a comparable standpoint and so
forth. So I am quite confident that what I see in the underlying trends of each
of these businesses is pretty good. I'm very pleased with Nutrition, very
pleased with the acceleration in Alinity, in Diagnostics. I'm pleased with the
steady ramp, which only gets better and better with Libre. And those are big,
big growth drivers across the board. So while they may go up and down a couple
of percentage points here and there, the underlying overall growth rate is
pretty strong. And like I said earlier, we'll probably raise guidance further,
but for the concern about exchange.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN: That's helpful. And then for my
follow-up, I had to follow up on David's question. Within med tech, there was
some pockets of strength like Diabetes and Electrophysiology, but there were a
couple of soft spots, like CRM. You've already addressed Neuromodulation and
Heart Failure. So any more color on CRM and Heart Failure, how we should be
thinking about those segments in the second half of the year?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes, there's a couple of dynamics going on
with CRM. That one gets a fair amount of my attention, I would tell you. First
of all, we got a little bit of a tough comparison to last year because we
launched the low-voltage MRI-compatible products then and obviously, had
stocking dynamics in the second quarter and so forth. But beyond that, there's
also sort of an underlying battery replacement timing thing going on here
because when St. Jude, prior to us in '15, '16, had its battery issues, it
pulled forward a lot of replacements and -- to replace those batteries. And so
you see fewer replacements now because they were pulled forward. Whereas, in
the de novo segment, where we got new patients, we're doing extremely well. So
when you kind of take it apart, you look at it and say, "Well, if we're
right about our diagnosis and analysis here, we should see this pick up in the
future with a bit of a tailwind once we get past this replacement phenomenon
relative to 2016." So we've looked at that. I think for the rest of this
year, we're probably flat in CRM, but that's not a satisfactory position for
us. So my expectation is we keep improving the growth rate here. We're not
happy with what the growth rate looks like, but we think we understand why.
With regard to Electrophysiology and others, geez, they're doing great, as you
pointed out. Heart Failure, we need a destination therapy claim, and I think
we're going to be in great shape. I think it's that simple.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from
Bank of America.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFA MERRILL
LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just have 2, one kind of big picture and one on a
divisional level. From a big picture perspective, I think you guys have been
very clear on the topic of durable revenue growth. I have a question on durable
earnings growth. And the reason I ask the question is that your earnings growth
has obviously been running well above your targets. As we go forward, if you're
successful in driving the kind of revenue growth you think you can drive in
this business, what does a durable earnings growth outlook look like for the
company? Is it closer to 15% than 10%? Just any thoughts on that topic would be
appreciated.

MILES D. WHITE: Many times in these calls, somebody tries to
get me to forecast future earnings growth, and I think we start every year with
a goal of, in fact, even a long term of double-digit earnings growth. And that
-- you might say, well, that sort of backs you into 10% or 9.999% or whatever.
And we don't necessarily hit it every single year, but pretty darn close. In
some years, it's a lot more than that. So I would tell you that our overall
strategy is we want to grow at a double-digit rate. Otherwise, difficult to
call yourself a growth company. We got a lot of pieces in this company. We've
tried to position it in growth markets, growth segments, growth products, innovative
areas and so forth. And we also have some extremely profitable cash-generating
legacy businesses that grow slower, but they're still growth. And those
businesses, we do look for incremental growth and the kind of delivery of
profit that's above the sales growth rate. And overall, that mix has to deliver
that double-digit target for us, which is why we've shaped the company as we
have over the last 6 years to add growth and prune away some things that may
not fit us over the long term. We've tried to put ourselves in the right
geographic markets, the right innovative spaces, the right growing health care
areas and so forth so -- we've talked about. So -- and we always look for
leverage on the bottom line by improvements in margin, gross margin, even our
spending efficiency and so forth. So I don't know that I can predict whether
it's 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%. But I can tell you, we start every year with
the presumption, that's our identity, that's our hallmark, that's the mix of
our businesses, that's the mix of our products. And we build our product
strategies and business strategies to deliver that. There's a lot of things
that change, as you know, over the course of the year. A year never goes quite
like you expect it to go. And I'm eliminating exchange for a minute here, even
just the dynamics of markets, trade, whatever it may be, new product approvals
or delays, et cetera. So we got a lot of moving parts. And I think that as a
mix of businesses, we've got a really robust, strong, powerful mix of innovative,
profitable businesses. We're in a really great new product cycle of launches.
Every piece of this has a nice, sustainable long term ahead of it here. And the
businesses, you can see the evidence of it growing. So beyond that, I'm not
sure I can predict more accurately for you what it's going to be other than we
put a lot of growth drivers here. We're not organically getting a lot of growth
out of the Alere business this year, as you know, because we're settling that
in, but I'm really pleased with its performance. It's above our expectations.
And we haven't even begun to see how that's going to deliver for us in the
coming years. So I just look at the way we're managing the delivery of the
various pieces of our business. We always got a lot of shots on goal here and a
lot of products to expand. So I'd tell you, our goal is always double digits.
And beyond that, I'm not ready to tell you how many double digits for next
year.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS: Fair enough. But I appreciate the
detailed answer. And then one other thing I wanted to touch on really quickly
was just if there's one business that seems like it's really done better than
you thought at the beginning of the year, it's maybe nutritionals. So I was
wondering if you could just talk about what's driven the improvement and how
sustainable that is.

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I think I'll go back to there's no one
thing. Our markets are all a little different. You'd think that infant formula
and Ensure wouldn't be that complicated, but it actually is at some level. And
the dynamics of each market are a little different. And some -- we've got, in
some ways, the same multinational competitors in most of our geographies, but
even they don't have the same strategies or even the same products in every market.
And then there's always a lot of local or regional competitors. And in a
country like Vietnam, we had a very strong state competitor there in Vinamilk.
A fine company, and they execute very well. They happen to be really strong in
rural areas. We happen to be very strong in big cities. That's a dynamic that's
unique to Vietnam. The dynamics we face in the Middle East or other markets in
Asia are different. It's -- so it's no one thing, I'm afraid. We can try all
those consultant 4-box matrices to sort of say all of these countries are like
this and put them in the upper left-hand corner box and so on. But even doing
that, that's artifice. It's -- each country is a little different. I'd say,
overall, we needed to improve several things. The focus of our products. You
can have too many. You can have too few. But you got to have certain ones, you
got to have certain innovations, you got to have certain ingredients, and you
got to have marketing that appeals to the consumers and/or physicians or
hospitals that you're trying to appeal to. It's a little tailored to each
market. We literally went country by country, call it, top 15 countries and
went through a detailed analysis and new strategies and so forth. You say,
well, "Was there a lot of management change?" Actually, not. In a few
places, yes, but not that many. It's really us and our execution, and we took
that bar up and it shows. It shows. We've got a pretty strong business there. I
think we slipped off the rail a little bit for a while. And I'm pleased to see
that the top management, which -- some of which is new, has established pretty
good direction for each of the major geographies now. And beyond that, it gets
to be a lot of little details that you got to execute better. We've seen a lot
of channel change. We've seen a huge impact of online or digital marketing,
digital shipment, et cetera, as channels. We've seen specialized channels of
all baby stores and so forth. We've -- so we've -- I think we were slow to
adjust and adapt to that. I think others did it faster than we did, and we got
left behind. We now understand what we missed. We understand what we needed to
do about it. And we've either done it or we're doing it, and it clearly shows
and makes a difference. So I think we had to be pretty honest with ourselves
about mistakes we'd made or things we'd missed. And now we're correcting that
with a vengeance and running hard here. So I think the execution is a lot
better.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Glenn Novarro
from RBC Capital Markets.

GLENN JOHN NOVARRO, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Miles, 2 questions on Libre. First, can you give us a little
bit more color on the U.S. rollout and where you are with commercial coverage?
And are you still comfortable with your Libre guidance for the year, which, in
the U.S., I think is $90 million to $100 million? And then I had a follow-up.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. A real quick answer to that, yes, we're
absolutely comfortable with the guidance for the year. I'd -- we're on track,
Glenn. It's -- yes, I'd like to go even faster. As I've said before, we're even
investing heavily in capacity expansion and so forth to anticipate even greater
growth in the future. And I -- it's -- there's really nothing to compare it to.
There's -- I think the whole space is getting increasing attention. And we
have, as you know, carved out a very economic position that's extremely
profitable for us, but we're in a very, let's call it, economically accessible
price point, which has made the uptake and the reception by the patient or the
consumer or even reimbursing bodies pretty attractive. And I think we found a
real value proposition point here with the product. Our manufacturing is
extremely automated. It gives us a big advantage in terms of cost. And
everything is kind of working well here. I'm pretty excited about this product.
This -- it's got so much potential because I think a lot of times, whether it's
a pharmaceutical or medical device, et cetera, they can be expensive in the
health care system for recovery of cost and so forth because the numbers of
patients may not be that great. And yet, there's a lot of diabetics in the
world, including me. And there's millions that are insulin-dependent and
millions that don't want to be insulin-dependent, et cetera. This product hits
the sweet spot. And to be a mass-market product, it's got to be accessible.
It's got to be affordable. And it's got to be affordable in a way that it's not
hard for people to commit to it, use it and find out what it can do for them
and so forth. So I'd say that's all going super. We like the split we're seeing
of type 1s versus type 2s. We're probably globally about 2/3 type 1s and 1/3
type 2s. I think that's a pretty good mix, and it speaks to the clinical
efficacy and the benefits of the products and the 2 different types of users
that benefit from it. So at this point, it's all about how fast can we run. And
I think the uptake by consumers, the retention, the repeat, all that, all of
our data says this is going well. And as I indicated to you, we'll go out at
the end of the year with more than 1 million patients worldwide, a significant
number in the U.S. I think we'll probably be -- well, we are so far and away
the global leader in this space now. It's almost -- there's no way to kind of
look at share. We've looked at, what you call, sensor days. How many -- if you
take the sensors, numbers of patients, whatever, and how many days of testing
you get out of that, we're already well above 90% globally. And it's -- there's
nothing to compare to. It's -- and it's a huge market. So I think that just the
opportunity here -- we're comparing to us and how fast we can run. And that's
really an exciting product, I'll say. It's nice to see a product that has that
kind of impact, and this one is just fun. It's just fun.

GLENN JOHN NOVARRO: And then let me just one quick
follow-up. Can you discuss what's next in terms of features for Libre and
timing?

MILES D. WHITE: I could, but I'm probably going to -- I'm
probably not going to set any expectations around that because I don't want to
create trigger points or talking points or whatever -- catalyst. I don't know
all the terms you guys like to use. There are a number of things that we have
planned in place, done the work, et cetera, for enhancements to the product,
obvious ones, some of which are already available overseas. It's a little
different challenge working through the FDA here in this country. And so I
don't want to get into the space, but -- or the discussion. But yes, we got
plenty of enhancements and thoughts here for advancing the product still
further, Glenn.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Rick Wise from
Stifel.

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE, MD & SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH
ANALYST, STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe
starting off with a big picture question. You, in some of your earlier
comments, sort of lightly touched on this. But when we think about your
priorities right now, should we imagine that you're focused, now that
everything is coming along, should we expect you to be largely focused just on
continued execution with the portfolio you have? Or do you think the portfolio
is in good shape as it exists? Or are you thinking about not just M&A? And
of course, I'm always interested in hearing about your interest in
opportunistically adding technology or inorganic growth. But with your existing
portfolio, are you more -- now more aggressively looking at the pieces you have
and thinking you might be more actively thinking about trading out, the net benefit
of which would be to enhance growth and/or margin? Both ways, in and out.

MILES D. WHITE: I get this question in one form or another
on every call and every visit to investors and so forth, and it's always a fun,
speculative question. But the honest answer is, look, I think we did some very
deliberate shaping of the company, let's say, since the AbbVie split over the
last 6 years. And that's not been accidental or reactive or opportunistic. It's
been with intent and a plan and so forth. At this point, I also think companies
can get a little too transactionally oriented. Everything is a transaction as
opposed to you got to run it and run it well. So philosophically, here's how we
operate. Our first baseline is we've got to operate and execute well organically
as a company. I know it's a word we've used a lot today, but I want to make a
distinction between what we do as part of the ongoing operating of the company
versus transactions one way or the other. And our whole goal has been to
establish the company with its own internal growth drivers, productive R&D,
productive innovation, productive positioning in the right markets, the right
segments, the right growth things because our investors expect us to make them
money and do well with their investment and grow the company. So we position
ourselves pretty deliberately and intentionally in those kinds of spaces across
the board. I don't know that you're ever done and I don't know that you ever
feel totally comfortable. You shouldn't, but I think we're in a pretty good
place that way. We've got a lot of what I would say was our intentional
repositioning done. That means for us that we got to integrate it all. We've
pretty much done that. I mean, the integrations of St. Jude and Alere, pretty
well done. I mean, it's finished. There's not -- other than capturing synergies
as we go and establishing R&D pipelines where they may not have existed and
so forth, speaking primarily of Alere, they are not St. Jude because St. Jude
has got a robust pipeline. Those kinds of things, it's all about the ongoing
delivery of new technologies, new products, new innovations, improvements in
the ones you have and so on. So over these last 6 to 8 years, those R&D
pipelines and everything have been well established, not just within Abbott but
within St. Jude, too. So we like the hand we're holding. And that means you got
to make sure that, as a baseline, you can deliver your company's strategic
goals. And in our case, it does. So that means any transaction for us becomes
opportunistic. And does that opportunity fit us strategically? Is it something
we're prepared to react or respond to? We'd like to be in a position where it's
a choice, not a necessity per se. And I think that's where we are. And right
now, we've said, for this period of time, because we took on a lot of debt to
conclude the St. Jude and Alere acquisitions, we wanted to pay down that debt.
Well, we're way ahead of schedule paying down our debt, as you know. And
shortly here, we'll -- we wanted to pay back $8 billion this year. We're just
about there. And we'll be there well before year-end in terms of debt paydown
because we've had really good cash management, really good cash flow, et
cetera. We've been able to pay a dividend. We'll raise our dividend at some
point. We'll have a steady march with our dividend, like we always do. We've
been able to fund the capital expenditures internally that drive our growth in
our business. We've got some heavy capital investment right now in both Libre
and Alinity, and I anticipate that will continue to be the case. But it's not
an affordability issue for us. So I think our priorities in terms of cash use
and investment internally, we're easily making. We're easily making those
goals. So we can afford to be opportunistic if something attractive comes
along, but I would tell you that I haven't seen anything that compels me or is
sitting on the edge of our radar screen at this point. The single biggest
opportunities we've got are all in our own pipelines and in our businesses now
and in the markets we're in. The biggest opportunities we've got are right in
front of you. The question is, how big and how fast and those trends -- what we
think we see going forward looks awfully attractive. And if at some point,
well, how far would you take debt down? How far would you pay down debt? What
are you going to do when you hit the point where you think that, that's enough?
And I think there's a couple of answers to that. A lot of people seem to get
comfortable somewhere between $15 billion and $20 billion. I remember with $15
billion of debt, still a hell of a lot of debt. And so I think -- and I also
observe, as many of us have, I think you analysts as well, share buybacks right
now aren't particularly economic. And they're not paying off all that well in
the market. So you try to make your moves at prudent times. I think right now,
prudence for us, we've got -- we always have our periscope up looking at what's
on the reader screen out there. I think there's places in Medical Devices and
other things where we might opportunistically think there's something that
would be a nice addition to our portfolio. But I don't think anybody should be
holding their breath waiting for a great big move here. I like the portfolio
we've got. I'm always questioned about the portfolio because everybody wants to
help me tweak it, but it's a pretty strong portfolio because all the businesses
are operating well. And for the most part, they're at the early stages of
growth cycles driven by new product innovations and technology innovations and
so forth that are pretty healthy. Because we've got a higher index in emerging
markets than a lot of companies, we're going to endure that bumpy road, but the
underlying development of those economies in health care systems has been a big
plus for us, both for pharma and nutrition. And honestly, it is in devices and
diagnostics, too. There are some of those markets that don't economically work
in those businesses, but some do. So I think our platter right now says we can
afford to just be opportunistic. I don't have big M&A on the radar screen
or big transactions on the radar screen. I'd say from a capital or cash
allocation standpoint, I'm going to keep paying down debt because I think
that's a prudent path for now. I always like having maximum strategic
flexibility for the company. I think our path here is clear. We've been prudent
about when it's good to buy back shares and when it isn't. I think our capital
allocation has been pretty good. And the good news is we got plenty of cash and
capital to have choice, and we can afford to be that discretionary about it.
There's a constant stream of friendly investment bankers in and out always
telling us what's coming on the radar screen, so I don't think we're missing
anything. And right now, I like our portfolio a lot better than I like somebody
else's.

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE: Yes. Appreciate that comprehensive
answer. Just last for me. You had a couple of notable...

MILES D. WHITE: That means I talk too much, right, Rick?

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE: I would never say that, Miles. No,
really, it was very helpful. You had a couple of notable new product approvals
this quarter, the next-gen MitraClip and XIENCE Sierra. XIENCE Sierra is coming
in the context to a vascular business that did slightly worse this quarter than
the first quarter. Structural Heart, obviously, incredibly strong, accelerated.
Just -- so maybe a little color on what we should think for MitraClip. Does the
bigger reach open up more procedures? Does it accelerate growth? Does XIENCE Sierra
get you back on track in Vascular? I'll stop there.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. Sure, thanks for the question, Rick.
Yes, I think MitraClip definitely opens up to more patients just because of the
size changes and so forth that we've got more flexibility with that product.
And any time you can do incremental improvements of products and enhance them
further, you're extending their reach, extending their life, their -- the
competitiveness, et cetera. So I think all that's good for our Structural Heart
business, and then we got more things in our pipeline coming. The XIENCE
Sierra, okay, early returns in Europe. Excellent and performance excellence. I
think same with Japan. We've just launched in the United States, so all I've
got is anecdotal feedback. The U.S. and Japan and Europe, they're not the same,
but they're close. So I expect Sierra to do well in the United States. When you
say, "Will it get you back on the track?" I think the track in the
stent business is the low single digits at best. I don't think -- there's
always a lot of competition in this business. We've talked about that. There's
3 or 4 pretty strong competitors here. I think the market has kind of said,
look, the multitude -- the magnitude or the base magnitude of innovation has
been had. There's incremental improvements we can all make, but it's a very
competitive space. So I think being on track here is low single digit. And
that's at least right now what I'd kind of expect out of this. And I expect
XIENCE Sierra to claim its share of the market, do well, be more than
competitive, and we'll see that. We're seeing it in Europe. We're seeing it in
Japan. So I expect to see it in the U.S., too. But I don't think this is a
space where there's gigantic quantum leaps in offerings. But it's one of those
very strong, very profitable important legacy cornerstones of the device
business that's important for us to maintain our leadership in and our
competitive position in. And I think XIENCE Sierra definitely kind of puts us
back on that track.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch
from BMO Capital Markets.

JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH, MD & RESEARCH ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL
MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Can we spend a moment or 2 looking at the Diagnostic
business? Alinity has been launched in Europe for over a year. It's rolling out
in the United States now. How should we think about that contributing and also
the whole business holistically now that Alere is part of it?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, Joanne, Alere is part of the
Diagnostics business, but it's not integrated in the core lab business. What we
got here is kind of a collection of businesses by major segments. So I think --
and let me just take that last part first. I think the space that Alere expands
us in, point of care and your patient testing, distributed testing, et cetera,
which is also kind of a collection of spaces, I think we're in a very strong
position. One of the things we'd like to do, obviously, is renew or update or
enhance a number of products and so forth, and others put a lot more in
innovation and R&D there. But we've got, I think, a very, very strong
portfolio. Right now, I'd call it a stable portfolio that's at a low growth
point, but that's not where we ultimately expect it to be. And since the time
we acquired Alere, we've said for a while here, that's not going to be a high
grower, but we expect it to be, and we do. And I'd tell you that so far,
everything that you'd have to do to integrate a business, make it part of the
company, put management in place that hasn't been there before, and so that's
all gone exceptionally well, way faster than we might have thought. So we're
really pleased with that business. We're really pleased with it in the
portfolio. We're super pleased with how the management team there is doing. All
good. All good all day, and we look forward to its contribution to our growth
and innovation over the future here because I think that's exactly what it's
going to do. Back to Alinity, there's a couple of things to kind of understand
about this space or spaces. We don't always determine when the customer wants
to buy or when the customer has to make a decision. So first of all, because
these are big mainframe systems, core laboratories, blood screening,
enterprises and so forth, they tend to be contracted or tenders that are 5, 7
or even 10 years. They're usually longer-term contracts. They're big
installations. The change from one competitor to another, old systems, new
systems, so forth, it's not quick. It'll take a couple of months and so forth.
So these are big mainframe sorts of enterprise decisions, and we're kind of on
their schedule. So we can do a lot to enhance that or even speed it up, which
we're doing. The receptiveness to something new, if you're replacing old
systems, depends on the completeness of your menu so that you can do a full
swap-out and not have to run 2 different systems at the same time, et cetera,
even though a lot of labs do. So those are just dynamics we deal with in the
market every day. I'd say our menu in Europe is full and robust. It's a big
menu in the U.S. and other countries. Not as big as Europe, but coming fast.
And we're talking anywhere from 150 to 200 different tests here that have to be
on that box, each of which have to be individually approved and licensed, et
cetera. So that's -- we're in a really strong position that way in Europe. That
menu ramp-up obviously takes a little bit of time. It takes a little bit of
time in the U.S. and everywhere. So we're getting through that or past that
now. The -- we're tracking, like you would in any capital business, prospects,
which I think has more than, gosh, quintupled in the last several quarters
here. And we're tracking close rates. If we're in a competitive situation where
we are already in there, I think our win rate is about 97%. I mean, we're
keeping everything that we've already got and then expanding beyond that. In
places where we're trying to replace competitive systems, our win rate is well
above 50%, and that's really good. From the standpoint of -- those accounts
have to make a decision that they're actually going to swap out everything that
they've had for a number of years. And to have that kind of initial win rate
here is pretty strong. And so we like the win rates we're seeing both in
retention and new instruments and new placements and expansions and so forth.
And a lot of times, you'll get the first installation, then it expands from
there. So I would say, all the metrics that we would track, including how fast
it is to get up and running, test the record and so forth, they're all tracking
exceptionally well. We're expanding our sales and service organizations in
Europe as we speak. That hiring is going very well and very fast. It's a lot
better than we did in neuromod, I can tell you that. We'll take a lesson there.
And so the ramp-up is moving faster and faster now. We've got a very
specifically detailed plan about how many, how fast, on what pace, et cetera,
gosh, for years ahead here. And we've pretty well got every country mapped,
every account mapped, et cetera. So now it's just a question of execution and
how fast we can execute, and all that's doing really well. So I'm pretty
excited about the path ahead here in the Diagnostics business on all fronts.

JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH: And my follow-up question is on your
MitraClip franchise. We have the next generation product, which was just
FDA-approved, and the COAPT trial reading out in September. Can you just give
us an update on where that business is?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. I'm going to ask Scott to help me with
that, Joanne.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Yes. With respect to MitraClip, you
can see the performance in the numbers there, and Structural Heart is doing
quite well. We will get a read-out rate out on the U.S. COAPT trial data later
this year, very likely at the TCT Conference in September. So that will be a
big event for us. We're also doing quite a bit with respect to geographic
expansion as well. We received national reimbursement in Japan here in the
second quarter. That's a nice opportunity for us, too. That market is quite
sizable. So MitraClip is hitting on all cylinders with a lot of growth in front
of it.

MILES D. WHITE: So Joanne, I'd wrap up. I like the way Scott
wrapped that up. It's hitting on all cylinders. Obviously, in a company our
size and diversity, everything doesn't hit on all cylinders all the time. But
I'd say right now, I think for the markets we have and let's call it, the
exchange and the currency volatility we've all got out there and so on, I think
the company is performing exceptionally well and feel pretty good about all the
underlying performance and the strength going forward here.

OPERATOR: And our final question comes from Chris Pasquale
from Guggenheim.

CHRISTOPHER THOMAS PASQUALE, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR ANALYST,
GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Miles, just a couple quick ones
here for me. One on the EPD business and the situation in Russia, I think you
had previously said you still expected that to be a headwind in 2Q. Did that
come back earlier than expected? And then just quickly on Diagnostics, the
legacy Abbott Point of Care business has slowed a little bit over the last few
quarters. Is that a function of the integration work being done there? Or is
there something else happening?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, let me take the Point of Care first.
Yes, there's a couple things going on there, and I'd say a little bit of it in
integration. We had a number of management changes because we were populating
the new Rapid Diagnostics business. So we had a lot of new over new over new
there, and we may have lost touch with ourselves a little bit in the
transition. And yes, there's a couple customer dynamics, big accounts and so
forth, where we had some challenges that have since been addressed. So I expect
that to improve. I don't think that's a long-term condition. But yes, we've had
a couple of, let's just call it, slip-ups here that slowed our growth rate. And
I think we'll be seeing that come back to much healthier growth rate. With
regard to Russia and EPD, I'm going to get a little bit of help here from Scott
and Brian. But generally, I'd say, look, yes, it's as predicted. I think it's
-- we're seeing the cycle pass through here in the second quarter, but I don't
know that it's completely done. But everything we kind of thought would play out
is or has. And so we're seeing that come back to, let's call it, a better
position. You guys can add anything.

BRIAN B. YOOR: Yes. I would just add, our end customer
demand remains in line with our expectations. We're tracking that. And I'd say,
this quarter, we actually returned to growth in Russia, which is a good sign
based on the stabilization we're seeing and how the destocking has progressed
as we had planned thus far.

MILES D. WHITE: I'm actually kind of surprised we got it
that close. Usually, you try to break these things and you're never right. And
it's actually turned out to be more right than we thought.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Well, thank you, operator, and thank
you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A
webcast replay of the call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today
on Abbott Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for
joining us today.

OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating
in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any
participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the
entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed
written permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Good
morning and thank you for joining us.

With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and
Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will
discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments,
Miles, Brian and I will take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2018. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological
and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A,
Risk Factors, through our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Abbott undertakes no obligation
to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of
subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that
first quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales,
EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.

Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth
refers to organic sales growth, which adjusts the 2017 basis of comparison to
exclude the impact of exchange and historical results for Abbott's Medical
Optics and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses, which were divested during
the first quarter of 2017, as well as the current and prior years sales for
Alere, which was acquired on October 3, 2017.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES D. WHITE, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD & CEO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning.

Today, we reported the results of a very strong quarter.
Ongoing earnings per share were $0.59 at the high end of our guidance range and
reflecting 23% growth. Sales increased 7% on an organic basis in the quarter,
led by continued strong growth in Medical Devices and improving performance in
our Nutrition business. Our full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance
of $2.80 to $2.90 remains unchanged and reflects mid-teens growth at the
midpoint. Back in January, I commented that we were entering the year with
strong momentum, which has continued as we forecasted. Strong growth we're
achieving is a direct result of the steps we've taken to position the company
in the most attractive areas of health care as well as the outstanding
productivity of our new product pipeline.

I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning
the call over to Brian, and I'll start with diagnostics where we achieved sales
growth of 5.5% in the quarter. We remain focused on accelerating the launch of
our new Alinity systems in Europe where we've made good progress on test menu
expansion and where we're seeing increasing competitive win rates. Diagnostics
has been our most consistent growth business over the past several years, and
Alinity is a highly differentiated platform which will build upon that strong
track record for years to come.

In Rapid Diagnostics, which we created in the fourth quarter
of last year with the acquisition of Alere, we achieved sales of nearly $560
million, somewhat ahead of our expectations and partially due to the strong flu
season in the United States. This is a very attractive area of diagnostics
testing and our integration of this business into Abbott continues to go well
as we put in place the building blocks to drive sustainable growth and margin
expansion.

In Nutrition, sales increased more than 4.5% in the quarter,
marking the fifth consecutive quarter of improving performance. Sales growth
this quarter was balanced across our Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses.
In Pediatric Nutrition, above-market growth in the U.S. was led by Similac, our
leading infant formula brand. Internationally, performance improved across
several countries and we continued to see stable market conditions in China
following the implementation of a new food safety -- of new food safety
regulations in that country at the beginning of this year. In Adult Nutrition,
sales growth was led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands in both
the U.S. and internationally.

In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales growth of 7%
was led by double-digit growth in India, China and Brazil. Our unique branded
generics model was built to focus specifically on key emerging countries with
socioeconomic and competitive conditions that provide a favorable environment
for long-term growth. We serve each of these markets with a broad product
offering tailored to address local needs. This unique and successful approach
positions EPD to continue delivering superior performance in the
fastest-growing pharmaceutical markets in the world.

And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices where sales grew
nearly 10%, led by strong growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart,
Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care. In Electrophysiology, growth of 19% was led
by market uptake of several recently launched products, including our EnSite
Precision cardiac mapping system and Confirm, the world's first and only
smartphone compatible insertable cardiac monitor which helps physicians
remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias.

The first quarter

(technical difficulty)

by our market-leading portfolio, which includes several
recently launched products that offer improved relief for patients suffering
from chronic pain and movement disorders.

I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care where sales grew over 30% in
the quarter, driven by FreeStyle Libre, our highly differentiated sensor-based
glucose monitoring system. Libre now has over 650,000 users across the globe
which represents an unprecedented level of patient adoption in the industry. As
we've discussed previously, we're investing significant capital to expand
manufacturing capacity which will allow us to meet anticipated demand over the
coming years. Libre offers a true mass-market opportunity with its unique
combination of affordability, accessibility and ease-of-use, and we're positioning
ourselves to maximize its impact.

So in summary, as expected, the momentum we carried into the
year has continued as reflected by our strong first quarter results. We
continue to see significant growth contributions from a number of recently
launched products across our portfolio and we're well positioned to achieve our
financial objectives for the year, including top-tier sales growth and
mid-teens EPS growth, as we continue to make investments to sustain our growth
momentum into the future.

I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results
and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?

BRIAN B. YOOR, EXECUTIVE VP OF FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Okay. Thanks, Miles.

And as Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all
references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic
basis, which is consistent with the guidance we provided back in January.

Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter
increased 6.9% on an organic basis and exchange had a positive impact of 4.2%
on sales. The favorable impact of exchange rates on sales this quarter was
driven primarily by strengthening of the euro and other developed market
currencies which considering our cost base and hedging program, has minimal
fall-through and impact on our earnings.

Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross
margin ratio was 59.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.4% of sales
and adjusted SG&A expense was 33.2% of sales, all in line with our previous
guidance.

Turning to our outlook. For the full year 2018, we continue
to forecast organic sales growth of 6% to 7%. And based on current rates, we
expect exchange to have a favorable impact of a little more than 2% on full
year reported sales with more than half of this impact driven by strengthening
of the euro. In addition, we continue to expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute
sales of a little more than $2 billion. We continue to forecast an adjusted
gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, reflecting underlying gross
margin improvement across our businesses. Adjusted R&D investment of around
7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 30.5% of sales.

Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2018. We
forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.70 to $0.72. We forecast organic sales growth of
6% to 7% and at current rates, would expect exchange to have a positive impact
of a little below 3% on reported sales. In addition, we expect Rapid
Diagnostics to contribute sales of approximately $500 million in the second
quarter. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59% of sales,
adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A
expense of somewhat above 30.5% of sales.

Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide an
overview of our second quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For
Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast double-digit sales growth. In
Nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics, we
forecast a modest sequential improvement in sales growth of around 6%. And in
Medical Devices, we forecast sales to increase mid to upper single digits,
which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of the business.

With that, we will now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question
comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.

MICHAEL NEIL WEINSTEIN, SENIOR MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ANALYST
AND HEAD OF HEALTHCARE GROUP, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Let
me start, if I can, on a couple of product launches. I was hoping you could
provide some additional color on how the U.S. launches are going for both Libre
and Confirm. And then second, the EPD business had a slightly weaker quarter
this quarter than was expected. Brian commented in the second quarter guidance
that he expects the business to rebound to double digits in the second quarter.
So if you can just call out if there -- anything in particular that might have
impacted the first quarter that you would view as one-time in nature.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. Thanks for the question, Mike. And
before I go into those answers, I'd like to take a minute and just acknowledge
you as an analyst in our space for just the terrific job you've done over the
years and acknowledge your change of career. We won't have you on these calls
anymore, but you've always had great questions and you always hit the right
points. And good luck to you in whatever you're going to do and we'll miss you
here.

MICHAEL NEIL WEINSTEIN: Thank you, Miles.

MILES D. WHITE: Let's start with Libre. The Libre launch,
I'd say, has gone exceptionally well at the -- and is going exceptionally well.
We obviously expected to keep going exceptionally well worldwide. As I
mentioned, we're up to over 650,000 patients at this point. We're adding over
50,000 patients a month. We added about 150,000 just over that this last
quarter. So if I look at the acquisition rate of patients, we expect to
obviously be over 1 million patients at year-end and trending in a pretty
healthy fashion. And then, I'm pretty gratified by that growth. It's true
globally and I'd say in terms of color, the mix of patients is very strong. Our
reimbursement is -- I think we're reimbursed at about 2/3 of all sales now
internationally. That's strong. We keep getting reimbursement approvals in
countries. I think that the value proposition of Libre, the affordability is
particularly strong and appealing to patients as well as the performance,
ease-of-use of the product and so forth. We get a lot of feedback that way. About
2/3 of the patient base are type 1 diabetics and about 1/3 are type 2 patients.
So we've got -- we're seeing validation of the appeal and use of the product in
both segments. We're investing a significant amount of capital in capacity
expansion, anticipating that the growth legs on this product are going to be
long because it's got a real mass-market appeal and fit. And there are, as you
know, tens of million of diabetics and tens of millions of insulin-using
diabetics, the majority of which are actually international. And in our case so
far, the vast majority of our patients are international, but we're off to a
strong start in the U.S. as well. At this point, we're a little over 50,000
patients in the U.S. and trending strong. And I think as far as starts go and
continuations and expansions and so forth, I guess that's all good news. So
we're running hard and the reception of patients here and abroad has been
exceptional. I think that the opportunity in the category is quite large. And
the category gets a lot of attention and for us is a future growth driver. We
think it's pretty strong. I'm not sure what other detail to fill in, but nice
thing is it's the kind of growth challenge you like to have, we are not having
to overinvest in SG&A because the customers are our strongest marketers.
And given social media and so forth, that's been a huge plus. So everything
about it is doing really well. And I think we'll see this be a major growth
driver for the company for quite a long time. With regard to Confirm, also off
to a strong start. The -- we're capturing share, physician feedback has been
very positive. It's a simple procedure. And I think one of the appeals, it is
the only device that is smartphone compatible. It's a nice market opportunity
and it's been a nice bump up in the growth rate. I know there's competition out
there, there's competition in every category we're in and competition always
makes you pay attention to innovation and next steps and next improvements and
so forth. And I suspect we'll see response to the success of this product but
in the meantime, doing quite well. And then finally, EPD. You know it falls
into the category for me of it's always something. And given the focus on --
whether it's emerging or high-growth markets, we seem to have a given market
that affects our EPD or even our Nutrition business from time to time
somewhere. And in this particular case, it's Russia. And in the case of Russia,
the market has been -- the market growth rate has been slowing. We still see
that in our IMS data and so forth. As you know, we have 2 businesses in EPD
there, the EPD brand and the Veropharm brand. The Veropharm brand has withstood
that slowing market growth rate far better than the EPD brand because a lot of
it is hospital-based whereas the EPD brand is more pharmacy-based. There's been
a lot of expansion on pharmacies, but that doesn't mean that there's expansion
of prescriptions. And so the overall market, I think, is one of temporary
distribution channel dynamics as those pharmacies expanded. And that has now
ceased to -- at that rate. And the market, I think, will stabilize in terms of
distribution channels, outlets and so forth. But that's created a little
disruption in that market temporarily. And that's all this is -- is that in Russia.
And without Russia, we'd be in the 8.5% to 9% range as a business, and this
would look healthier. So I'd say, you got that and then maybe a small dynamic
in Mexico where we've seen a couple of distributors consolidate. And when
distributors consolidate, there's a little more negotiating power and so forth.
So we've seen a little bit of disruption in Mexico. But to be honest, that one
hardly makes the radar screen of impacting the overall global growth of EPD.
The biggest issue was this quarter Russia. I think we'll still see Russia
impacting the numbers next quarter. So I'd say, we're probably going to look at
the same kind of a number, particularly given the Russia impact next quarter,
and then I think we'll start to see it turn.

MICHAEL NEIL WEINSTEIN: That's good color. Miles, let me
just ask one follow-up. So you grew 6.9% organic this quarter. Your guidance
for the year is 6% to 7%. If there's probably a bigger-picture question people
will have, it's on sustainability. So would you mind just spending a minute?
It's obviously only April of 2018, but just -- could you just give us your
thoughts on your ability to sustain this type of revenue growth.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. I think, overall, I'd say this range of
revenue growth we're going to sustain. I know that I indicated on the last
call, I expect to be at the higher end of this. And each day that goes by,
whether you have a Russia or a tweet or something that affects the expectations
in the market, it adjusts. I'm less concerned about a couple of tenths of a
point of growth and I'm less concerned about the details of each quarter. I
mean, I pay attention to that because obviously it matters to investors. I'm
much more concerned about the long-term sustainability of the overall growth
trajectory of the company. And that, I'm pretty confident in. I'm not sure I
can predict every quarter to the 10th. And -- but I would tell you that the
overall sustainable growth of the company, I feel pretty confident about and
particularly in this range for now for this year and beyond because there is so
much new product launch and so much sustainable launch. I mean, just between
the series of Alinity analyzers and Libre and the new products launched by our
Medical Device groups, there's an awful lot of new product tracking here. And
so -- and that's not just a temporal thing that goes a couple of months or a
couple of quarters. Our objective was to make sure that we had really healthy,
robust R&D pipelines and a good cadence of new product launches so we could
sustain growth organically. And then, whether we ever do anything else
opportunistically in M&A and so forth becomes purely that: opportunistic
and very strategic. So I think with the underlying baseline, I'm pretty
confident of the current sales trajectory of the company. And I think we've got
some pretty solid validation points here with the performance of the new
products that have launched that are quite visible, quite trackable, quite
predictable to validate the growth prospects going forward. So whether it's 6.5%,
6.7%, 6.9% might vary quarter-to-quarter because lots of things happen
quarter-to-quarter. But overall, I think that growth range is pretty doable.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from David Lewis from
Morgan Stanley.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: (inaudible) David's having some
technical (inaudible)

(technical difficulty)

OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen
from Wells Fargo.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO
SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to start with Nutrition and then
ask a couple of follow-up questions on Libre. Obviously, the bright spot here
in the quarter was the acceleration in Nutrition. So Miles, can you talk about
the sustainability of that? The International Pediatric Nutrition improved and also
the Adult Nutrition business in the U.S. also improved. Those are areas that
saw some challenges last year. And I was just curious as to why you're guiding
to low to mid-single digits for Q2. And then I had a follow-up on Libre.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. Let me deal with Nutrition first. I
think for the long term, I'd be cautious about setting expectations much higher
than low to mid-single digits in this business because markets around the world
have slowed to a degree. They're not growing at as high a growth rate as they
have historically. There are still healthy markets and I think particularly
some international, call it, emerging markets and so forth still have some
hefty growth opportunity. The -- but I think overall, when you put it
altogether, it's probably a low to mid-single-digit business from a growth
standpoint. It is profitable. It does generate a lot of cash and it is a
fundamentally very strong and valuable business. So I'm happy about that. I
would say that we've seen some sequential improvement because we've been
attending to what I think have been adjustments to how we market, how we sell,
adjusting to digital, digital channels or online channels and so forth in some
markets where there's been a tremendous amount of distribution channel shift
and change. China sticks out. But it's been true in a lot of places. So I think
that it's a highly competitive business in a branded space. We've reacted to
that pretty well. I give our U.S. team a lot of credit for how well they've
done in the pediatric and adult space. It's extremely competitive and it's
competitive in both pediatric and adults, not just pediatric in the U.S. And we
will see from time to time a competitor try to pulse advertising or other
things to take momentary share. But I think overall, we've not only sustained
our position, but steadily grown it from a share standpoint. We certainly see
that in the U.S. So I'm feeling pretty good about how the U.S. is doing
overall. And in some markets where we've had some either competitive issues or
just disruption like the disruption in China for the last 2 years over this
change in food safety and so forth, the law, I think we've responded to that
pretty well. And I think we're seeing that stabilize. As I said, we're making
adjustments in how we market, what channels we go to, where the emphasis is. I
think we've got some stability in China. But I would tell you, we also have a
lot of ambition to do better competitively in China which we're getting our
hands around. So right now, I think if we're able to see steady, stable growth
in this business at the rate we're at or even sequential improvement going
forward, that'd be pretty good. I wouldn't want to get out over the tips of my
skis on that and predict a whole lot faster or higher. Right now, I'm happy
that it's stable and headed north.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN: That's very helpful. And then on
Libre, clearly, the launch is off to a good start in the U.S. and the
international numbers have been spectacular. But I think investors want to get
some confidence about the sustainability of that. So I guess my question is,
first, earlier in the year, you seemed comfortable with $50 million to $100
million for the U.S. in 2018. Is that still the case? And second, what can you
say on the pipeline? I know you don't want to disclose much, but investors
obviously want some visibility beyond 2018. Is there anything you can tell us
to give investors confidence that there's more to come here?

MILES D. WHITE: More to come on Libre?

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN: On the pipeline. I mean, you have
collaboration with Bigfoot, you're expected to deliver next-generation device
to them with alarm, that kind of thing. So the pipeline and the sustainability.

MILES D. WHITE: Got it. Got it. Yes. Okay. So let me go back
to your first question about the -- we previously said $50 million to $100
million of sales in year 1 seemed reasonable and so forth. Absolutely. And
we'll be at the higher end of that range and we're tracking that way now. And
it's very early in the year as you know, so yes, I have no concern about that
at all. And let's just say, we're ahead of our expectations here. And you can
see that in the growth rates and the numbers and the patient acquisition rates
and so forth. I think we'll go out at the end of this year, $1 billion or more
on run rate and 1 million patients or more. In fact, I think we're going to
have well over 1 million patients at that point because our patient acquisition
rate right now is pretty steady and rising. So yes, I think all of that is
pretty reasonable. I'd validate that for you. And then with regard to pipeline,
the product improvements and so forth, yes. I mean, as you know, we've got a
pediatric claim in Europe. We'll have that in the U.S., that'll file this year.
There's improvements, alarms and so forth that will be -- that's coming. I'm
trying to think of all the things coming. But I would just say, yes, there's
plenty coming and other dimensions of it in -- coming out of R&D that we'll
have announcements for this year and next year. So there's a steady cadence of
improvements, variations, claims, et cetera, in the product going forward that
I think keep this going for a long time.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from David Lewis from
Morgan Stanley.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Okay. Can you hear me?

MILES D. WHITE: We can now.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Perfect. Glad we got that fixed. So Miles,
wanted to start with Diagnostics. Two things to focus on there and maybe a
follow-up on the balance sheet. Two things, Alere to our model kind of
recovered faster than, I guess, we expected. So can you talk about Alere
recovery and how the integration is going? And then secondarily, Alinity and
how you see the pipeline building there, U.S., ex U.S. throughout the balance
of the year?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. I'm just the making notes so I can
remember all that okay. All right. I'll start with Alere. Yes. I'll tell you
what, I'm really pleased with our management team. We've -- I'd say the
integration, the bulk of hard work of the integration of that and St. Jude is
pretty well complete. I mean, there's a lot of things we'll keep improving in
both businesses over time, investments we want to make and so forth, but I
think the notion of making it part of the company, getting everything under
control, getting a management team established, getting strategies and
directions established and so forth, that's all gone exceptionally well. We're
on track with all our synergies. I think we've benefited. We've -- it's been a
blessing there's been a particularly strong flu season. And a big chunk of
Alere's business, probably 15% or so, Alere sales is seasonal and somewhat
dependent on things like the flu season, it's not the flu season in particular.
So we saw an obvious upshoot in our flu-related and strep-related testing and
so forth from late fall into the winter, and that's clearly reflected in the
numbers. That will vary from year-to-year depending on morbidity and the flu
season and so forth. But some years it will probably be lighter. But this year
it was particularly strong and that was a big plus. Now underlying that
interestingly enough, as we've told you, and we think they have a lot of good
product lines that were undermarketed. We've had increasing success with a
number of those product lines and strategies. One of the things that's on our
radar screen that we're working at and we want to put a lot more money into
R&D, product refreshments, product improvements, that sort of stuff. That's
a multiyear thing. That's not going to be next quarter kind of evidence. But I
think we've got our hands around the commercial opportunities, there's places
where we see room for correction, improvement, et cetera. But I think we've got
the management team stabilized. I think it's financially stabilized. I think
the uptick in sales, while largely driven in this particular period by the flu
season, there's also underlying improvements in key product lines and key sales
that I think are going really well that we're pretty, pretty happy about. Then
Alinity...

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Okay. It is...

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. Go ahead.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: No, sorry. Just Alinity, yes.

MILES D. WHITE: Alinity. We've taken some pretty deliberate
steps to dramatically tip up our launch activity. The -- with these large systems
and their multitest menus, it's really important to have full or nearly full
menus at launch because customers when they switch over a lab or switch over
given instruments and so forth, want to be able to switch all the tests on that
product and not to have to run 2 different systems and so forth. And we're sort
of hitting stride now on the completion or breadth of the menu offerings,
particularly Europe, U.S. is coming along, et cetera. Our blood screening
system, Alinity s, has a full menu, that's up. So we've got some pretty
ambitious plans about not only conversion of the existing install base, but
share capture and account capture. I would say about 15% of accounts come up
for renewal or contracting each year. So this will be a fairly steady multiyear
rollout and trend. But if I -- I track things like our prospect list or
prospect bank, how many prospects, how many actively in the sales process,
what's our win rate with existing accounts, what's our win rate with new
accounts and I'd say, the magnitude of the prospect banks and accounts that
we're in has increased about sixfold. And our win rate in our existing accounts
is extremely high, up in the -- well over 90% category, which you'd expect
because we've got happy customers and they're always easier to sell to than new
ones. But our win rate in new accounts is quite high also. And so that's been
pretty gratifying. And that's -- so far, Europe [end] is evidence. And so we're
investing in expansion of sales force and expansion of installation, service
teams, expansion of support. It's well underway and it's going well. So we're
pleased.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Okay. Miles, very clear. And then just a
quick one from me. I think a lot of commentary this morning on growth drivers,
but one of the big successes for us this year is debt pay down. It looks like
you could be at 1.5, 2 turns net debt to EBITDA by the end of the year. I just
wonder how capital priorities could change towards the end of the year. And do
you have capacity for sort of growth-oriented M&A towards the back half of
the year?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. In terms of debt, we paid down $6
billion already this year, it's April. And we -- I'd say we expect to pay down
another $2 billion before year-end. And cash flows are strong. We've paid a lot
of attention to that because it is our intent to bring our debt down. As you
know, when we completed these 2 acquisitions, we had about $28 billion in gross
debt, and we're already at $22 billion and we'll be $20 billion or a little
lower at year-end. That will put us at about 2x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, not
1.5, but 2. And I still think that's pretty healthy, and it's a pretty rapid
rate of pay down on the debt. So the -- do you start to change your capital
priorities at that point? As -- I can tell you right now, we think the dividend
is important for a category of our investors, and we like to target our
dividend in 40% of EPS to maybe a little more than 40% of EPS range, 40% to 45%
of earnings. And we like to maintain that range and we've been steadily raising
the dividend. And I think that remains a priority. Obviously, debt pay down
remains a priority. But we're in a -- we're getting rapidly to a very healthy
range and healthy balance. Would we keep paying down debt? We would. And yet I
think to answer your point, will we have capacity if we choose to? We would.
But I would tell you right now, that's not my priority. And we're not looking
at M&A. We're not looking at anything. It's not in our priority list just
now. I do want to keep paying down debt, do want to pay a healthy dividend. And
frankly, we've got some organic capital opportunities here internally both
between the launch of Alinity and the capacity expansion with Libre that are
worthwhile. And I don't see that impinging on us so much that it squeezes us.
We have the flexibility you refer to. And of course, as we get into '19, we
clearly have flexibility. But right now, I don't feel constrained, but I also
don't have anything on the radar screen that I'm particularly interested in
pursuing because we've got so much organic growth opportunity as it is. And I'm
feeling pretty good about the debt balance, feeling pretty good about the
ability to fund our internal needs, our dividend, all of those things. We're in
a good spot.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Rick Wise from
Stifel.

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE, MD & SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH
ANALYST, STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Miles, just a big question to start off with. Maybe you could talk a little bit
about your internal investing priorities. It seems SG&A stepped up a little
higher than I might have thought. You're clearly investing in R&D, and
you've highlighted some topics, Libre, Diagnostics. But maybe where are your
priorities more broadly? And do you see that extra investment or that extra
opportunity to investment as sustaining or accelerating the kind of 6% to 7%
organic growth outlook you're talking about?

MILES D. WHITE: Rick, I don't have an investment at Abbott
that doesn't think they can use more money or a business at Abbott. It's
actually a good problem to have. They all believe with more sales and marketing
expense and resources that they can expand faster, run faster, et cetera. And
of course, there's always kind of a prudent balance to that. But I'd say we're
kind of lucky. We've got a lot of things that are launching, a lot of new
product opportunities and we've got some market expansion opportunities in EPD
and so forth. So -- and the combination of it is, adding sales reps, adding
service and support and increasing our penetration in a number of places. So
we're very fortunate I think with Libre in particular that it's not as sales
and marketing intensive from an expense standpoint as you might think. We get a
lot of benefits. It's extremely, let's say, productive, what I'll call the
digital world, social media world, et cetera, the places that I think would
benefit from a lot more resource. Obviously, there's various device areas that
would, but you also got -- make sure you've got the product ready to go and so
forth. So we've got a nice steady pipeline. I'd like to put more money behind
it. And Nutrition, it depends. It's dependent on given countries and given
channels. It's more selective. Would I put more money behind it? Yes, I think
so. I think our spend rate could stand to improve in some areas of Nutrition. I
think it could stand to improve in EPD. If I put more behind Libre, I don't
know. I mean, the growth rate right now is pretty hefty. So the good news is
we're always going to be in this balance between how much we beat earnings by
and how much we feedback into the business. And what I've tried to do over the
years is find the balance there, a balance for the investor and a balance for
the business to keep sustaining it and keep up with it. We watch on a percent
of sales basis and where our opportunities are. I think right now, I'm going to
put a lot more into Alinity. And because I think that clearly gets a bit of a
boost and it's labor intensive. So I know that's a bit of a ramble, but the
good news is I don't have a problem figuring out where to put money. It's a
bigger challenge at making sure I always keep the balance between what the
investor would like to see and what we keep plowing back into the business
because I know you guys want to see sustained growth. I'm confident we have
sustained growth and then it's just a question on how hard to push on the gas
pedal.

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE: Got you. And just last from me, that,
on a more focused basis. Maybe you'd reflect a little bit about the current
dynamics in cardiac rhythm management, CRM. The business was flat this quarter.
We had assumed a low single-digit growth. Your portfolio's filled out. I assume
you were -- did well on the de novo side, maybe not so well on the replacement
side. But just -- what's the outlook from here? What are you expecting? Is this
-- can this business grow? And just how are you thinking about this longer
term?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. Thanks for the question. The business
can grow. And you're exactly right, that's a tale of 2 different situations,
the de novo and the replacement. We're doing very well in de novo, to be
honest. And that's pretty gratifying. And it's a little slower in replacement
for a reason that some of that got pulled forward when there was a battery
issue a couple of years ago. So a lot of that replacement got pulled forward.
So it's a little bit out of the sync of the normal rate of sales that come from
replacement versus sales that come from de novo. So I do think that's kind of a
temporary phenomenon while we move out of that zone. But the de novo side is
quite robust, and I'm pretty happy about that. So as we move forward, do I
think this business grows more than 1% or 2%? I think it can. So -- and I think
we see that evidence and we've given that attention. I also think we've got a
lot of opportunity in Electrophysiology. I mean, there's parts of this business
that whether it's stents or CRM, they're lower growth rates because they're
mature and established markets. And you say to yourself, can you grow these at
a little healthier growth rate than 1% or 2%? In both cases, yes. Our Vascular
business was slower this quarter. We lost a couple of share points in the
United States over the last few quarters. And yet with the approval and launch
of XIENCE SIERRA in the United States, I think that changes. So we've got
plans. You run your more legacy and mature businesses one way and your new
product launches another way, but you can't ignore the large, established
positions you've got in CRM and stents and so forth. And we're not, we're not.
It does go up and down with different competitive launches or improvements and
so forth from time to time. It pulses a little here and there. But we believe
we can drive CRM and our vascular stent business at better rates than we see
right now. The CRM numbers you see are exactly the anomaly you called out
between de novo and replacement.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Chris Pasquale
from Guggenheim.

CHRISTOPHER THOMAS PASQUALE, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR ANALYST,
GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: One question on Libre and then
one on the Neuro business. First, can you give us any color on who's using
Libre in the U.S. today? And I'm thinking in particular about how the patients
you onboarded so far break down in terms of type 1 versus type 2 and then CGM
naive versus competitive wins.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. Okay. I'm going to have Scott take that
question for you. Go ahead, Scott.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Yes. I would say in terms of the mix,
it generally as best we can tell, it's a little bit harder with data in the
U.S. than some of what we get out of Europe because we sell a lot through our
web shop in Europe. But we're getting -- we estimate around 2/3 type 1 and 1/3
type 2 in the U.S. just like we are internationally. We think that would hold.
And we're also getting -- we feel a nice balance of competitive wins versus
people that are trying CGM for the first time and expanding that overall
category. So a nice balance kind of across both dimensions.

CHRISTOPHER THOMAS PASQUALE: Okay. And then Neuro continues
to be a really strong segment for you. Last year, you actually became the
market share leader in the SCS space in the U.S. I'm curious with all the focus
on the opioid epidemic in the country right now and pain management in general,
do you see an opportunity to move spinal cord stimulation up the treatment
continuum to reduce the dependence on drug therapy for those patients?

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Yes. I would say -- look, that has
been a great space for us and we're now the #1 player in chronic pain. So
certainly, we have a great portfolio, and that's playing out with physicians
and with patients and they're seeing great results and whatnot in the real
world. So I do think that, that category continues to expand. I think it will
take some market development certainly with respect to reimbursement and
guidelines and things of that nature. So it may build itself over time. It's
not going to be a spike. But certainly, we feel that's a really nice space
longer term.

OPERATOR: And our final question comes from Glenn Novarro
from RBC Capital Markets.

GLENN JOHN NOVARRO, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Miles, I have two questions on China. The first is relating
to all this tariff noise that we're hearing. Abbott has a major presence in
China, but I don't believe you manufacture a lot in China and then send
manufactured product back to the U.S. So maybe can you discuss the impact of
any of these tariff threats between the U.S. and China on your sales and EPS?
And then the second question is on China nutritionals which did perform better
than our expectations. Is China recovering sooner than you expected and why?

MILES D. WHITE: Let me take that one first. No, it's not
recovering sooner than I expected. I expected it earlier than this. But I'm
glad that it is it stabilized now. I think we expected stability much sooner
than this. But we're there now. So I think we've got a reasonably stable
predictable market. Are we doing as well as we'd like? Well, we'll see that
over time here. We're doing better, but I'd like to do better than better. So
there's still room to go to improve performance and improve share gain, improve
channel shift and so on. But yes, I wouldn't tell you that this is ahead of my
expectations or whatever because mine may have been running a little ahead of
where we are. Then with regard to production in China, I hate to disabuse you
of this notion, but we do produce in China. And we do bring product to the U.S.
from China. And that happened because Alere produced a lot in China or at least
a reasonable amount. So what we manufacture in China that is exported from
China or imported to the U.S. is almost entirely diagnostic products in the
Alere acquisition. And so there could be some impact financially on that if
something were to happen from a tariff standpoint. We have done that analysis.
And ironically, we've got a lot of business in China. We export a lot to China.
We do manufacture infant nutrition in China as it is. So we've got a balance.
We've got a balance of things that we manufacture, import, export, et cetera.
When we net out the impact of potential tariffs, the tariffs we might
experience exporting to China or into China are minimal. The tariffs we would
experience coming back to the U.S. from products manufactured in China are
where the impact would be. And I would say that based on everything I've seen
so far, total magnitude of impact on us if it were to happen at all, about
$0.01. And so we think we've got a highly manageable circumstance if what we've
seen and estimated and the degree of tariff, tariff rates, products they apply
it to and so forth, about $0.01. And so I put that in the category of I'm
always solving for $0.01 somewhere. So that's a manageable outcome.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Very good. Well, thank you, operator.
And thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference
call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning, and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any
participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the
entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed
written permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Thank
you, and good morning. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to apologize here at
the start for the late start. We had a few difficulties with the phone
connection. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief
Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian will discuss
our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles,
Brian and I will take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2018. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological
and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A,
Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to
release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of
subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that
fourth quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for
sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations
only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.

Unless otherwise noted, our 2017 commentary on sales growth
refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjusts the 2016 basis of
comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of
exchange; the current year and historical results for Abbott's Medical Optics
and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the
first quarter of last year; as well as the current year sales for Alere, which
was acquired on October 3, 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction to
St. Jude's historic sales related to administrative fees paid to group
purchasing organization in order to conform with Abbott's presentation.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES D. WHITE, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD & CEO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, I'll discuss our
2017 results as well as our 2018 outlook. For the full year 2017, we achieved
ongoing earnings per share of $2.50, representing 13.5% growth. Strong
performance across many of our businesses enabled us to achieve adjusted
earnings per share well above the midpoint of the initial guidance range that
we set at the beginning of last year.

This past year was a very good and important one for our
company. We performed well and our new product pipeline was highly productive,
and we took some very important strategic steps forward, as you know. Also, a
key element of our long-term success has been our ability to proactively shape
our company to ensure we're in the right businesses that provide the best
opportunities for growth. This past year was important in that regard. It began
with the acquisition of St. Jude in January; followed by the sale of our
Medical Optics business; and in the fall, our acquisition of Alere. The
additions of St. Jude and Alere enhanced our leadership, scale and presence in
attractive areas of health care. We've long been a major global player in
diagnostics, and Alere adds Rapid Diagnostics to our existing leadership
position in the $50 billion global diagnostics market. St. Jude, on the other
hand, made us a leading player in Medical Devices, particularly in the very
important cardiovascular area, where we previously had leadership in only
certain focused areas. Adding St. Jude made us a major player in nearly every
area of the $30 billion cardiovascular device market. St. Jude also brought us
into a promising new era -- area, neuromodulation, to treat chronic pain and
movement disorders.

While we were adding these pieces, we sold AMO, our Medical
Optics business. Though this business was very successful for us, we didn't see
a path that would move us into a broader leadership position across the larger
Vision Care market. So we sold the business to J&J, who was already in that
position, which allowed us to focus on other priorities and growth
opportunities.

So as we enter 2018, we're more diverse and better balanced
than ever before. We've sharpened our focus and enhanced our leadership
positions and opportunities for growth. And importantly, our R&D
productivity is at a new high. Over the past several months, we've launched a
number of products that will increase our competitiveness, open new markets and
contribute to growth in 2018 and beyond. Great products are coming from our pipeline,
which I'll highlight as I review each of our businesses in just a moment. All
of this translates into our expectations for another year of strong financial
performance in 2018. As we announced this morning, we forecast adjusted
earnings per share of $2.80 to $2.90, which reflects 14% growth at the
midpoint.

I'll now provide a brief overview of our 2017 results and
2018 outlook for each business. I'll start with Nutrition, where sales grew low
single digits in the fourth quarter, reflecting a modest sequential improvement
versus the prior quarter. In the U.S., growth this quarter was balanced across
our Pediatric and Adult businesses. In Pediatric Nutrition, growth was led by
PediaSure and Pedialyte. And in Adult Nutrition, growth was driven by our market-leading
Ensure and Glucerna brands.

Internationally, while much has been discussed regarding
market dynamics in China, particularly the evolving regulatory environments and
ongoing channel dynamics, I'd note that we've continued to see improving market
conditions there. As expected, the new food safety regulations went into effect
in that country at the start of this year. We were well prepared for this
change, and the market is in the early stages of transitioning to new products.

As we look at the overall $30 billion global nutrition
market, we see a market that remains attractive. Favorable demographic and
socioeconomic trends remain intact, which provides strong foundational support
for market growth going forward. And our position within the market remains
highly competitive, with well-known and trusted brands in both pediatric and
adult nutrition and a great global footprint that spans both developed and
emerging markets. Our focus is to continue enhancing our competitiveness and to
capitalize on future growth opportunities in this market.

Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where we
achieved another quarter of double-digit sales growth, led by broad-based
performance across several countries, including India, China and Latin America.
As you know, over the past several years, we've shaped this business through a
series of strategic moves. These actions not only shaped how we participate by
adding scale and strengthening our product portfolios, but also fundamentally
enhanced where we participate. Our business is unique in that we're focused
exclusively on emerging markets. There's no other business like it in the
world. Emerging markets are growing rapidly, their populations are aging, their
middle classes are expanding and their health care systems are developing. Our
strategy to build significant presence and scale in these fast-growing markets
is unique and has been highly successful.

Moving to Diagnostics, where we consistently achieved
above-market growth with our leading platforms in core laboratory, molecular
and point-of-care testing. The fourth quarter was no exception with sales
growth of nearly 7%. This past year was important for this business on 2
fronts: First, the addition of Alere expands our presence in one of the few
areas in diagnostics where we weren't already the leader, the highly attractive
Rapid Diagnostics market. Over the past few months, the team has made good
progress integrating this business, and we continue to see several levers for
growth acceleration, including opportunities for geographic, platform and test
menu expansion.

And secondly, we initiated the launch of the Alinity
platforms of instruments, an integrated family of next-generation diagnostic
systems for every area of diagnostics in which we compete. As we previously
discussed, the global launch of Alinity will be a multiyear process. We
initiated the launch last year in Europe and will launch in additional
geographies, including the U.S., over time. This highly differentiated platform
promises to be a significant sustainable growth driver for this business over
the coming years.

And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew
nearly 10% in the fourth quarter, led by strong growth in Electrophysiology,
Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care. As I
mentioned earlier, adding St. Jude was truly a game changer for us, instantly
transforming us into a broad-based medical device leader with scale, presence
and a great pipeline of next-generation products. One area in particular that
shined this past year was our new product productivity. In Rhythm Management,
we closed the MRI-safe product gap across our portfolio in the U.S., including
FDA approvals of our pacemaker, ICD and CRT-D devices. These approvals enhance
our competitiveness tremendously in this area.

In Electrophysiology, we launched insight precision, our
best-in-class cardiac mapping system. We also launched our next-generation
Confirm insertable cardiac heart monitor in Europe and the U.S. With a slimmer
product profile, easy insertion procedure and smartphone connectivity, initial
customer feedback on Confirm has been very positive.

In Heart Failure, we launched HeartMate 3 in the U.S. This
life-saving system helps pump blood through the body for advanced heart failure
patients as they await further treatment, including heart transplant. We also
have an ongoing development program to expand our indication here to include
destination therapy for patients where transplant isn't an option.

In Vascular, we launched XIENCE SIERRA, the newest
generation of our leading XIENCE stent system in Europe. Initial market
feedback has been positive, and we anticipate bringing SIERRA to the U.S. in
the next few months.

And in Structural Heart, in addition to double-digit growth,
we continue to advance our pipeline in several areas, including minimally
invasive new approaches for mitral and aortic valve replacement as well as
tricuspid valve repair.

As you can see, the combination of Abbott and St. Jude
created a best-in-class cardiovascular device portfolio with depth, breadth and
innovation to help patients to restore their health, delivering greater value
to customers and payers. We had a long-term strategy to become a leader in
cardiovascular care. We laid the foundation over a number of years, and the
combination of Abbott and St. Jude brought it to fruition. St. Jude also
brought us into Neuromodulation, where several recently launched products led
to 30% growth in the fourth quarter through both share capture and market
expansion. This leading portfolio of products offers a proven relief for
patients living with chronic pain and helps those suffering from movement
disorders. Positive effects of these products are nothing short of amazing.

And in Diabetes Care, sales grew 28% in the fourth quarter,
led by FreeStyle Libre, our highly differentiated glucose monitoring system.
Over the course of last year, we also achieved a number of important regulatory
and reimbursement milestones for Libre. Notably, in North America, we received regulatory
approvals in the U.S. and Canada. On the reimbursement front, we obtained
national coverage in the U.K., France and Japan. And earlier this month, we
announced that FreeStyle Libre obtained Medicare coverage in the U.S.

So in summary, 2017 was a very good year for us. We
performed well. Our new product pipeline was highly productive, and we took
some very important strategic steps forward, which yielded both immediate
results and strengthened our long-term growth opportunities. We're entering 2018
with very good momentum. We're more diverse and better balanced. Our leadership
positions are stronger. And importantly, a significant number of recent and
upcoming product launches position us for strong growth in 2018 and beyond.

I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2017
results and 2018 outlook in more detail. Brian?

BRIAN B. YOOR, EXECUTIVE VP OF FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Okay. Thank you, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note
that all references to 2017 sales growth, unless otherwise noted, are on a
comparable basis and do not include results from our Alere acquisition, which
is consistent with the guidance methodology we utilized all of last year.

Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter
increased 7.7% on an operational basis. Exchange had a positive impact of 2% on
sales, resulting in reported sales growth of 9.7% in the quarter. Regarding
other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.8% of
sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.9% of sales and adjusted SG&A
expense was 28.9% of sales. Overall, as we look at 2017, we delivered strong
adjusted EPS growth of 13.5% and significantly exceeded our cash flow
objectives, with full year 2017 operating cash flow in excess of $5 billion and
free cash flow in excess of $4 billion.

Turning to our outlook for the full year 2018. Today, we
issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 to $2.90, which
reflects 14% growth at the midpoint. In terms of our 2018 sales forecast,
please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted,
are on an organic basis. On this basis, our 2017 sales baseline would be $26.7
billion, which excludes sales from Alere, or Rapid Diagnostics, as we call it,
which we acquired in the fourth quarter of last year; and also excludes sales
from our former Medical Optics and vascular closure businesses, which we sold
during the first quarter of 2017. So for the full year 2018, we forecast
organic sales growth of 6% to 7%. In addition, we expect Rapid Diagnostics to
contribute sales of a little more than $2 billion for the full year 2018. Based
on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of a
little below 2% on our full year reported sales, with more than half of this
favorable impact driven by strengthening of the euro. As we discussed
previously, when the euro moves, the fall-through impact on our results is
modest, taking into account our European cost base and our hedging programs.

Before I review our outlook for the P&L, I'd note that
we'd reclassified certain pension-related items in order to comply with recent
changes in pension accounting standards. As a result, approximately $150
million of net pension-related income has been removed from operating lines of
the P&L, primarily cost of goods sold and SG&A expense, and now will be
reported as nonoperating income. With that in mind, we forecast an adjusted
gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales for the full year, which
reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We forecast
adjusted R&D investment around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense
of somewhat above 30.5% of sales, which reflects the pension-related
reclassification I just mentioned as well as incremental investments in the businesses
to support recent product launches and to further strengthen our pipeline.

We forecast net interest expense of around $775 million.
This forecast includes the net interest impact of $4 billion of debt that was
repaid earlier this month as well as anticipated additional debt repayments
throughout 2018. We forecast a gain of approximately $5 million on the exchange
(gain) loss line of the P&L for the full year 2018 and around $110 million
of nonoperating income, which includes, as mentioned earlier, pension-related
net income in accordance with the recent changes in accounting guidelines.

Lastly, as a result of U.S. tax reform and our forecasted
mix of global income, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of 14.5% to 15% for the
full year 2018.

Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2018. We
forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.57 to $0.59. In terms of our 2018 first quarter
sales forecast, please note that the first quarter 2017 organic sales baseline
would be $6.15 billion, which, as we commented earlier, excludes sales from our
former Medical Optics and vascular closure businesses, which we sold during the
first quarter of last year.

On this basis, we forecast organic sales growth of 6% to 7%.
In addition, we expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute sales of a little more
than $500 million in the first quarter. At current rates, we would expect
exchange to have a positive impact of around 3.5% on our first quarter reported
sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of
sales, adjusted R&D investment around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A
expense of around 33% of sales.

Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $200
million in the first quarter.

Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a
quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook
by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit
sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In Nutrition, we
forecast low single-digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full
year. In Diagnostics, we forecast organic sales growth of mid-single digits in
the first quarter and mid to high single digits for the full year. And in
Medical Devices, we forecast sales to increase mid to high single digits for both
the first quarter and for the full year.

With that, we will now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes
from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.

MICHAEL NEIL WEINSTEIN, SENIOR MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ANALYST
AND HEAD OF HEALTHCARE GROUP, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: I
think probably helpful because the fourth quarter of '16 to the fourth quarter
'17 has some moving parts. What do you think the -- kind of the clean organic performance
was for 4Q '17?

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Yes, Mike, I would just chime in.
There are a couple, but they're relatively modest. As you know, St. Jude had a
battery recall in the fourth quarter of last year, which suppressed that
baseline a bit. And we had a little bit of timing in EPD. But other than that,
that's about it. Our organic growth would be around 7% this quarter, really
strong.

MICHAEL NEIL WEINSTEIN: And the confidence in the 2018
outlook, Miles, the 6% to 7%, which I think The Street -- if you would have
surveyed The Street before they would have said you guys would have said
mid-single digits. So obviously, this is at the upper end or more bullish than
that. Is it the momentum that you're seeing, particularly on the device side of
the business? And could you speak specifically to a couple of product launches,
one of them I think I'd like to hear about is Libre; and another one is
Confirm, which (inaudible) off to a very nice launch.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. I'll tell you, the -- look, the
forecast we've put out, it's a strong forecast. It just is. I mean, relative to
peer groups, competitors, segments, the whole thing -- and even relative to us.
And to be honest, even looking at that, yes, I feel pretty confident about it.
I mean, I don't know the unknown. I don't know what exchange may or may not do.
That's always unpredictable. But based on everything we know at this point, my
view is, yes, 6% to 7% and probably closer to the high end of that. And if I
look at the underlying performance of the business and in different segments,
and I'll just recap some of this, the drag on some of the growth there has been
Nutrition. Even that is sequentially improving, and the situations that we've
seen that have set that business back a little bit have all improved and are
all improving. So I think, first of all, that's a good omen. Secondly, in all
the other areas, take EPD, very sustainable growth. They had a very strong
fourth quarter. I think it was 14%. I don't expect 14% for the whole year '18.
But let's face it, they're running strong. And then I look at Diagnostics and
devices, and they both got just a tremendous bunch of new product launches, and
they're not flash in the pan product launches. These are going to sustain
growth over a number of years because these are big and broad product launches.
The Alinity product launch, I think, is going to make a big, significant
difference in Diagnostics. I think we're going to see increasingly better
performance out of Alere. But look, Alinity is across 6 segments of
Diagnostics, and so I think that's a pretty sustained momentum. And they've
been doing a terrific job, frankly, in the 6% to 8% growth range with a lot of,
I'd say, aging systems and older systems. Now they've got an entirely brand-new
product line out there in all categories. So I think that bodes well. And then
I finally look at the whole cardiovascular device area. You'll recall, Mike,
many people challenged whether St. Jude was really growth, and there was a lot
of grumbling a year ago about that acquisition. And sequentially, over the
course of this year, St. Jude's gone from first quarter 2.4% to 4% in the
second quarter, 4.2% in the third quarter and 10% in the fourth quarter. I
won't tell you that I think 10% is sustainable for the year, but they had a 10%
fourth quarter and they didn't have to stretch to do it. And the product
launches and approvals, mainly the product approvals, particularly in the U.S.
that I forecasted to you in both July and October, all happened. And there was
some skepticism about that because of the situation in Sylmar. But frankly, our
team has done a terrific job in Sylmar and a terrific job communicating with
our U.S. regulators. And we got all those product approvals, and those launches
are all out of the blocks and going well. So -- and knock on wood, I look into
2018 and it all feels remarkably strong and sustainable, and I think that's
terrific. Tax reform was a nice boost. And there's a lot of things here that
are all looking up. And then I finally come to Libre, which -- I enjoy the fact
that every time something is announced with Libre, it's a surprise to somebody
because everybody seems to have such low expectations for it. And I think we're
going to continue to surprise people in that category. We're investing several
hundred million dollars in expansion. This is a big product. I think you
estimated $1.50 million to $100 million in the U.S. this year. I think that's a
good range of estimate. But frankly, it's going strong. We're adding probably
50,000 customers a month right now, and that's increasing, and that was
primarily Europe. That doesn't even reflect much U.S. yet. So as we came out of
the fourth quarter, the growth rate of that product is just tremendous, and
we've got a series of enhancements and approvals and additions to it coming
that only make it better. And as I said, it's not a niche product. It's a
mass-market product. There are tens of millions of type 1 diabetics and
frankly, the same -- and type 2s trying not to be type 1 diabetics, and I'm one
of them. So I wear the product. I live the product. I know the product. And I
think this product has a long track road ahead of it. And so as I look at all
the growth drivers of the company and then some of the elements of St. Jude,
like Neuromodulation and Structural Heart and other things, I think there's
just an awful lot of growth here. So I go into '18, I look at the numbers that
we forecasted and yes, I feel pretty confident about it. So at this point, I'm
looking at the success we're having with cash flow and the balance sheet,
investment in expansion, investment in capacities, investments in R&D and
SG&A, which I put more money into, and everything looks pretty good. I
realize it was a long answer, but you kind of asked the big question.

MICHAEL NEIL WEINSTEIN: No, no, no. That was perfect. And
just so you guys know, the sound quality isn't great on our end. So just FYI.
The -- Miles, I did want to ask you about capital allocation and the benefit of
tax reform. Tax reform is going to lower your overall tax rate in 2018 by 150,
200 basis points. You're also getting access to your previously trapped cash
and your global cash flow just going forward. Can you just talk about what you
plan to do with the trapped cash and then how the access to global cash flows changes
at all your capital allocation plans? And then I'll drop.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. Well, it's not trapped anymore, and
it's terrific to have access to it. I have to say, I'm pleased with where tax
reform came out. As a multinational and a company that had a lot of debt in the
last 2 years because of the acquisitions, I had concerns about some of the
structures they were looking at, but it all turned out pretty good. And I think
it will stimulate a lot of growth and investment in the U.S., in particular,
and you can see that in a lot of the things that companies are communicating.
The same is going to be true for us. As far as capital allocation, Brian
mentioned in his remarks, we were up to a gross $28 billion of debt because of
our acquisitions of St. Jude and Alere and a little bit of lingering debt we
had just over time. And we just paid off $4 billion of that, so we're down to
$24 billion. And over the next 6 months, we'll pay off probably $3.5 billion to
$4 billion more, and we'll be down to $20 billion by the end of '18. The cash
flows in the company are strong. Brian's run a program with our EVPs to be very
conscious of cash generation, and that's been extremely successful. And our
cash flows and profits and so forth right now are as strong as they've ever
been. So as I've said, we want to make a priority out of getting that cash --
or getting that debt down to a more balanced level. We will -- we've already
exceeded the targets that the rating agencies had for us. And we'll be below --
on debt-to-EBITDA, we will be below 3 at year-end. And on a net basis -- net
debt basis, we'll be below 2. So we'll be in a very strong metrics position at
year-end, and that puts us in a, let's say, a position to kind of be at a more
normal capital allocation viewpoint at that point. We raised our dividend in
December by 6%. I'd anticipate we'll raise it again at the end of the year
probably more than that because we like to maintain a payout ratio of a little
better than 40% of EPS. So I think our capital allocation, our cash flow is
strong. We're pushing down the debt fast, faster than we anticipated by at
least 18 months. And so all of that right now is, frankly, looking quite good,
largely due to the tax reform and frankly, the management of cash flow here.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Matthew Taylor
from Barclays.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR, DIRECTOR, BARCLAYS PLC, RESEARCH
DIVISION: So the first question I wanted to ask was specifically on
Diagnostics. I guess I was just a little intrigued by the fact that the
guidance you gave for the year implies some improvement, and you also talked
about that in your comments. And I wanted to explore 2 things: One is, can you
talk about how the Alinity rollout could cadence through the year? And then,
secondly, now that you have had Alere or Rapid Diagnostics under your belt for
a little while, can you talk about the state of the state for that asset and
how you expect that to grow over the coming years?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Well, let me start with
Alinity. First of all, it's 6 different systems: 2, in particular, that are in
the core laboratory; 1 that will address transfusion; 1 that will address
point-of-care testing; 1 that will address hematology; then 1 that will address
Molecular Diagnostics. And so there's multiple dimensions to this. When you've
got approvals around the world, they're all approved in Europe at this point. A
couple are approved in the U.S. We expect more approvals the following year. We
tend to be pretty much on those approvals. The menu expansions in our
developments have gone extremely well in the last, say, 10 to 12 months. So
they've got very full menus. And therefore, the pace of introduction can go
much faster because accounts don't really want to address change until they've got
full menus or close to it. So that momentum picks up. And then you've got to
deal with the life cycle of contracts that are out there in the world. Now
today, we've got, I want to say, 25,000, 26,000, 27,000 instruments out there
in these main categories -- the main core lab categories. And Michael is to
replace that entire base and of course, take a fair amount of share over the
next 5 to 10 years. So there's a ramp there. There's a scale there. It's a
significant scale. And our attention now is all about scale-up and all about
pace and magnitude. This is not going to be some incremental slow-rolling
thing. It starts that way. Initially, it starts as a slow roll, and then it's
going to pick up tremendous momentum because it's our intent to replace that entire
base and frankly, take a lot of share with it. So I think we're in a really
great position with Alinity. Our challenge now is just mass scaling and -- as
we attack that market. On Alere, I'd say our team has done a terrific job. We
have an entirely new, from Abbott, management team there. I'd say their
progress in terms of integration, reorganization, et cetera, has gone extremely
well. Literally within a couple of weeks, we reorganized the entire company
into business units -- fully integrated business units with management teams
and so forth. I'd say that our assumption of the business has gone at warp
speed and gone well. We're ahead of schedule on literally everything, on target
on our synergies. We're ahead of our targets on sales and profit. Flu and strep
seasons in the U.S. have aided that, to some degree. But thus far, I'd say
everything is sort of on point, as we've projected. And beyond that, I don't
have a lot more detail to give you other than so far, so good. And I think our
transition management has been excellent. It's been that way with St. Jude,
too. What we did at St. Jude, we've done faster at Alere, and St. Jude was
pretty fast. So we went through sort of the same things with St. Jude. We
reorganized a lot of businesses there into fully integrated business units. We
did it in the first 6 months. That's usually very disruptive, but we managed to
do it without disruption. And we did it with Alere in a matter of weeks. So I'd
say we're in a strong position. I'm very pleased with the management team and
how rapidly it's up to speed. We've got a couple of new hires on some of the
business. But I'd say this team has gotten up to speed quick.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR: And one follow-up. This is probably
the most pleased I've heard you kind of sound in a while on how things are
going. And the results kind of speak for themselves, but I know you're never
satisfied. What areas would you point us to where things aren't going well that
you want to improve? And how do you think about dropping all this good growth
on the top line through to the bottom line versus investing in all the things
that you have to invest in now?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I'd say 2 things. We still got
improvement to make in Nutrition. And we know that, and our Nutrition team
knows that. And we've had a lot of discussion about that. I personally talked
to our GMs around the world and so forth. And there's no point to having your
dauber down. We simply want to do better. And I'd say even where our growth
rates are right now, sequential improvement is a plus. Now there are a number
of places we're pretty positive and pretty happy with performance. I'd say the
U.S. stands out as executing really well. There's a number of countries around
the world executing well, and the ones that had difficulty are improving. So
that remains a point of attention to us. I'd say in terms of the happy column,
a lot of our success right now and what we're focused on is organic growth.
We've never had such productivity out of R&D at Abbott. And frankly, so has
St. Jude. And I now consider them Abbott. And what St. Jude had said about
their pipeline and to The Street over a number of years is true. They had and
do have a terrific pipeline of products. We've gotten the approvals. We've
closed the gaps where they had deficiencies, and there's a lot of growth there.
And so I -- what I'm particularly happy about is that the organic growth
opportunity here across all of our businesses, Nutrition, EPD, Pharma business,
the new product launches in Diagnostics and Devices, including St. Jude and
Alere, it's just -- it's broad and it's deep and it's exciting to have that
much innovation and new products to be launching. And so our challenges aren't
so much fixing problems or deficiencies. Our challenges are how fast we can
scale and how fast we can run. I'm pretty confident that it's sustainable and
it's sustainable for a long time because it is organic growth of new products.
So I'm pretty happy about that. It's -- I'm not out looking for M&A, and I
don't have any significant M&A on the radar screen. In fact, I don't have
any M&A on the radar screen because I want to hit those debt targets by
year-end. Our targets are more aggressive than the ratings agencies. I want to
get back to where our capital allocation flexibility is as flexible as it's
ever been. And I want to get there fast, and I'm going to get there fast. So I
think our challenges are how to keep the pedal down on that growth because all
of these businesses have opportunities at the same time and some of it's -- some
fairly significant scale-up. And Libre is a tremendous opportunity. It's a
mass-market product, and it's unlike any other medical device. Medical devices,
by nature, sort of niche therapies, this one is not. And this one has a totally
different rhythm to it, and the pace of scale and the magnitude of opportunity
is more like tech than it is med tech. And that's an interesting challenge for
us. It's a positive challenge. It's a good challenge. And fortunately, we've
got such strong cash flow, we can afford the capital investment that we want to
spend while we're paying down our debt and paying our dividend and so forth. So
I mean, as challenges go, that's a pretty nice set of challenges. You don't
lose sleep on those.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from David Lewis from
Morgan Stanley.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Miles, there's a lot of conversation this morning on growth, but it was fairly
robust EPS guidance for Abbott to start the year. And I think for us, what's
interesting is unlike a lot of your peers, who are dropping through all the tax
down to the bottom line, you're reinvesting, which it makes sense given your
premium growth. But I'm wondering if you can sort of give us a sense of where
that reinvestment is going. And given your flexibility, how you're feeling
about this sort of mid-teens EPS growth over the next couple of years.

MILES D. WHITE: Well, nice try. I don't give guidance that
far ahead. But yes, it's a good question. I have seen that a number of companies
have dropped through quite a lot of tax benefits to the bottom line. And
frankly, I expect to see that. I mean, there are some industries and some --
there are some businesses that really benefited from tax reform. If you're --
if the primary source of your sales and profits is the U.S., obviously, you got
a really demonstrative benefit. If you're a multinational and -- or you had a
lot of debt or something, it's not as demonstrative. Now having said that,
we've dropped through some of that tax benefit into our EPS, and I think that's
reflected in our guidance this morning. I did direct a significant amount of
the benefit from tax into R&D and SG&A. And I think that's warranted
given not only the new product launches and how fast we want to run with some of
these. But -- so I've directed some of the benefit to increased R&D
investments. And you can imagine, I mean, I've directed some of that at
Diabetes Care and Libre. I've directed some of that at Neuromodulation and
other cardiovascular products. Directed a fair bit of it at SG&A expansion
and so forth. When you've got these kinds of opportunities, you got to invest
in them and put fuel behind them. And fortunately, tax reform has given us that
ability. We will spend some of that money investing in manufacturing in the
United States. As it's predicted that, that would happen, we will. I won't tell
you where or what products and so forth because I don't want to forecast that
to competitors and so forth. But in fact, the U.S. will benefit, and as will
some locations overseas, where we've got already existing capability,
facilities, expertise, et cetera. But we are directing a fair amount of this to
help ensure we've got not only sustainable product pipelines and rapid
innovation and enhancements to products, but that we're also doing our best in
marketing areas and so forth to maximize the opportunity that's in front of us
as rapidly as we can. We don't want to think about it so incrementally because
I think sometimes, when you've got these new products and opportunities, you
got to go hard and fast. And I think when you do that, you establish a better
share position, a better market position, a better use position with customers,
regulators, et cetera, and that's much more sustainable over time. So as you
asked me, I think if we get our job done, particularly in the areas where we
just -- that I've just highlighted, which is a lot, I think our growth rates
are pretty sustainable. We start every year with a double-digit earnings growth
target. And as we've indicated this year on an apples-to-apples comparable
growth basis, we expect 7 -- 6% to 7%. And I'm in the upper half of that range,
in my beliefs. But I'd like to see that growth rate increase even substantially
going forward. We're always trying to be double-digit earnings. I'm not
concerned about having a double-digit earnings growth rate on a sustainable
basis for the next few years. I want to drive the top line so that I can
sustain that at an even higher rate, and that's where my focus is.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Okay, it's very clear. And I think St.
Jude has gotten a lot of attention on the call, but Alere, less so. What's your
focus for 2018 for Alere? Can this asset definitively get back to sort of
underlying growth in '18? And how quickly can Alere get back to what you would
think is market growth for Point of Care?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I'd say slower than St. Jude. St.
Jude, as you all remember, it went through about a 4- or 5-year period where it
didn't have much growth, and The Street was unhappy with that. And they missed
the earnings target a couple of times. What they were right about was they had
a robust R&D pipeline and a product pipeline, and they were right about
that. And I think the people that led and managed St. Jude should feel
vindicated about that and we do because there was a fair amount of concern and
criticism when we acquired St. Jude. But frankly, as you can see in the
numbers, there's growth here, and there's going to be growth here. And it's not
just small incremental growth. It's significant. I'm really happy with the
performance of St. Jude. I think Alere is a little longer story. The company
had a lot of internal operating challenges. It hadn't been invested in. So I
think pipelines are going to take a little longer to develop. I think restoring
sort of the cohesiveness and performance of functions in the business and some
of the business. It's going to take a little longer. So I expect Alere to
emerge, I'm going to say, over 2 to 3 years because we want to put more
investment into new products, refreshing products, R&D, SG&A, et
cetera. We do have some rationalization to do. That doesn't mean restructuring.
That means the integration of those functions and businesses and figuring out
what are old products, what are new products and so forth. So I think Alere
will be a little slower emergence than St. Jude has been. St. Jude sort of
exploded on the scene here over 1 year. And I don't think Alere will explode on
the scene, but I don't think Alere is going to be flat, either. I think -- we
believe there's a lot of growth here in this entire Rapid Diagnostic and Point
of Care space. I think there's a lot of growth. And I think that growth is
sustainable over many years, but I don't think it's going to be -- I'm not
going to be telling you the same story about Alere at the end of the year. And
at the end of '18, I'm going to say we had a good year. It tracked better than
we thought. It's showing growth. I'm going to tell you all those things at
year-end, I'm pretty sure. And we love the underlying assets and products and
so forth. I think that's all going to be true. But I think operationally, it's
going to take a little longer to get this back on an investment cycle in
products and launches and so forth that we'll want to see. The good news is
we've got so many other opportunities at the same time that I think it's nicely
staged. You don't want everything to show up at the same time. So I think it's
nicely staged to help sustain the growth of Diagnostics while they're dealing
with the scale-up of Alinity.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from
BMO.

JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH, MD & RESEARCH ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL
MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Can we turn a little bit to EPD? That area of growth
tends to be a little bit of a black box for investors. How do we think of --
about the sustainability of that growth rate? This is the second quarter in a
row of mid-teens growth.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. Joanne, it's -- I think the
fundamentals underlying the markets, drive an awful lot of the growth. The
managers in that business -- and I sort of have this ongoing debate, I'm always
chronically dissatisfied and they're always telling me, "Hey, look, we're
really growing fast here." But the fact is the underlying dynamics of the
market drive a lot of the growth because we've selected markets and countries,
emerging markets in particular, that have growth characteristics, which I
characterized in my remarks. So the underlying fundamentals of those markets
are all very positive in terms of growing health care systems, growing middle
class, spending on health care, et cetera. But succeeding in those markets
requires a certain amount of presence and strength and scale. Meaning, you want
to be in the top 5 competitors in most of these markets. China is a little
different. But you want to be in sort of the top 5 competitors. You want to
have very broad product lines, and you want to have some depth in various
therapeutic categories. And you want to have a strong brand. I think our teams
around the world have done a super job at that. And I think there's countries
where we believe we can do even better, a lot better. So I'd say, first of all,
the underlying dynamics are strong. We've put a fair amount of emphasis in
renewing and broadening our products. We put a lot of attention into our own,
let's call it, development productivity, registration productivity, et cetera.
We're putting more and more investment into India and our distributor
organizations to do just that because we believe we can and should. We're putting
a lot of attention on gross margin management to improve our gross margins,
whether in procurement or things that we source from third parties that we
should do ourselves and so forth. So there's a lot of emphasis on margin
improvement. And frankly, the margin is already good -- better than good. But
we know that there's opportunity to improve it still further, and a lot of
people think of generics as commodity generics that don't make much money.
These are branded generics where the brand matters. It's sort of an OTX-type
thing in a lot of these markets, and we make pretty good profits here. So the
characteristics of these markets have been that. That said, the last couple
quarters have some anomalies that bump these numbers up and down. We went through
a couple of disruptions in India, for example, which is a big part of our
business, where we went through the demonetization issue and then the GST tax
thing. We actually managed that really well, I think. But that affected
inventory management by wholesalers and distributors, which are a big part of
our business system here. And so sometimes, I think we're going to see some of
these quarters look very up. And other times, they're going to be a little less
up, but they're always up. And I think -- I don't think the 14% we saw in the
fourth quarter is something we'd expect every quarter. Now if it starts to
happen 3 or 4 quarters in a row, I'm going to be back with my manager saying,
"I think you're a little conservative." But I think it's a double-digit
grower. I think it's easily sort of 9% to 11% on a very sustainable basis on
the sales line. So a lot of that is fundamentally in the markets. And then
we're pressing to kind of broaden our product lines and gain share because of
the way we manage the business.

JOANNE KAREN WUENSCH: As my follow-up, Neuromodulation sales
were up 30% in the quarter after being up 50% for the beginning portion of the
year. How do we think about that growth going forward? And there's a lot of
good buzz coming out of NANS. Could you please update us on that?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. I'm going to have a Scott help me with
that, but -- because I asked the same thing. I said, "Geez, why are we
down to 30%?" It's because of the comparison to this quarter -- or this
fourth quarter last year. And Scott can give you a little color on that. But
this -- the growth rate here remains strong, and the opportunity remains
strong. This is one of the bright -- well, we've got a lot of bright spots.
This is one, clearly. Scott?

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Yes. Joanne, as you recall, we
launched first -- deep brain stimulation products in the fourth quarter of last
year, to Miles' point. Obviously, the business is coming off a great year.
We're #1 now in the chronic pain segment. We do expect to capture more share
next year. The market is growing in the low teens, and we expect to grow faster
than that.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from
Cowen.

JOSHUA THOMAS JENNINGS, MD AND SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST,
COWEN AND COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to start back on St. Jude.
You guys laid out some synergy targets around the acquisition. I just wanted to
get an update on whether or not you think that there's upside to those historic
targets, particularly on the revenue synergy side. We've been assuming revenue
synergies hitting in year 2, but are you already seeing revenue synergies come?
And then also, just on the margin contribution with the rebound in top line
growth with the St. Jude franchise, is it safe to assume that the market contribution
outlook for that unit in 2018 is going to step up nicely?

BRIAN B. YOOR: Yes. I think -- this is Brian. I think those
are the right assumptions. I mean, we're right on with our synergies as we
tracked. We've always said $500 million by 2020. We had a great year. We
executed very well. We integrated and achieved our synergies and expect that to
continue, and that's incorporated into our guidance. As Miles discussed
earlier, we're very excited about the acceleration of top line growth here, and
there's a lot of opportunities. And I think the continued growth and sequential
growth momentum '18 over '17 should be accretive to the operating margins not
only for that business unit, but for Abbott as well.

JOSHUA THOMAS JENNINGS: And then just a follow-up on
Nutrition. And the food safety law took effect in China on Jan 1. I know it's
very early, but can you help us think through what you're seeing initially and
what you expect to see over the next couple of quarters in the pediatric China
market? And also, an update on nutritional pricing in the U.S.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. I'll answer part of that, and then
I'll phone a friend here at the table. I'd say, first of all, I personally was
concerned at this switchover in the food safety law, what we had to do -- all
do to comply with product labeling and number of products and so forth. I was
afraid it was going to be terribly disruptive. And it turns out, we've already
experienced the disruption in the past 2 years as the market was flooded with
many products and a lot of volume and a lot of channels and so forth. The
single biggest issue we all had to do was reregister products and comply with
the elements of the law. And my -- all of our concerns were would we get our
products through the regulatory bodies in China and be ready for that
transition, and the answer is we made it. So I think that, I'm happy with.
We've been careful to monitor our inventories of previous product versus new
product, et cetera. So to the extent that we can have visibility to that, I think
we're comfortable with how that transition has gone. I think we're not seeing
the kind of disruption that we might have or that we've seen the last couple of
years. So I'd say, look, thus far, I'm glad we don't see unpredicted
disruption. And so, hopefully, we can now stabilize back into a more normal,
call it, competition in the market. It's a very, very dynamic market anyway in
terms of channels and numbers of competitors and the intensity of competition
and so forth. We didn't need the disruption of the food safety law, but I think
that's stable and kind of behind us at this point. Brian or Scott?

BRIAN B. YOOR: Sure. On the U.S. side, you asked about the
price. And I will just say, we've never historically really relied on price.
It's about volume. And we had a great year in our pediatric business in the
U.S., and that's all about share capture in the instant milk formula market
part of the pediatric business with innovations that we introduced. And we want
to continue to sustain to be a share leader there. But also, bright spots there
in that pediatric portfolio are Pedialyte and PediaSure, which also have done
quite well in the U.S. and are great brands for us. And then I think the story
in the adult is we knew we had some adjustments to make. We're making the right
adjustments. We know we have some innovations coming, and we're seeing
sequential improvement even here in the fourth quarter '17. And we just want to
continue to sustain that momentum and compete on share and market expansion on
the adult because we just typically hadn't relied on price in the U.S. or other
areas for that matter.

MILES D. WHITE: We've gained some share back in adult.
That's nice to see. I think the team's done a terrific job in the ped market,
and we remain the clear leader in that market. And at this point, as Brian
said, we're not reliant on price. I think there's a clear value proposition to
be marketed out there, and we haven't tried to stretch that and nor will we.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen
from Wells Fargo.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO
SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I'll just ask 2 quick product-related
questions and drop. CRM, I think you grew about 2% in the fourth quarter. Is
that how we should think about 2018? Or do you think that could get better? And
then there was a question asked earlier on Confirm Rx. Maybe just setting
expectations, could you do, say, $50 million in 2018 on that product? Is that
realistic?

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Thanks, Larry. Yes, I think on CRM,
you're about right. We would expect something in the low single digits on that
front. To your point, Confirm, really great opportunity. Obviously, we're still
early in the launch of that, first quarter. The feedback that we're getting from
physicians on that one is very positive. This is the only device out there
that's smartphone-compatible, so there's a big benefit on the patient side of
it as well. Your forecast on that one, I think, seems reasonable as well.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from
RBC Capital Markets.

GLENN JOHN NOVARRO, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Two quick questions for me as well, and both are for Brian.
Brian, the U.S. dollar -- the weaker U.S. dollar has become a tailwind to the
top line. Does any of that fall to the bottom line? Or is that completely
hedged away, question one? And then number two, the lower tax rate for this
year, is this a sustainable new run rate for the next couple years?

BRIAN B. YOOR: Sure. Let me take the exchange question. As
always, it's early in the year, so we're reluctant to necessarily flow what's
through there. It's a little modest. We know we have to hedge there, so we have
a modest impact from the sales I quoted. As I think Miles said before, let's
see how things go. If rates hold and things pan out, and history is an
indicator, similar to last year, we may see some of those flow through. But I
think it's just too early. There's a lot of events that we watch, right,
throughout the year. Go ahead, Miles.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes, let me just add one comment to that. As
you plan a year, we all can calculate what we believe our tax reform impact is
going to be given our geographic mix and so forth, as you know. And then
there's exchange. And if you're multinational, you got a lot of currencies to
deal with. It's not so predictable. The exchange happens to us a lot of times,
and so we try to prepare for that with hedges. That said, going into the year,
what we chose to do was say, listen, we're going to put some of the tax benefit
from tax reform into the EPS and we're going to put some of it into investment,
as I described earlier, because that, we can forecast. We can predict. It's
knowable. Exchange isn't so knowable. So if exchange continues to benefit us,
there's really not enough time in a given quarter or year to reliably invest
back the benefit of exchange. So the likelihood is if exchange runs better than
we forecasted at this point, investors are likely to see some of that.
Obviously, we hedge some of it to protect the stability of earnings, but you
can't hedge it all. So if we are favorable, yes, you'll probably see it.

GLENN JOHN NOVARRO: And on the tax rate.

BRIAN B. YOOR: Sure. And as I mentioned earlier, the range
we got was 14.5% to 15% for '18. There's a lot of moving parts to tax reform.
I'll just note that regulations are still being formed. Interpretations are
ongoing. But from where we sit today, we believe we should generally be in the
same ballpark of this range. And we'll provide further updates as we learn
more, too, as the tax laws unfold here.

OPERATOR: Our final question comes from Bob Hopkins from
Bank of America.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFA MERRILL
LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just 2 quick questions. One is on emerging markets. I
just wanted to see what emerging market growth was in the quarter and if that
accelerated in the fourth quarter versus earlier in the year, and then what
your outlook is for kind of 2018 from an emerging market perspective because it
seems like things are really going well in emerging markets generally. That's
just the first question.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Yes, I think that's a fair
characterization. Generally, when it's quiet, things are going good in emerging
markets, and it's been fairly quiet. We did deliver double-digit growth in
emerging markets this quarter. To Miles' point, there's a lot of strong
fundamentals in those markets that would point towards growth going forward.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS: And then the other one I wanted to ask
about was just back on FreeStyle Libre, I think you mentioned earlier in the
call that you're bringing on 50,000 new customers, I believe you said, a month.
And actually, I assume...

MILES D. WHITE: A quarter. Yes, I'm sorry. Let me -- if I
misspoke, per quarter.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS: Okay, that makes more sense. But still,
a big number. And I assume right now, the majority of that, obviously, is
outside the United States. Can you give us a sense as to kind of your -- the
pace of your sign-ups in the U.S. and what you sort of think for 2018 from a
patient perspective for Libre in the U.S.?

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Yes. I would just say, look, we
launched pretty much right at the end of the year. Obviously, there's very
modest sales in the fourth quarter number there. Without getting the number, I
would say, the scripts are basically tracking right with our expectations. I
think Miles had mentioned a quarter or so back when asked what a reasonable
estimate for year 1 sales would be, and it was agreed upon it'd probably be in
the $50 million to $100 million range, and that's still where we sit today.

Well, very good. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you
for all of your questions. And that concludes Abbott's conference call. A

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning, and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any
participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the
entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed
written permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Good
morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice
President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening
remarks, and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail.
Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for the purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions
that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties
that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements.

Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other
factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk
Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to
release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of
subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that
third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for
sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations
only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.

Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth
refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjusts the 2016 basis of
comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of
exchange as well as current and historical results for Abbott's Medical Optics
and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the
first quarter of 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction in St.
Jude's historic sales related to administrative fees paid to group purchasing
organizations in order to conform with Abbott's presentations.

Earlier this month, Abbott completed its acquisition of
Alere. Given there are only 3 months remaining in the year, I'd note that
comparable sales growth guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 do
not include Alere, which is consistent with the guidance methodology we've
utilized since the beginning of the year.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES D. WHITE, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD & CEO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, we reported ongoing
earnings per share of $0.66, at the high end of our guidance range and
reflecting double-digit growth. We also raised the midpoint of our 2017
adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.48 to $2.50,
which is at the upper end of the range we set at the beginning of the year.

Sales increased more than 5% in the quarter, led by strong
performance in Established Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices. At the
beginning of the year, I commented that we were entering a period where
innovation and new product launches would enhance our competitiveness and
fortify our leading market positions. We're seeing this play out through the
first 3 quarters of the year, with significant growth contributions from
several recently launched products and important advancements across our
innovative new product pipeline. I'll highlight several examples as I summarize
our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Brian.

I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth
of more than 5% in the quarter, which was led by strong international
performance. During the quarter, we continued the initial European launch of
our new Alinity family of systems, which now includes 5 recently launched
instruments in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening,
hematology and point-of-care testing. As we've stated previously, our primary
focus during this initial launch period has been to convert a number of
long-tenured Abbott customers to Alinity, and we continue to make progress on
that front across all of the major European countries. We continue to
anticipate CE Mark for Alinity molecular diagnostic system in the coming months
and expect to begin the launch of the Alinity instruments in the U.S. in 2018.

During the quarter, we also announced our acquisition of
Alere, establishing Abbott as the global leader in point-of-care testing. This
combination creates the broadest point-of-care testing portfolio in the world
with leading positions across cardio-metabolic, infectious disease and
toxicology testing.

In Nutrition, sales grew very modestly in the quarter. In
Pediatric Nutrition, continued above-market performance in the U.S. was led by
recently launched infant formula products and strong growth of our PediaSure
toddler brand. Internationally, we've seen some market stabilization in China,
and we prepare for the pending new food safety regulations that are set to go
into effect on January 1 of next year. Outside of China, as expected, we
continue to see soft market conditions across a few international markets. And
in Adult Nutrition, international growth of 5.5% was led by our market-leading
Ensure and Glucerna brands.

In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, double-digit sales
growth was led by strong performance across our key emerging markets, including
double-digit growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China. As expected and
contemplated in our third quarter guidance, we saw a modest level of channel
restocking in India after the implementation of a new tax system in that
country on July 1, which contributed approximately 2.5 percentage points of
growth in the quarter. Excluding this impact, total EPD sales would have grown
around 12% in the quarter. With our unique geographic footprint and business
model as well as our scale and leading positions in several geographies, EPD is
well positioned for sustained above-market performance.

And in Medical Devices, sales growth was led by double-digit
growth in Heart Failure, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart, Neuromodulation
and Diabetes Care. In addition to strong growth, we achieved several important
new product approvals and clinical trial milestones across our portfolio during
the third quarter.

In Heart Failure, we received U.S. FDA approval and launched
our HeartMate 3 pump, which provides crucial support for advanced heart failure
patients as they await further treatment, including heart transplants.
HeartMate 3 offers a number of advantages compared to existing options and
further strengthens our global leadership position in this area.

During the quarter, we also received U.S. FDA approval of
our MRI-compatible ICD, or implantable defibrillator, which follows FDA
approval of our MRI-compatible pacemaker earlier this year. These approvals
significantly enhance our competitive position in the U.S. cardiac rhythm
management market.

In Structural Heart, double-digit growth was driven by
continued global uptick of MitraClip. During the quarter, we achieved several
important clinical milestones, including completion of enrollment in our U.S.
trial for Portico, our TAVR product. And we began enrolling patients in a new
tricuspid valve disease trial, which utilizes our market-leading transcatheter
valve repair system.

In Neuromodulation, we achieved growth of approximately 50%
for the third consecutive quarter, driven by recently launched products that
offer improved relief for chronic pain patients and help for those suffering
from movement disorders. With our broad portfolio of innovative solutions, we
continued to advance our leadership position in this fast-growing market.

I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where an international
sales growth of nearly 35% was driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative
glucose monitoring system, that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks.
Libre now has more than 400,000 users internationally; and during the quarter,
we obtained national reimbursement status in Japan and the United Kingdom,
which represent 2 of the largest diabetes markets in the world. In the U.S.
during the quarter, Libre received U.S. FDA approval as a replacement for blood
glucose monitoring. This revolutionary technology is the only system available
that comes factory-calibrated, thus eliminating the need for daily finger sticks
that are required to calibrate other systems currently available.

So in summary, we exceeded expectations for the quarter and
raised the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance, which is now at the upper
end of the range we set at the beginning of the year. Our sales growth
increased sequentially, and recently launched products are contributing
significant growth across our portfolio. And we're particularly pleased with
the productivity we're seeing across our new product pipeline, which is
delivering a steady cadence of approvals and launches of innovative
technologies.

I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results
and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?

BRIAN B. YOOR, EXECUTIVE VP OF FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all
references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable
basis and do not include Alere, which is consistent with the guidance
methodology we've utilized since the beginning of the year.

Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter
increased 5.6% on an operational basis. Exchange had a positive impact on sales
of 0.6%, resulting in reported sales growth of 6.2% in the quarter. The
favorable impact of exchange rates on our sales this quarter was driven
primarily by strengthening of the euro and other developed market currencies,
which, considering our European cost base and hedging program, have a
relatively modest fall-through impact on our earnings.

Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross
margin ratio was 59.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.9% of sales
and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.4% of sales.

Turning to our outlook for the full year 2017. Today, we
narrowed and raised at the midpoint our adjusted earnings per share guidance
range to $2.48 to $2.50. Before reviewing our outlook in more detail, I'd note
that Alere, which we acquired earlier this month, is expected to contribute
around $475 million to our reported sales, and we forecast a neutral impact on
adjusted earnings per share this year.

We continue to forecast full year 2017 comparable
operational sales growth in the mid-single digits, and based on current
exchange rates, would expect exchange to have a positive impact of nearly 0.5%
on our full year reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of
around 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7.5% and
SG&A expense of approximately 30% of sales.

Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017. We
forecast an adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 to $0.74. We forecast
comparable operational sales growth in the mid- to high single digits and at
current rates, we expect exchange to have a positive impact of somewhat above
2% on our fourth quarter reported sales.

Before I open the call for questions, I'll now provide a
quick overview of our fourth quarter operational sales growth outlook by
business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast double-digit sales
growth. In Nutrition, we forecast low single-digit sales growth. In
Diagnostics, we forecast sales to increase mid-single digits. And in Medical
Devices, we forecast sales to increase mid- to high single digits, which
reflects continued double-digit growth in Diabetes Care as well as several
areas in our cardiovascular and Neuromodulation business.

With that, we will now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes
from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.

MICHAEL NEIL WEINSTEIN, SENIOR MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ANALYST
AND HEAD OF HEALTHCARE GROUP, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Miles, I was hoping we could touch on 2 topics: First is Alere, now that it's
closed; and second is Libre, now that you have an FDA approval. First, Alere.
Can you talk now about how we should think about the outlook for Alere, both
top line growth and then accretion? Obviously, everybody's familiar with what
you initially were expecting from accretion, the $0.12 to $0.13, year 1; and
[more than] $0.20, year 2. But a lot happened, too, in your business over that
time. You renegotiated the terms. You divested some assets. So I think
everybody would appreciate an update on how we're viewing that business, and
then we'll circle back on Libre.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. I think it's premature, Mike, to get
real specific about Alere. We closed the deal a couple of weeks ago literally,
and our new management team is taking over the business. But obviously, very
rapidly getting up to speed, meeting all their employees, going through all the
things you do to start integration and so forth. And I'd say, first of all,
that's gone very well. The management team we've put in place has moved very
quickly and, I'd say, very deliberately to get their hands around everything.
But that takes some time. So we've -- as we've said to people, given the timing
of when we closed it, we expect no accretion this year. So I wouldn't look for
any particular impact on the bottom line in 2017. And with regard to '18, since
our initial estimates of accretion that were quite some time ago, as you know,
when we first announced this deal because it's taken a very long time to close,
there have been a number of changes, including divestitures and so forth. So I
don't want to give you a specific number. I'd say it's fair to think that the
accretion will be much more modest than what we initially indicated for the
first year. We will get a full year. We'll get a quarter's head start. And
obviously, our intent is be accretive to our company and our business. And we
believe that with the acquisition, we've positioned ourselves as the leader in
point-of-care testing worldwide. And all of that has the intent of good, solid
growth and profit growth for our investors. But I'm going to be cautious about
what I communicate for '18 at this point until we've really had a chance to
assess it more thoroughly.

MICHAEL NEIL WEINSTEIN: And do you think the business, as it
-- as you own it and you call it the pro forma Alere under Abbott, does that
business grow in 2018? And is low single digits an appropriate expectation?

MILES D. WHITE: I think it's a good target. I don't know
that we know yet. But that's certainly, I think, an expectation we, Abbott,
ought to have. And the question is how rapidly we can do that. So yes -- look,
I think it's a fair expectation. And if I was, and I am, totally honest with
you, I wouldn't have a lesser expectation.

MICHAEL NEIL WEINSTEIN: Okay. Let me switch to Libre, if I
can, and maybe try and ask -- get a couple of questions in. So one, obviously,
everybody's excited, not only based on all your success outside the U.S. with
Libre, but now that you have this opportunity in the U.S. What would you view
as a successful launch for Libre in 2018? Is there something you could
[characterize] from a revenue number? Is it $50 million? Is it $100 million, if
you want to take a stab at that? And then second, what is your expectation from
commercial payers? Can you tell us about the conversations you've had and the
willingness and the timing of, you think, commercial payers getting on board?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I'd say a couple things. Your estimate
is -- let's just say your estimate, I'll take. And you gave me a nice range
there, so thank you. And I think that you can assume that we'll be looking at
this from a lot of perspectives, because we've got a lot of data, having had a
run rate in Europe. We launched in Europe, and it basically went
country-by-country. We started as full patient pay, and we had really terrific
uptake and consumer interest, and that was the first introduction of Libre to
the market. The fact that there was no reimbursement early on was an unknown to
us. And it was a new concept and a new way for diabetics to test. And we
experienced tremendous demand. Our first year, we were capacity-limited, and yet
we had a fair bit of demand. And second year, obviously, has gone exceptionally
well. And so as I indicated, we've got over 400,000 customers. It was
remarkably well embraced for reimbursement by government bodies in Europe and
regions in Germany, et cetera. That's extremely gratifying, that the value
proposition that we see with Libre is strong, and it's intended to be. And
consequently, we believe that part of the appeal is not just what Libre can do
and the information that it provides to a diabetic, who's a very informed
patient and a very self-managing patient. It provides them tremendous
information, tremendous guidance in the management of diabetes. And I know that
firsthand. I wear one. And I got to tell you, it's just a phenomenal device.
It's a super product. I can see why consumers like it as much as they do, and
that's true for both type 1s and type 2s. And we're seeing that universally
across the board. They use it in different ways or, at least, the information
means something to them in different ways, whether they're managing insulin or
whether they're managing diet and exercise and other things. So I'd say, first
of all, I expect demand to be pretty strong. Secondly, the U.S. market knows
about Libre. It knows a lot about Libre because of all the experience that
we've had in the last year in Europe. So I do expect a more educated, ready,
prepared, anticipating, demanding market in the U.S. As it relates to payers,
which I would call the second dimension of this, I think our value proposition
is quite strong. The product is priced at a very economic and affordable level.
The intention there is as much and broad access as possible and as rapidly as
possible. And I think that value proposition is stunning compared to
competitive offerings, and I think that's going to make it strong. We are in
discussions with payers. And we are in discussion with payers about that value
proposition, and I believe that will all go very well. I know that's not as
much detail as you'd like to have, but it's as much as I'm willing to share at
this point. Because right now, I would tell you, we expect a good, strong, out
of the blocks performance, like you described. And beyond that -- I mean, right
now, Mike, we're adding about 50,000 patients a quarter, and that's across a
continent that we had to go at one country at a time, one reimbursement system
at a time. Of course, the U.S. is quite large, and Japan and the U.K., as
additions to this, are also quite large. So I mean, we have a fair amount of
optimism and trying not to get too far ahead of ourselves.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from
Barclays.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR, DIRECTOR, BARCLAYS PLC, RESEARCH
DIVISION: The first thing I wanted to ask about was, certainly it was
encouraging that you got MRI conditional labeling for your ICD in the quarter.
So I was hoping we could get an update on how things are going in Sylmar and
then when we might expect the approval for CRT-D and maybe the ICM as well?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. I'd say a couple of things, Matt. First
of all, let me back up and give a bigger context to this. Over the course of
the year, there was a lot of skepticism on the part of analysts and/or
investors about all the things that we had to get accomplished that were
back-end loaded, a lot of third quarter, fourth quarter things. And depending
on how you're looking at it, it looks pretty daunting. And we all know
everything doesn't go right. And the Sylmar inspection puts some of that in
doubt. Now having said that, we stuck to our guns on what our estimates were
and our projections were about when we would get product approvals and claim
approvals, licensure approvals and so forth. And the third quarter alone here
has been pretty gratifying in that we basically got every approval we forecasted
and within -- let's call it, within 30 days or so of what we forecasted. And I
think that's been pretty gratifying, that what we said is what happened. And
that includes Libre, that includes the high-voltage MRI claim, that includes
HeartMate it includes the closure of Alere, it includes Libre, it includes a
lot of things. I don't generally like being back-end loaded because it feels
like a lot of risk that everything has to go right, but everything did. And our
progress with Sylmar is no exception. As I've indicated on prior calls, our
team that has been working with the Sylmar team and so forth has done an
exceptional job. We've provided all information, taken all actions, done all
remediation, everything basically done on time, delivered to FDA, discussed
with FDA, et cetera. And at this point, we're just experiencing those new
systems, populating with new experience, new data, new decision-making, et
cetera. And all of that is going exactly as planned, exactly as forecasted,
exactly as communicated with the FDA and thus far, without a hiccup. And I
think that's recognized by the FDA. I think it's recognized. They have
discretion. They don't have to license new products out of that facility, but
they have. And I think that, that is evidence of how we're progressing with
Sylmar and the fact that the FDA is giving it all the scrutiny that they would
and should. And that what we've submitted to them for approvals has been given
fair and objective consideration and we've gotten our approvals so far. With
that said, the remaining ones, I'm not going to change my estimates on. I'm not
going to change what we forecasted. I have no reason to believe otherwise. They
clearly have the discretion not to, but that's not been our experience. And so
consequently, I remain optimistic that we're on a track that we'll deliver what
we've said.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR: And I wanted to turn to another
thing that you mentioned in the prepared remarks on China. You said you're
preparing for the regulations to change in Nutrition in the new year and did
improve a little bit sequentially. Could you talk about what kind of
opportunity you could have in China if that comes to pass on time with regards
to being able to maybe soak up some of the capacity that gets lost as local players
have to shut down or change their operations?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not sure. I
would tell you this. First of all, we have the product approvals we need. We're
ready for the transition, building inventory for such, et cetera. So as far as
responding to the new law -- and I think this is true for, at least, the large
multinational competitors. I think most of us, if not all of us, have our
product approvals. We're ready for the transition, et cetera. How we all manage
that, who knows? But I think -- at least we are and I think others are ready
with new, approved replacement products, et cetera, as we've been required to
do. So I think we're all ready for the transition on January 1. What you can't
know very well, at least about everybody else, is how much inventory everybody
has in various channels, how long that transition will take for any given
competitor and so forth. We're comfortable with our inventory levels. We're
comfortable with our inventory levels, both on current product and post-Gen 1
product. So we're comfortable with what we think we have to do with our own
transition. What's hard to project is not just the multinationals, but all the
hundreds of other Chinese competitors that are faced with the same regulation. So
I'd say we've seen a stabilizing of China. It hasn't been as choppy as it was
in the last 2 years. I'd say our estimates around market growth are hard to pin
down. We were more conservative on market growth than recent data we've seen.
The market growth is better than we indicated or better than we believe or
better than we thought. And we're looking pretty closely at all the sources of
our market data because there are many, and they're not all perfectly
comprehensive across all channels and all sources of products or even all
geographies. So it's a hard one. China is a particularly difficult one to pin
down because there are a number of channels, there are a lot of competitors,
there a lot of data sources. It's not like going to ACNielsen in the U.S. or something.
So I'm cautious about it. I think we've seen the tough part, and I think we're
going back into a phase where it's the same kind of hand-to-hand competition
we've always had across multiple channels. I like that. I think that's better
because at least then, whether we do well or don't do well is a function of our
execution. I haven't been particularly pleased with our execution. And I don't
exclude a number of other countries where we do see soft market conditions, but
I also see less-than-great execution on our part. So this business is getting a
lot of attention from us and from all of us top to bottom. And it will get some
attention. I think it's probably the one soft spot in our release. I think a
lot of things are going awfully well, as I just commented to you in the device
area. But this one is going to get a lot more attention. I feel that China is,
at least, reasonably stable or predictable. We haven't been right about the
market growth rates. Those look better than we expected, so that's a plus. And
I guess I'd just leave it there.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank
of America.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFA MERRILL
LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: So first, I just wanted to clear -- clarify
something, Miles, that you said on Alere. Obviously, I heard you that the
accretion for '18 will be lower than you originally thought. That's not
surprising. But I just want to confirm, do you still think it will be accretive
in 2018? And is it roughly half the original accretion a reasonable
placeholder?

MILES D. WHITE: Yes, I expect it to be accretive. We've got
a lot of work to do to identify our synergies and identify our growth
opportunities. We're going through a reorganization of the business right now,
and I think that's actually going to be a plus. The -- I don't want to describe
how it was organized because I think that's kind of a waste of time and will
take a long time, but we went through a restructuring of the org structure of
St. Jude, and we did it within 6 months. And as you know, organized and
integrated business units that -- I'd say, that organization is still kind of
setting. The glue is still kind of setting. But we moved to it within 6 months.
That might have been aggressive, but the organization is very stable. The
restructuring activities that we had to go through and a lot of synergizing as
far as people go, we've gone through; changes in management, we've gone
through, et cetera. That all got done at about the 6-month level at St. Jude.
It all got done at Alere in 6 days. So that's a running start. And we've
announced what we're moving to. I think it's an organization like -- look, all
organizations, all people want to do well. They want to achieve. They want to
grow. They want to be proud of the businesses they're running. They do want to
do well. And I'd say our early days with the employees of Alere have been
positive. And we announced that we're going to go to that kind of a structure.
We've announced how we're going to do it, why we're going to do it, et cetera.
And I think that's well received at this point. So as far as we look into 2018,
I think your question about -- is half of that a good placeholder? I'd say
that's a good placeholder. I can't tell you with any precision that that's what
it'll be, but I think it's a good placeholder.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS: Okay. That's very helpful. And then,
I'm sure there'll be a lot of other questions on Libre, but I want to focus on
the rest of the pipeline for a second because there are a number of other things
in addition to Libre that could help in 2018. And you touched on the MRI-safe
approvals. But I just want to kind of ask specifically on some of the other
things that you've got in the pipeline and just to make sure that the time
lines and your thoughts on those haven't changed at all relative to what you've
been saying previously. And so that would include things like the new stents
that you've talked about, SIERRA; the Confirm implantable cardiac monitor
that's entering what is a very attractive market. And so just curious on those
couple of things. Is the time line still the same as what you've been saying
previously?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, a couple things. First of all, with
regard to SIERRA, the stent, yes, same schedule, no change. That'll be first
quarter of the year, we think. And with regard to Confirm, it's partly approved
already. As you may understand, it gets approved in pieces, and so far so good.
There are some peripheral pieces we are waiting for approval on, but the first
and very critical portion of that is approved. So yes, I think that's -- so
far, everything we've seen is very encouraging, and no change.

ROBERT ADAM HOPKINS: Okay. So Confirm can be at full launch
in 2018?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, right now, that's what I'd bet on.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Rick Wise from
Stifel.

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE, MD & SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH
ANALYST, STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY, INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Miles, just after a solid quarter, again, coming out in '17 to the upper end of
the range, I know it's early on to put all these pieces together in '18, but as
I reflect on it, in '18, with multiple large, new product opportunities
launching, St. Jude, Alere working, shouldn't we expect at least similar top
line growth and potentially better, if not accelerating, top line growth
against -- especially when you think about some of the headwinds you've faced
and worked through in '17? Is that the right way to think about it?

MILES D. WHITE: I'm trying to think about how to sound conservative
to you. Look, we got our acquisitions closed. We're going to have a number of
product approvals that happened in the third quarter and fourth quarter that,
obviously, should hit their stride. I mean, ideally, you look at '18 and you'd
like to have your product approvals exactly where we got them going into the
next year. We've had a really good 2017. We beat all expectations not just in
the numbers, but in the approvals. And you all have to admit, you had a lot of
skepticism about some of this, and maybe rightly so after 2016. But look, we
hit every target we had for this year. And with all those approvals, one ought
to think that should bode positively for 2018. That said, when we go through
our budgeting every year, it's kind of a negotiating tussle with our managers
around the world about what's possible in their given markets and so forth. But
I think yes, we ought to have pretty good momentum going into '18. What can I
say? All the organic R&D projects and system projects and launches and approvals
and so forth, they're all happening. And the Alinity products, probably most
miraculously, 5 of those have begun their launch process in Europe, and they'll
start in the U.S. next year. That's been a huge, huge undertaking. We're
extremely excited about Libre. We're excited about all the Medical Device
products. Everything that St. Jude represented to Abbott about its pipeline has
come to fruition and is coming to fruition. And so we're very, very bullish
about all that. And I think we're -- I think there's an awful lot of validation
in this about that acquisition. We don't know as much about Alere yet, but we
will. And whether it's a big impact for an '18 or if it's beyond '18, either
way, I think we're pretty happy to have that business. So Rick, I -- yes, I
think your assessment is right. I mean, it'd be kind of hard for me to say no,
it's going to be a tough year.

FREDERICK ALLEN WISE: Well, that's a great answer, and I'll
take it. Another big picture reflection. One of the concerns, obviously, with 2
major acquisitions was balance sheet, cash flow. But my sense is, in the first
half at least, you ran ahead of your cash flow generation commitments and
goals. Maybe, if anything, can you give us any feeling about how the third
quarter went? Remind us where your targets are in terms of leverage and just,
again, as we think about the next 6, 12 months -- or where do you think you can
-- where do you think you'll be from a leverage and cash position? Any color
would be welcome.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. Well, first, I'd tell you that this
got great leadership and attention from our CFO and our EVPs and SVPs from Day
1. And I'm going to let him answer that question because they've exceeded all
of our targets, not just by a little, but a lot. The cash flow is strong, and
I'll let him tell you about it.

BRIAN B. YOOR: All right. Thanks, Miles. Yes, Rick, we
continue to make great progress in our programs. If you recall, I talked about
operating cash flow being around $4.5 billion for the full year. I won't quote you
an exact number for Q3. But I think you'll safely assume that when you see the
quarter filed, that we are well on track to that and I would say, ahead of it.
And so we're going to continue to make that progress. As you talk about some of
the ratios, I think it's important to keep in mind both debt and net debt. So
at the end of the year, we projected a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 4.
However, when you look at the cash flow programs and look at our net debt
position, we'll be closer to 3 when you look at the net debt as a percent -- as
a ratio to EBITDA. So we're in great shape, and we want to keep the momentum
going because this is the #1 priority, to build back strategic flexibility
here.

MILES D. WHITE: I think, too, Rick, I would comment, because
I just want to get a commercial out there. This all gets even better if there's
tax reforms. So I'm hopeful. I probably -- I wouldn't put odds on it any more
than anybody else watching our government, but we are extremely hopeful of a
territorial system that gives us access to our cash flows and earnings around
the world at a reasonable rate and at a competitive rate. And that does make a
difference to us in addressing current debt and cash flows. But cash flow
itself, super good.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from
Wells Fargo.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO
SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just had 2. One, it was noteworthy that
you didn't mention the impact from the weather. You still had a strong quarter
despite the weather. I imagine it had to have some impact. So is there any
color you can provide? And I had one follow-up.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes, it did. I would comment a couple of
things. First of all, it was a strange quarter for us in that multiple hurricanes,
whether in the Texas Gulf Coast or across Puerto Rico, impacted anybody who had
operations there. The earthquake in Mexico impacted us. The brush fires and
forest fires in California actually impacted us the day after we closed Alere
at a key Alere facility there. And to be honest, it was more impact on our
employees than on our plant operations. We had a little bit of roof damage and
a little water leakage here and there. But it would appear the hurricane
affected different companies different ways, going across Puerto Rico, because
I've noted that some competitors have indicated more damage or more impact than
we've experienced. It took a superhuman effort by a lot of our people to try to
address some of that, which we did. The biggest issue was access to power
generation in Puerto Rico. And our folks addressed that really rapidly, and
we're very happy about that. Our plants are, I guess, back up and running is
the right way to say it. There's one that we're starting this week. And we're
back up is what it amounts to. And so there's, I would call it, some modest
impact. It's affected us, I'd say, at a modest level, not a material level.
It's -- our first priority was to find all of our people and aid them, which
we've done. And so in Puerto Rico, we have not experienced the kind of
disruption that some others have. I noted that another large health care
company yesterday I think had similar comments, that they've been able to
address it. We're kind of large in Puerto Rico. So it could have been worse, but
it wasn't. And the St. Jude facilities that we inherited there with the
acquisition of St. Jude were not particularly impacted. I mean, they were, but
not to the degree we might have expected. I mean, everything has been more
about power generation than damage. And unfortunately, that's not true for our
employees, and it's not true for some other competitors, and I wouldn't wish
that on anybody. But we've been pretty fortunate to get everything back up and
running. So we don't have an impact to report for the fourth quarter that we
haven't somehow managed or absorbed already in our estimates. The facility that
was threatened in California was not damaged. We were able to move things out
of that facility and prepare for damage, but there wasn't damage. And so we'll
be back up and running soon. We did have employees who unfortunately lost homes
and so forth, and we're dealing with that as a company. But from the standpoint
of the operation of the business, we are in good shape, relatively speaking.
And to the extent that there's any impact, we've already included it in our
estimates for this quarter and absorbed it.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN: That's good to hear. For my
follow-up, I want to asked about [rhythm] management. That's the one business
where, if you improve that dramatically, it could really impact positively your
growth. So I'm just curious what your expectations are for that business going
forward. Could it be potentially flat in 2018? And just if you could clarify if
Confirm Rx is going to be booked in that line or not.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. I'm going to ask Scott to answer that
one for you.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Yes. As you know, on the MRI-safe
side, we continue to see good progress on the pacemaker. We received approval
for the ICD very late in the quarter, so that certainly didn't have an impact
this quarter here in the third quarter. But we do expect it to have an impact
-- a positive impact in the fourth quarter. So yes, I do think you will see a
nice step-up in growth starting, quite frankly, next quarter, and then as we
move into 2018.

MILES D. WHITE: I mean, it's gratifying that our experience
with the pacemaker has matched our experience in Japan and Europe with the MRI
approvals in terms of share recovery and so forth, so I think that bodes well
for the ICD as well.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from
RBC Capital Markets.

GLENN JOHN NOVARRO, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Miles, you guys are doing a great job in terms of cash flow
generation. You're going to get to your targets faster for 2018, but it sounds,
from Brian's commentary, that 2018 is not going to be any type of deal year.
It's going to be more about paying down debt. Is that a fair assumption? Or do
you actually have more flexibility that if something does pop up that's really
interesting that you can do it next year? I had just some housekeeping
questions after that.

MILES D. WHITE: Well, let me answer it this way. I don't
really want the organization focused on M&A right now. And I think I'd give
you that answer regardless of what Brian said about debt and cash flow and so
forth. And secondly, I wouldn't forecast it even if I had it in my gun sights.
Most of the -- my experience with you guys over the past 19 years has been, you
like to have some indication of what's coming, and usually I've surprised you
with most of the acquisitions or other things that we've done. That hasn't
always been particularly well received, but they've always turned out pretty
well. But I generally don't like to forecast where we're going or what we're
doing until we announce it, and so I probably wouldn't tell you anyway.

GLENN JOHN NOVARRO: But is there some powder for next year?
Or is next year really let's focus on St. Jude, let's focus on Alere before we
think about anything else?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, honestly, I think there is a focus on
St. Jude and Alere. And right now, that is paying off. Look, the focus on St.
Jude, it's clearly paying off. The focus on the -- Alere will pay off. The
focus on the internal product launches of Alinity and so forth, these things
will pay off. These are fundamental drivers of sustained growth. I mean, if the
hallmark of the identity of the company is sustained growth and we target
double-digit earnings growth every single year, your organic performance, both
in terms of R&D, pipeline, commercial performance, et cetera, has to be
sustainable. And that is where the focus is. And we've acquired a couple of
businesses that, initially, were criticized as not growth, and I beg to differ.
And I think that we're demonstrating so far with St. Jude that there's a
terrific pipeline and growth and share gain, et cetera, and I think you can see
that. And you can see that in the initial couple of quarters here. So yes, I
think there's going to be a lot of focus on not just St. Jude and Alere, but
the fundamental organic performance of all of our businesses. It took a while
for analysts and investors to appreciate the uniqueness of our strategy in
Established Pharma. And I think it sort of called out that there's a segment of
pharma that's not commodity-generic, that's branded generic, that's higher
margin, higher growth, et cetera, in pretty key markets around the world. And
right now, that's our fastest-growing business other than Neuromod, and
Neuromod is hard to touch. But we're growing that business at double digits.
The team is doing a terrific job. Those markets represent the kind of
opportunity we said they did. And those kinds of growths, from an operating
standpoint, growth rates out of the business, that's what you want. So at some
point, if we can add to our footprints and add to our strategies, we want to be
in a flexible position to do that. We obviously want to get to a position where
we have the strategic flexibility that we've always felt we had. So I don't
think it's a bad idea for us to focus on the operations, keep pushing our cash
flow, keep pushing that debt down. So that's where the focus will be next year.
And I think we get ourselves back to a strategic flexibility quicker that way,
which is a good thing.

GLENN JOHN NOVARRO: Yes, okay. And then, just -- I agree
with all -- with everything you said. Just some housekeeping, just maybe for
Scott. You said Portico, you finished enrolling, that's the U.S. trial. Would
that put you on pace for a 2019 U.S. launch? And then, I think you talked about
mitral, which is the Tendyne program. And I think you said you started
enrolling. Is that enrolling in the European trial? And then is there an update
on the start of a U.S. trial?

MILES D. WHITE: I'm going to let Scott answer that.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Sure, Glenn. On Portico, we would
expect to file in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2019, to your question, so
then you have the regulatory process after that. With respect to the Tendyne in
Europe, we expect to complete enrollment here in the first quarter. It's a
1-year endpoint, so you can kind of do the math after that. We're on the 2020
range or so on approval on the Tendyne product. Really great opportunity,
though. Really -- the Structural Heart portfolio here in totality has really
come together with what Abbott brought to bear and what St. Jude brought to
bear here. So we're excited about it longer term.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes, it's a really good one to note. I mean,
that's one that came out of our own venture group from our own investments and
so forth. And we've been able to combine these things with St. Jude in a way
that I think is pretty synergistic, pretty favorable. So we're pretty excited
about that one.

GLENN JOHN NOVARRO: Any update on when you start a U.S.
trial for Tendyne?

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Yes. We could initiate a U.S. trial
here in 2018.

OPERATOR: And our final question comes from David Lewis from
Morgan Stanley.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Miles, I thought I'd end on a couple questions on growth. And I guess I'm a
little surprised that Neuromodulation has not come up in this call, given it's
been the biggest growth driver for St. Jude this year, 50% growth through the
first 3 quarters. I think every single quarter, we expect that growth rate to
come in a little bit. It's been extremely durable across the 3 quarters. Can
you just give us a sense of factors that are driving that growth and sort of
how you think about the sustainability of that growth into 2018? And then, I
had a follow-up for Scott.

MILES D. WHITE: Man, I think anybody that claimed a 50%
growth rate was sustainable will be an idiot, but -- so I'm not going to be
one. Look, we're very pleased with the performance in Neuromod. I think it's
obviously driven by the fact we've got 3 great products there. They're being
exceptionally well received by the market. They have an impact in real life on
patients and their pain levels. We're seeing great real-world results from Burst
and DRG. I think it's a really great group of products and a strong
organization. I think that the products hit a segment that's in crying need of
improvements for patients and particularly at a time when pain drugs are and so
forth are a national issue. So I don't know. I think the new products are
driving the growth, and the execution has been strong. The uptake has been
strong. We've had 3 quarters in a row of 50% or better growth. How long will it
be like that? Look, we'll start to lap it, and the law of big numbers will
start to diminish the growth rate, but the actual raw growth will still be
pretty strong. So I don't know. I like what we see, but it's hard for me to
hold it up as an example to all the other businesses and say, "You should
do this."

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Sure, very clear. And then, maybe Brian or
Scott, just to wrap up here. Into the fourth quarter, because I think you could
set the tone for investors as they think about next year's growth rate. You're
certainly guiding to sequential acceleration, sort of mid- to high. Can you
just kind of run through kind of sequentially what are those key components
that get that acceleration because, as I said, I think it sets the tone for
'18?

BRIAN B. YOOR: Yes, I'll take this. I think it's just what Miles
had talked about, the continued growth of our branded generics business. It's
been performing at the double-digit range. I think you should expect more of
the same there. If we look at Diagnostics, just sustain what you're doing. We
do expect improvement at that business over time as we continue to roll out our
Alinity platforms across the globe. Diabetes Care, you know that story. It's
growing very strong, and we're excited to bring that here to the U.S. And most
notably, and I mentioned this in my guidance on the Medical Device side, that's
where the step-up is, where I talked about a mid- to high single digit. And
Scott kind of brought color to that by saying you should expect further
sequential improvement on the CRM side of the business, because we've always
said the magic formula is just bring that back to flat and the double-digit
growth of all these high-growth areas will shine through and deliver 5% or 6%
on our Medical Device business. Those are really the key catalysts here. So
we're looking forward to a good fourth quarter here.

SCOTT M. LEINENWEBER: Very good. Well, thank you, operator,
and thank you for all of your questions. And that concludes Abbott's conference
call. A replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central Time today

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's second-quarter 2017 earnings conference call. (Operator
Instructions). This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any
participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire
call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by
Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written
permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President
Investor Relations.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Good
morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice
President Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening
remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail.
Following their comments Miles, Brian and I will take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements.

Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other
factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in item 1A, risk
factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to
release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of
subsequent events or developments except as required by law.

Please note that second-quarter financial results and
guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the
P&L will be for continuing operations only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at Abbott.com.

Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth
refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjusts the 2016 basis of
comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of
exchange, as well as current year and historical results for Abbott's medical
optics and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses which were divested during
the first quarter of 2017.

Comparable growth also reflects a reduction to St. Jude's
historical sales related to administrative fees paid to group purchasing
organizations in order to confirm with Abbott's presentation. With that, I will
now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES WHITE, CHAIRMAN & CEO, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Okay,
thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today we reported ongoing earnings per share of
$0.62, which exceeds our previous guidance range and reflects double-digit
growth. Sales increased 3% on a comparable basis in the quarter and we continue
to expect accelerated sales growth in the second half of the year.

We started the year targeting double-digit EPS growth and we
are adding to it today by raising the midpoint of our full-year adjusted EPS
guidance from $2.45 to $2.48, which represents 13% growth over last year.

Halfway through the year we are on track with all of our key
priorities. The integration of St. Jude's continues to go well and we are right
on track with our deal model and projected synergy targets. We are also right
on track in terms of our new product launch expectations, which includes
bringing our MRI compatible rhythm management devices to the US.

During the first half of the year we received FDA approval
for our MRI compatible pacemaker and we've completed regulatory submissions for
our MRI compatible defibrillator devices, including submission of our CRT-D
device in June.

We've also seen significant growth contributions from
several recently launched products across our portfolio which I will highlight
as I summarize our second-quarter results in more detail before turning the
call over to Brian. I will start with diagnostics where we achieved sales
growth of 5.5% in the quarter.

Growth was led by strong performance in Core Laboratory and
Point of Care Diagnostics. This business, which is already a global leader and
growing faster than its market, is in the early innings of significantly
enhancing its competitive position with the launch of Alinity, a highly
differentiated and innovative suite of new systems across all areas where we
compete.

During the quarter we achieved CE Mark approval for Alinity
hq, our new hematology system, which quantifies different types of blood cells
to help diagnose blood-related diseases. This represents the 5th new Alinity
system we've launched in Europe since November of last year and we will
continue this launch cadence next year by bringing these systems into the US
market.

In nutrition, sales grew modestly in the quarter.
Internationally, as you know, market conditions are expected to remain
challenging in China over the near-term in advance of pending regulatory
changes in that country. Outside of China, we have seen some softening in a few
international markets.

While volume continues to grow at levels consistent with
historical trends, pricing power, which had previously contributed to overall
market growth, has moderated. As a result we lowered our full-year nutrition
growth guidance earlier this year and we now expect the global nutrition market
to grow in the low- to mid-single-digits over the longer term, which is still a
healthy growth rate for a market this size.

We remain focused on outperforming the market with our
well-balanced portfolio of leading brands, which we are achieving in US
pediatric nutrition, where sales grew 8% in the quarter as we continue to
capture share with recently launched infant formula products as well as strong
growth of our PediaSure toddler brand.

In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, growth in the
quarter was led by double-digit growth in China, Russia and several markets in
Latin America including Brazil. During the quarter sales were impacted by
channel dynamics associated with the implementation of a new Goods and Services
Tax system in India. Excluding us impact EPD sales would have current
high-single-digits overall, in line with our previous guidance.

This business is fulfilling the vision we had when we
created it. There is no other business like it in the world. We are in the
right countries and the right therapeutic areas and our unique model is driving
consistent above market performance in the fastest growing pharmaceutical
markets in the world.

And in Medical Devices sales growth was led by continue
double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care, as
well as high-single-digit growth in Structural Heart.

In Neuromodulation, sales growth of nearly 50% further
strengthened our leadership position in the fast-growing market for treating
chronic pain through spinal stimulation. Our strong growth in this market has
been led by recently launched products that offer improved pain relief and
fewer side effects.

In Structural Heart sales were led by continued double-digit
growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive
repair of mitral regurgitation. In June we completed patient enrollment in our
trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MitraClip in patients with
functional mitral regurgitation. We expect the final results from this trial
around this time next year, which could result in a significant expansion of
the US market opportunity for MitraClip.

In Electrophysiology, which achieved another quarter of
double-digit growth, we continue to anticipate US approval of our Confirm
Insertable Cardiac Monitor during the second half of the year. And in Heart
Failure we continue to anticipate US approval of HeartMate III later this year.

I will wrap up Medical Devices with Diabetes Care where
international sales growth of 25% was driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative
glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks.
During the quarter Libre achieved regulatory approval in Canada and we've
continued to achieve national reimbursement status in a number of countries,
most recently France and Switzerland.

Today roughly half of our Libre sales come from patients
with full or partial reimbursement. And just last week we announced an
agreement with Bigfoot Biomedical to develop and commercialize diabetes
management systems. This collaboration well help bring these best-in-class
technologies to more patients with the goal of transforming the way diabetes is
managed.

So in summary, we are on track with all of our key
priorities including growth contributions from recently launched products and
achievement of important regulatory milestones across our pipeline. The
integration of St. Jude continues to go very well and we are on track to
achieve our projected synergy targets. And we are raising our full-year
adjusted EPS guidance range which continues to reflect double-digit growth.

I will now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our
results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian.

BRIAN YOOR, EVP, FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Okay, thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all
references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable
basis, which is consistent with the guidance we previously provided.

Turning to our results, sales for the second quarter
increased 2.9% on an operational basis. Excluding the transitory impact of the
new Goods and Services Tax system implementation in India, which lowered our
sales in our Established Pharmaceuticals, total operational sales would have
grown 3.7% in the quarter, which is in line with previous guidance. Exchange
had an unfavorable impact of 1% on total sales resulting in reported sales
growth of 2% in the quarter.

As you know, exchange headwinds have eased somewhat since
the beginning of the year. I note that the majority of the lower
foreign-exchange impact on our sales has been driven by strengthening of the
euro and other developed market currencies. And when these particular
currencies move the fall through impact on our results is relatively modest
taking into account our European cost base and our hedging programs.

Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross
margin ratio was 59.8% of sales, Adjusted R&D investment was 7.5% of sales,
and adjusted SGA expense was 30% of sales.

Before I review our financial outlook I'd note that our
sales and adjusted earnings per share forecast do not include any contribution
associated with the Alere acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of
the third quarter 2017 subject to certain closing conditions. As previously
communicated, we will provide an update regarding the expected financial impact
of this transaction at a later date.

So turning to our outlook for the full-year 2017, we are
raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.43 to $2.53. We
continue to forecast full-year 2017 operational sales growth in the
mid-single-digits and, based on current rates, exchange would have a negative
impact of around 0.5% on our full-year reported sales, which is modestly lower
than the negative exchange impact of around 1% back at April rates. We forecast
and adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales, adjusted
R&D investment of approximately 7.5%, and SG&A expense of approximately
30% of sales.

Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2017, we
forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.64 to $0.66. We forecast operational sales
growth in the mid-single-digits and at current rates expect exchange would have
a negative year-over-year impact of around 0.5%.

We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 59.5%
of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7.5% of sales and
adjusted SG&A expense around 29% of sales. Finally, we project specified
items of $0.35 in the quarter primarily reflecting intangible amortization and
expenses associated with the St. Jude acquisition.

Before we open the call for questions I will now provide a
quick overview of our third-quarter comparable operational sales growth outlook
by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals we forecast double-digit sales
growth. In Nutrition we forecast low-single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics
we forecast sales to increase mid- to high-single-digits.

And finally in Medical Devices, for Cardiovascular and
Neuromodulation we forecast sales to increase double-digits across our combined
high-growth areas of Electrophysiology, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and
Neuromodulation, which will be partially offset by sales in our foundational
areas of Rhythm Management and Vascular, which we forecast in combination to be
down low- to mid-single-digits in the third quarter. And in Diabetes Care we
forecast double-digit sales growth. With that we will now open the call for
questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan.

MIKE WEINSTEIN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Maybe a couple quick ones
to start with. So first, the FX delta since the start of the year, Brian, what
does that mean to EPS? I know you moved your guidance $0.03. Is that the full
impact of the EPS swing from FX or is there a greater impact? Are you giving
yourself some more cushion?

And then second, Miles, could you spend a minute on the
adult Nutritional business? We focus on much time on pediatric, but the US
adult business has been disappointing so far this year. Hoping you could spend
just a few minutes talking about why that is and what drives the turnaround.
Thanks.

MILES WHITE: Okay, Brian, you want to talk about FX first
and then --?

BRIAN YOOR: Yes, Mike, I would say that [the streak] -- and
we acknowledged in the first half maybe $0.02 to $0.03. And could there be a
little more? Yes, if the rates continue to hold (inaudible). It depends on the
mix of currencies. But right now we are not factoring that and because that's
getting down to a level of precision that for a penny or two we are just not
ready to project that yet as we don't want to necessarily forecast the mix of
currency changes the rest of the year.

MILES WHITE: Okay, then US adult Nutrition, I agree with
you, Mike, we are disappointed too. And I would say what we are seeing here --
first of all, I commented at my remarks that we are seeing softening markets
worldwide here, at least in a lot of markets. And as I've looked at a lot of
the data first, the volume rates are all still there; it's mostly loss of
pricing power in some of these markets and we see the same phenomenon in both
ped and adult Nutrition.

In the US it's a little different version than other
markets. In the US we are seeing a fair amount of intensity around
private-label competition. And every few years this will happen. We've got a
competitor in the US in Nestle that is also feeling the same pinch as we look
at our market data.

We know that the competition right now is private-label and
there's been changes in the way private-label is being marketed I guess on the
shelf and so forth in terms of its positioning, proximity to our brands and so
on. So we are seeing some of the impact to that. It's something we are
addressing.

Every few years we see private-label crank up and then it
softens or it subsides again. Right now we are having one of those years when
we see a lot of intense pressure on that particular segment and that's taken
some of the growth off that. Last year and the year before both we and Nestle
invested in the category and when any of us invest in the category all of us
benefit.

And as soon as that larger investment subsided the
private-label cranked up and went right back at it. So it's kind of an ebb and
flow thing, but it's definitely taken an edge off the growth that we've seen
historically. We are aware of it, we know it. We are taking the actions we
think we can and should to mitigate it, deal with it, try and correct it and so
forth. But that's where the intensity of that is coming from.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Okay. And then just one quick follow up on
Libre. You didn't give us much of an update on the US. I know intra-quarter,
Miles, and we had talked about this; you had started a couple of trials to
confirm the accuracy of Libre for the FDA. Does that mean that approval is
likely more like year-end or early next year? And do you have any sense of
whether the FDA has gotten comfortable with the idea of a factory calibrated
device?

MILES WHITE: Well, there's been a lot of conversation back
and forth with the FDA. We've explained to the FDA how our factory calibration
is done and I think that conversation has gone well. I never want to predict
the FDA. I think we have what we consider to be a fairly proprietary process for
this factory calibration so it's not something we are anxious to share widely
and it's unique.

So I guess I'm not surprised that it needed further
discussion, but I think that's gone well. I don't know that I can predict at
all, Mike, when the FDA will come to a conclusion of its process. It was
submitted almost a year ago, so we are coming up on a date here, an annualized
date.

But I don't have any evidence that says, gee, it's going to
be year-end or longer. So I don't know that I can -- I certainly wouldn't say
that because that may not be true. So I don't have that kind of an indication.
And I'd say, look, there's good, active, ongoing dialogue back and forth,
that's always a good sign. It's the right kind of dialogue. I just wouldn't
forecast it. I don't know.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Okay, understood. I will let some others
jump in. Thank you, Miles.

OPERATOR: Matthew Taylor, Barclays.

MATTHEW TAYLOR, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: The first thing I
wanted to explore was you mentioned in your opening remarks thinking about your
MRI safe device approvals in the US as being on track. And I was hoping you
could talk about not the submission, but what's going on with Sylmar, any
progress you have made there and confidence that you can get timely approvals
just given what we've seen with the warning letter.

MILES WHITE: Yes, no problem. Thanks for the question, Matt.
First of all with regard to Sylmar, we're making good progress, and I don't
mean that just in a generalization. We had a very detailed plan that we shared
with the FDA of course after we received the warning letter.

The good news is, as I've mentioned in a previous call,
we've been in Sylmar with the St. Jude management since August of last year.
And St. Jude was very open to us and allowed our quality operations GMP people
and so forth in to participate with them.

So we've been working with them on a lot of issues,
questions processes, and so forth in Sylmar for a year now. And that is a huge
positive because it gave us a real running head start on things the FDA
observed when it did its inspection early in the year. So that gave us a big
leap.

So we had the ability to put before the FDA a very
comprehensive plan of corrective actions, remediations, etc., at the site. And
that plan is nearly complete. So we are coming up on -- we all have put all the
things in place, changed processes and so forth that we needed to change. That
is all positive. We will be updating the FDA on the coming weeks.

I won't give you a specific date because I don't want to
create a trigger here, but I'd say, look, at this point we are absolutely on
schedule with our own pace and it will seem as if we did it rapidly. The fact
is it will be about a year in all by the time we are done here. But relative to
the timing of the warning letter itself it will seem like a rapid turnaround.
But there was quite a lot of work before that inspection that took place.

So we are getting to the completion of that comprehensive
plan we put in front of the FDA and we will have dialogue with them. I'm very
optimistic about what we are doing with Sylmar. I'm very happy with the
progress of our team there. So I feel good about that.

And as I said in the last call, I have no reason to change
in a meaningful way the expectations around a couple of key product licensures
of products that come out of that facility. And I know that there is a fair
amount of question about, well, will they be impacted or not.

I think I would have to say, look, they might be impacted by
a couple of months, but in a meaningful way I don't think so. So I'm not
willing to change those launch dates for the purposes of projecting or modeling
or anything yet because, to be honest, we don't know. We've not had a
conversation with the FDA specifically about that.

I know that the review side in Medical Devices has continued
to review all of our products that are in for licensure on the same pace
anyway. And I know what that pace is and I know where the standing of those
products is and it's all very good. So at the end of the day I think the
agency's reaction to the remediation actions and so forth will obviously
influence it. It clearly has the ability to license those products if it
chooses to and we'll wait and see.

MATTHEW TAYLOR: Great, thanks for the feedback on that. One
other area I wanted to ask you about that has been very active is in
diagnostics with the Alinity launches outside the US. I guess the core of my
question is I was wondering when do you think we might start to see a pickup in
OUS growth from those launches. I know it's kind of a slow battleship that's
turning here through your installed base. When could we actually see some
pickup and how much might that be?

MILES WHITE: Well, okay let me just correct one thing that
you might have inadvertently said. You said when we see the growth in the US.
The US won't start launching it till next year. But they've in effect been
licensed and launched in Europe. So let me respond to Europe.

And frankly the question you are asking is the same one I
keep prodding our management with, and I do that just to keep the feet to the
fire. but the launch itself is going well and customer response has been very
positive.

We are taking what I would call a fairly systematic and
careful and methodical approach because, when you launch new systems you don't
want your customer to have to debunk something in the field. You want it to go
to the field day one and the history of launches of instruments and diagnostics
in general as an industry has not been that.

As you may know, I used to run that business years ago
before I was the CEO of the Company and was responsible for R&D at one
point. When we launch systems you get so much data, so much use early on from
your (technical difficulty) and clinicals that you tend to find all the little
bugs you missed in development.

And so, when we launch products or systems in diagnostics
you've got a big installation, a big changeover from the current systems and so
forth so it does take time. And because those early installations are where you
do a little bit of your learning you want it to go well.

So I would say I give them that slack early on in the launch
in terms of early, slow, methodical, careful, whatever. And yet there's
actually been really good order activity, really good uptake. We are on track
I'd say with numbers of closed accounts, instrument placements, etc. We're
getting some pretty nice size closes. We're getting some pretty I'd say great
reference accounts in all of this.

So while it starts a little slow I think we will see that
order rate pick up. We will see it in Europe -- in 2018 we will see clearly
some impact there. A lot of our early installations will have heavy
cannibalization of existing systems and existing volume, but we are getting new
accounts as well. And I like the mix of what I'm seeing both in experienced
Abbott customers and those where it's a competitive takeaway and so on.

So I think the launch is going well. I think it is going to
be hard to see for a little bit here at least in 2017. We're trying to figure
out how we show you investors the success of that launch and how it's going
without giving away a lot of competitive information to our competitors and so
forth. That's a little bit of an issue -- or at least a challenge communication
wise.

But I'd say that launch is going really well and I'm pleased
with that. It's one of those things where it's kind of a slow-motion launch.
It's not an instantaneous kaboom, but it's a rolling launch where you're going
to see rolling impact that picks up more momentum over the next couple of years
and you will see that.

MATTHEW TAYLOR: Great thanks for the color, Miles.

OPERATOR: Rick Wise, Stifel.

RICK WISE, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS & CO.: Good morning,
Miles. Let me start with Alere, which seems to be marching toward completion
here. A couple things. We saw an asset sale announced. Is that it? Is there
more to come? And maybe -- I know it's early and I know you like to be
conservative, but can you just help frame in the most general sense, is it fair
to assume that Alere is neutral this year to EPS? How do we think about it just
directionally broadly in 2018? Is it neutral, is it accretive, is it dilutive?
Just any color would be really helpful. Thank you.

MILES WHITE: Okay, good, thanks, Rick, for the question. I
assumed somebody would ask that. Well, a couple things. First of all there is
one more asset sale that has not been made public. It was one that was required
by the regulatory bodies for antitrust purposes and so forth and we've got a
good buyer, a good price, etc. The other party just hasn't said anything
publicly, so we don't want to say it if they haven't said it.

But yes, there is one more and it's modest in size, so --
but it's on track and I don't see any hiccups with it or anything. It just
hasn't been made public and I expect that that will be soon. And that's
progressing really well. I'd say we are very happy with the status of
divestitures for antitrust purposes, where that stands. We are happy with the
buyers, we are happy with the price; we are happy with the transition plans and
so forth. That's all good.

We are in fact I'd say racing toward close. I'm anxious to
get it finished and I'm quite confident that it will. At this point I'd love to
have one of those surprises you didn't expect where all of a sudden regulatory
bodies approved it and you weren't ready, but we are ready. And we've named our
transition team internally here at Abbott and how we're going to manage it, how
we are going to integrate it and so forth. Those plans are all very well
underway and so we are prepared for that ready to go.

With regard to this year, I had indicated and I would
continue to indicate neutral. I wouldn't plan for any accretion. I think
because this particular deal has gone on so long I'm reluctant to make
projections about accretion as we are into the second half of the year. And if
the deal doesn't close till September as is currently projected, that gives us
all of about three months with the business in our hands.

And so, at that point I think, look, I don't know that I
could project any accretion. I'd like to get the business on the path to
integration as rapidly as possible in anticipation of rolling into 2018. And
so, what I am communicating and the guys are communicating here is assume it's
neutral, assume there's no accretion in 2017 and the question then rolls to
2018.

Originally I think we estimated -- this was probably well
more than a year ago now when we first announced the acquisition of Alere. We
had estimated I think it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.11 to $0.13,
something like that, of accretion for the first full year. At this point I have
no reason to change that.

However -- and no negatives that I would tell you cause me
pause. And I don't intend to be conservative for cuteness or sandbagging or
anything else. But I would say I want to get the business in our hands and
evaluate that more directly than we've been able to over the last 1.5 years.

So before I reconfirm with any precision or any estimate
accretion for 2018, I want to have a few months with the business in our hands
so we can reconfirm for ourselves while managing the business synergies, sales
rates, all that sort of stuff. Because when we gave that first estimate of
accretion we had not taken into account the divestiture of the triage business
or the pieces we had to divest for antitrust. And they had not at that point
lost the Arriva business with CMS in the US.

So I'd like to see during the first few months when we have
this business what we've really got before I give any kind of accretion
estimate for 2018. I do expect that it will be accretive. I just don't know
exactly where. I don't mean that to be an indication of, gee, it's likely to be
less or whatever. I'm not even prepared to say that.

I'd just like to be able to evaluate it with it in our hands
because we are well beyond deal model in terms of timeframe for close here. So
I think we've got to have it in our hands so we can make those estimates more
directly.

With regard to Arriva, we're looking at whether or not we
can restore that and at what level, restore that standing with CMS. That makes
a difference in our estimates. There's a number of things that would make a
difference in how we evaluate the ongoing performance of the business and the
timing of that.

So, we've got a few moving parts on Alere before I can be --
even give you a range of accretion. But I would tell you that I expect it to be
accretive and at this point I'm not prepared to change what we already put out
there as an estimate a little over a year ago.

MATTHEW TAYLOR: Yes, that's really helpful. And just On a
separate topic, one of the compelling aspects of combining St. Jude and Abbott
on the device side does seem to be, or would obviously be that compellingly
broad portfolio.

Can you talk, Miles, a little bit about the progress you've
made on the contracting side dealing with large hospitals, large integrated
delivery networks, GPOs, etc., sort of presenting the whole bundle? Just
progress you've made broadly since post merger end? Do you see that
contributing to growth in 2017 and 2018, that aspect of the story? Thank you
very much.

MILES WHITE: Well, I will tell you what, since we announced
the acquisition, gosh, a year ago, St. Jude had already started to make changes
in the way it approached large national account type organizations in the
United States and we, with them, took that further.

There were some promotions, management hires, new changes in
the way we went to market at St. Jude. We contemplated the -- call it the full
offering across our product lines. And I'd say we've made terrific progress
internally in our approach at St. Jude.

We have had some success. We got a lot of positive reaction
from customers in general -- positive reaction to Abbott, positive reaction to
the breadth of the product line, positive reaction to St. Jude's pipeline and
the products that are coming. So I would say all in all I think all that's been
really good.

I also would stress a lot of times when people refer to
bundling with large national accounts, hospital groups and so forth, there is a
presumption of one product line subsidizes another and there's leverage in
that. And while that is true and can be true, there's also a greater positive
synergy of the full offering, the full-service level and the service and
account debts across product lines.

And as you know, these large integrated health groups --
they don't want to deal necessarily with five or six suppliers in a given area.
They will generally deal with two or three. And we are finding that in the mix
and the breadth of our portfolio, one of the places it really benefits us and
St. Jude is that it's very easy for us to be one of the two.

And it's a lot easier when you've got the broad product
line, when you've got innovation with those product lines, when you've got a
good compelling medical and value proposition and it's not always about just
subsidizing. And so, I find that with the mix -- and this is one of the
strategic reasons we wanted this acquisition.

I find that the breadth of our product line, the innovation
across the product line, the depth of products, that full offering makes us
extremely competitive and I think both from a medical and a value proposition
standpoint. So we definitely see that.

I think we will see that increasingly over the course of
2017, 2018 and beyond. I think if you just look at the dynamics in the medical
device business at large, the consolidation that's taken place across a lot of
product lines has been well documented and talked about for several years. I
think this puts us in a really strong position in the field.

Now, as we look at our product line, of course we and other
competitors think there are holes. Well, we need this product or we need that
product, but (technical difficulty) I'd say small holes that all of us, one way
or another, are always looking to fill either through our own R&D or other
M&A activity. But I feel like we are very, very competitive in all regards
now and that's a good positive.

MATTHEW TAYLOR: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Glenn Navarro, RBC Capital Markets.

GLENN NOVARRO, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: My first
question is on the Cardio and Neuromodulation line. It came in better than
expected and I've got to believe that's a function of St. Jude. So Miles, can
you comment on how St. Jude performed in the quarter? What was the growth rate
that the St. Jude business in total delivered in the second quarter? Thanks.

MILES WHITE: St. Jude, if we carved them out as standalone,
was up about 4%. And if you recall, before we acquired St. Jude, it's prior --
or before we announced the deal -- its prior four years had been flat. And we
discussed how we thought over that period of time they had make great
investments in their product pipeline across their businesses, their internal
organic R&D I thought had been very productive and very successful, so had
they.

And it was a point of -- quite a bit of let's call it
negotiation during the deal process. They had rather robust forecasts for their
sales going forward and, of course, that ultimately is part of the whole
negotiation.

I would say this -- their representation about their
pipeline I thought was valid and proves to be. And as I've said before, both in
the calls we've made about the deal itself or in our quarterly earnings calls,
our forecast or our deal model was built on the expectation of sequential
improvement in their sales going forward due to, first of all, correcting the
MRI compatible issue, which is well underway. And then the launch of a lot of
new products, and we are seeing that.

And then frankly in our own deal model, we pretty much
aligned it with what analysts collectively viewed as how St. Jude would look
going forward. And so far the expansion of the growth rate and its sequential
performance quarter to quarter has been on our deal model and is steadily
growing. And we estimated in our deal model they'd get up to 4.5%, 5%,
something like that, and this quarter they were at 4% and each quarter is
successively better than the last.

We are seeing improvement in CRM and we're seeing share
recovery with the low-voltage pacemaker. As I mentioned I guess it was at the
end of the first quarter, St. Jude we estimate had lost about I think it was 7
points of share in the low-voltage pacemaker business last year between April
and December. And in the first two months or three months here of launch with
the MRI compatible claim they've regained 4 of those share points already.

So we are seeing quarter-to-quarter sequential improvement
in share in CRM. You can see it in the growth rate comps. It's getting better
and better quarter to quarter. We expect that to continue. New product launches
are occurring according to expectation. I think the whole thing is remarkably
going according to our deal model, according to our forecast, and according to
what we told analysts. And right now I think a quarter of 4% out of St. Jude is
a pretty good thing.

GLENN NOVARRO: Yes, I agree. And then just -- I don't know
if you or Brian have these numbers, but just as a follow-up, would you be able
to give us your US and worldwide pacing growth and US and worldwide ICD and CRT
growth? Thanks.

MILES WHITE: I don't think I can do that right this minute.
You know, you prepare a lot of things for these calls, but that's one I don't
have at my fingertips.

GLENN NOVARRO: Okay, I don't know if Brian --.

MILES WHITE: We can probably follow up with you, Glenn.

GLENN NOVARRO: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.

OPERATOR: Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.

LARRY BIEGELSEN, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES: I wanted
to ask one about how to think about Q3 given some of the one-time items in Q2.
And then I had one product-related question. So I think it was 2.9% growth in
Q2 on a comparable pro forma basis, but I think you had an 80 basis point hit
from -- headwind from EPD. And I think you had about a 50 basis point hit in
Vascular from the royalty.

So, is the starting point really about 4.2%, 2.9% plus 1.3%?
And do we get back the 80 bps or about the $50 million lost in EPD from the
General Services tax in Q3? And I had one follow-up?

MILES WHITE: Yes, I would say couple things. First of all what
you describe there as the ins and outs going into the third quarter, you are
right and that's a good assessment. And your assessment of -- I think it was a
little bit better than 4%; I think that's a good assessment too.

With regard to EPD, this Goods and Services Tax in India, as
I think others have already noted, clearly impacted the second quarter. I think
it's been hard for everybody to forecast how it's going to come back in the
third quarter. In the first couple of days of the quarter we saw clear response
to restocking by distributors. And then it softened for a couple of days. And
then it came back again for a couple of days.

So we are seeing it restore. Whether we will see it
completely restore in the quarter, I don't know, but so far so good. It's going
according to what we projected. So whether it will come back like full dollar
per dollar, I don't know, but so far it looks that way. And I'd say so far
projections look good that way to truly be a quarter-to-quarter shift and
that's kind of the experience we are seeing thus far.

LARRY BIEGELSEN: Very helpful. And then, Miles, XIENCE has
been an amazing product, but given the issues with Absorb, what is the
pipeline, the long-term strategy there? Do you feel you need a drug eluting
stent with a bioabsorbable polymer similar to Boston Scientific's SYNERGY which
seems to have been successful? Thanks for taking the questions.

MILES WHITE: Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, I will tell
you what, Absorb has become very much a niche product that's for sure. And I
would have wished for it to be a lot bigger than that. But XIENCE remains
best-in-class stent, that is still true. Do we need a bioabsorbable coated
stent? I'll tell you I think the bigger issue is I think we need an even more
deliverable stent.

The issue right now with physicians is deliverability and I
think that's been one of the hallmarks of Boston's SYNERGY stent is the
deliverability. So I think the issue is more the deliverability than the
coating. And we will launch early next year Sierra, our next generation of
XIENCE which will address that.

So that's what I think is our single most important focus
right now. Do I think long-term there's still improvements and performance
improvements and so forth to make in stents, whether it's coating or material
or deliverability, etc.? I do. I am not going to detail what that plan is from
our standpoint. But our next focus in stents is primarily that deliverability
with Sierra.

LARRY BIEGELSEN: Thanks for taking the questions.

OPERATOR: Robert Hopkins, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

ROBERT HOPKINS, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: I appreciate
the opportunity to ask a question. So just I will start with a product
question. I just want to be clear on MRIs, the outlook for MRIs say for ICDs.
What is the latest official guidance on when you expect that to come to market?
And do you have a sense for whether you'll need the warning letter to be lifted
to get that through?

MILES WHITE: The warning letter doesn't have to be lifted;
the FDA has the ability, if it chooses to, to license it if they are satisfied
with remediation actions and so forth. They always have that ability. So it's
not dependent on particular formal lifting of warning letter. At the same time
the FDA always has the right to decide what it wants to do.

And I'd say with regard to expectations at this point, we've
said second half or year-end and I think that's probably -- for right now, at
least as modeling and planning purposes go, probably a fine assumption. I can't
be more specific than that because I can't read their minds and don't want to
forecast them and put them in a tough spot. So I would say as far as modeling
goes, model second half somewhere and year-end, but I don't know that I can
give you anything more precise than that.

ROBERT HOPKINS: Okay, no, that's helpful. That's 2017
obviously, right?

MILES WHITE: Yes.

ROBERT HOPKINS: And then one other, Miles, bigger picture
question on the outlook for revenue growth for Abbott. Because when you look
through your results here this quarter one thing you notice is that if you look
at your different businesses there is a very wide range of growth rates with
some businesses like Neuromod just doing extremely well and others struggling a
little bit.

And if we think about 2018 there are some strong incremental
drivers of growth and there are some things like Neuromod that will probably
slow a little bit. So when we net all that out do you think as we look forward
into next year that you can again start to talk about Abbott again as something
better than a mid-single-digit revenue growth Company?

MILES WHITE: Well, I think that depends on a whole lot of
things including the businesses. I think it depends on what's happening with
global markets, etc. That's always our goal. We are always -- our goal -- we
always start every year with the notion that we are going to grow profits
double-digits. And to do that you've got to a fundamental revenue growth, as
you know.

And as we look at the mix of the business I think the
observation you make is correct. I'd love it if everything grew like Neuromod
but it doesn't. And there's some of these businesses that I'd say are much more
mature, like CRM and even the stent business, much more mature. The good news
about those businesses is they are extremely profitable and they generate high
cash flow. So, in the mix of our portfolio that's positive, that's a good
thing.

On the other hand, if you are maintaining a growth profile
you've got a have a lean toward growth in the mix. And we've got a pretty good
lean toward growth. I'd say of late the one that's got my attention from a
longer-term perspective is nutrition, particularly internationally, and what
I've seen there as a slowing.

Now I think that business longer-term or at least on a
stable basis for now looks like it's going to be a low- to mid-single-digit
business, call that 3% to 5%, something like that, 3% to 5%. But that's a mix.
There are some countries that are 1% or 2%. There are some countries in
geographies that are double-digits.

The global volume growth in that business for infant
formula, for example, tends to be 3% to 3.5%. And the biggest change in the
growth has been price. And not that the price has come down, it just isn't
going to go up much. And I think that that's perhaps indicative of some maturing
in some of those markets.

We are looking at that pretty closely right now, so as I
forecast it interestingly enough it's also very profitable and a high cash
generator. And as I've talked about Nutrition in the past, in the mix of Abbott
Laboratories, it's been one of the biggest cash generators in the Company for a
long time. I used to refer to it as the bank as it funded a lot of M&A.

So it's a very healthy business that way. I think our
questions right now are assessing the shift of market tone. China for example
is actually much more stable than the last 12 to 18 months. I like what I'm
seeing in China right now. We still have the government regulation kicking in
and it's impacted competitors. There's a lot of reaction to the shrinkage of
the number of SKUs in the market and so forth, and we have talked about that.

But as far as what we are seeing in 2017 here, we are
performing according to our expectations. I think the comps obviously get
better here in the second half. We will see. So as I look forward, yes, it is
our goal to be a healthy grower, to be able to generate that double-digit
bottom-line growth.

I think that we've got to continually look at the mix, as
you suggest, how many growers we've got. As you observe, the growth rate of
something like Neuromod will come down simply because it gets bigger in the
base. But it's actual raw dollar growth I don't see changing for quite a while.
So I think that's a plus and I think we are seeing improved growth in other
areas.

So, I know there's a lot of ins and outs there, but at the
end of the day we are always looking to build our Company, grow the Company,
expand the Company, gain market share for the Company. And the acquisitions of
St. Jude and Alere were part of building that core leadership base in the
businesses that we are in to continue to drive that growth and the goal hasn't
changed.

ROBERT HOPKINS: Thanks very much for the response.
Appreciate it.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: We'll take one more question, operator.

OPERATOR: David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.

DAVID LEWIS, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Good morning. Brian,
just a couple quick ones for you and then one strategic one for Miles. So, just
a couple incremental questions. The incremental change to the gross margin in
the guide, the 50 basis points, what was driving that?

And then as you just think about the pacing of the back half
of the year, obviously you are guiding to improvement in the third quarter. Is
the right way to think about it the back half is going to be mid-single-digits
and obviously better than the first half? Or do you think the business gets a
little (technical difficulty) fourth quarter from an organic growth perspective
than the third? And just a quick one for Miles after that.

BRIAN YOOR: I think, to your last question, you will see
sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. There are a lot of items that Miles
talked about in the acceleration including new products and just the momentum
of our businesses. So I think that's a fair assessment.

With respect to your question on gross margin. Our
operational improvements and gross margin underlying continue to be there that
we've talked about before. You do get a little noise around the mix of FX and
what that does and that's just simply math there. Nothing has changed about our
aspirations to continue to expand our gross margins on an underlying basis
probably 50 to 75 basis points on that, David.

DAVID LEWIS: Okay, thank you. Then, Miles, just thinking
about the strategic importance of the Bigfoot announcement, and I don't want to
make too much of a single announcement, but is this just a natural extension of
building the brand and the reach of Libre and CGMS? Or does it suggest an
interest in pumping? And maybe said another way, do you think to win in
diabetes going forward you need to have an integrated pump and sensor under one
roof? Thanks so much.

MILES WHITE: Okay, thanks. No, I will tell you in the grand
scheme of things with Diabetes Care, I don't think we need to have a pump. But
I think there's a strategic -- what would I call it -- change happening or that
will happen over the next couple of years in the market, particularly for type
1 diabetics and for multiple daily injectors, which could be type 2s that are
insulin-dependent.

What's interesting about Bigfoot is they are taking a
different approach to the ease and the integration of what those multiple daily
injectors have as solutions to manage their disease separate from pumping. And
it's a fairly clever service and approach that I think will create not just an
alternative that makes the management of the disease or management of someone's
insulin easier, but I think the value proposition of it is going to be pretty
compelling.

And I think that will change the competitive dynamics in
that realm that is pumping. The penetration of pumps or pumping relative to the
market size of multiple daily injectors is really quite small. You'd say, wow,
there's a lot of potential for further penetration. The question is the value
proposition.

A lot of times the reason it hasn't penetrated further is it
might be too costly or viewed that way. And I think what Bigfoot is doing, if I
could comment on it from a distance, because I've never had a conversation with
them myself, is they've come up with a pretty unique value proposition that not
only is good from the standpoint of the patient or even the payer, but also
just in general in the cost of managing the disease for a diabetic.

I think it's a pretty interesting use of technology to make
it simpler, easier and affordable. Now I probably sound like a brochure for
them. I just think their approach is interesting. And in our case the
technology that is Libre is a component of that and a fairly compelling piece
of it that expands the use of Libre beyond what Libre can even do today.

And then beyond that there's other expansion and
improvements to Libre that aren't just in that segment. But I think the sensor
technology and the nature of the way Libre works has a lot of applications
beyond how it's used today.

And the Bigfoot approach is just one of those and I think
it's a pretty unique, compelling idea that puts Libre as a part of the
competition in that pumping or multiple daily injector world -- that it's a
great opportunity for us and I think it further enhances the management of the
disease for patients.

DAVID LEWIS: Thanks, Miles.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning, and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any
participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the
entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed
written permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Good morning, and thank you for joining
us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief
Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss
our performance in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I
will take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties
that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological
and other factors that may affect Abbott's' operations are discussed in Item
1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation
to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of
subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that
first quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for
sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations
only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless
otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to comparable
operational sales growth, which adjusts the 2016 basis of comparison to include
results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of exchange as well as
current and historical results for Abbott's Medical Optics business and St.
Jude's vascular closure business, which were divested during the first quarter
of 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction to St. Jude's historic
sales related to administrative fees paid to group purchasing organizations in
order to conform with Abbott's presentation.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES D. WHITE, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND CEO, ABBOTT
LABORATORIES: Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today we reported ongoing
earnings per share of $0.48, exceeding our previous guidance range. Sales
increased 3% in the quarter, which is at the upper end of our expectations. Our
full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance, $2.40 to $2.50 remains
unchanged and reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint.

As you know, we completed several important strategic steps
during the quarter to shape our company for sustainable long-term growth,
including the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which establishes Abbott as a
leader in the medical device arena. The combination with St. Jude positions
Abbott with one of the strongest new product pipelines in the industry,
including several recently launched products that are setting new treatment
standards and contributing growth today. The combined portfolio has the depth,
breadth and innovation to help patients restore their health and deliver
greater value to customers and payers.

In terms of the integration of St. Jude into Abbott, the
team has made tremendous progress over the first few months of the year and
we're on track to meet our objectives. The newly formed leadership team
reflects a blend of Abbott and St. Jude leaders, and importantly, the team has
remained focused on achieving its new product milestones, synergy targets and
financial objectives for the year. Additionally, last week, Abbott and Alere
announced that the companies have agreed to amend the existing terms of our
agreement to acquire Alere. Point of care testing remains an attractive growth
segment within the in vitro diagnostics market, and the acquisition of Alere
will significantly expand our diagnostics presence and leadership in that
space.

I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning
the call over to Brian. And I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved
sales growth of nearly 5% in the quarter, in line with expectations. Growth in
the quarter was led by continued above-market performance in core laboratory
and Point of Care Diagnostics. During the quarter, we initiated the launch of
our new Alinity systems in Europe with the ongoing rollout of 4 new instruments
in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening and point of
care. Later this year, we plan to launch 2 additional Alinity instruments in
Europe in the areas of hematology and molecular diagnostics, which will be
followed by the initial rollout of the Alinity suite of instruments in the U.S.
during 2018.

In Nutrition, sales declined 1% in the quarter. As expected,
challenging market conditions in China impacted the results of our
international pediatric business. As we'd previously discussed, we expect these
market challenges to persist throughout the year, but continue to hold a
favorable outlook on the Chinese infant formula market on a longer-term basis.
With the pending new regulations in China, we remain confident that our supply
chain and product portfolio is well positioned to meet evolving customer
preferences and purchasing channels.

In the U.S., we continue to achieve above-market performance
in Pediatric Nutrition with the portfolio of innovative product offerings for
infants and toddlers. And in Adult Nutrition, where Abbott is the global
leader, high single-digit international growth in the quarter was led by
continued expansion of Abbott's market-leading brand, Ensure, across many
international markets.

In Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales growth of
roughly 6% was led by double-digit growth in key emerging markets, including
above-market growth in Latin America, China and several markets in Southeast
Asia. Our continued focus on enhancing local capabilities and expanding our
product portfolio within core therapeutic areas targeted specifically to
address local market needs continues to strengthen Abbott's unique position in
these markets. And in Medical Devices, which comprises our new cardiovascular
and neuromodulation business, along with our Diabetes Care business, sales grew
4.5% in the quarter. Sales growth in cardiovascular and neuromodulation was led
by double-digit growth in electrophysiology, structural heart and
neuromodulation.

In electrophysiology, we initiated the U.S. launch of our
EnSite Precision cardiac mapping system, which provides physicians with
improved automation and 3-dimensional images to better treat irregular heartbeats.
Growth in structural heart was led by continued double-digit growth of
MitraClip, our market-leading device for the repair of mitral regurgitation.
And in neuromodulation, growth was led by recently launched products, including
Burst for the treatment of chronic pain, and deep brain stimulation for the
treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease.

During the first part of the year, we also achieved several
important new product milestones across the business, including U.S. FDA
approval for our MRI-compatible pacemaker, the European launch of our confirmed
implantable cardiac monitor and submission of our MRI-compatible ICD device for
FDA review.

In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of 29% was
driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative, sensor-based glucose monitoring
system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks. Now available in
more than 30 countries outside the U.S., we continue to see strong demand as
consumers, health care professionals and payers recognize the cost, comfort and
convenience advantages that Libre offers.

So in summary, our first quarter results reflect a strong
start to the year. The integration of St. Jude is going well, and we're on
track to achieve our projected synergy targets. And as we continue to execute
on our key business priorities, we expect to deliver on our double-digit
ongoing EPS growth target for the full year.

I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results
and our outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?

BRIAN B. YOOR, CFO AND EVP OF FINANCE, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Okay. Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all
references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable
basis, which is consistent with the guidance we provided back in January.

Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter
increased 3.2% on an operational basis. Exchange had an unfavorable impact of
0.6% on sales, resulting in reported sales growth of 2.6% in the quarter.
Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was
59.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 8% of sales, and adjusted
SG&A expense was 32.5% of sales. The over delivery in the first quarter EPS
compared to our guidance was primarily due to timing of spending and certain
nonoperating items. I'd note that while exchange rates eased somewhat since our
call in January, the follow-through impact on our first quarter results was
fairly modest, taking into account our hedging program and the lag time that it
takes for rate changes to work through our product costs.

Before I review our financial outlook, I'd note that our
sales and adjusted EPS forecast do not include any contribution associated with
the Alere acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of the third quarter
2017, subject to certain closing conditions. We will provide an update
regarding the expected financial impact of this transaction at a later date.

So turning to our outlook for the full year 2017. We
continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits. And
based on current exchange rates, exchange would have a negative impact of
around 1% on our full year reported sales. We continue to forecast an adjusted
gross margin ratio of around 60% of sales for the full year, which reflects the
profitability mix of Abbott and St. Jude as well as underlying gross margin
improvement across our businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&D
investment of somewhat above 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of
approximately 30% of sales, which includes expense synergies associated with
the addition of St. Jude.

Turning to our outlook for the second quarter 2017. We
forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.59 to $0.61. We forecast operational sales
growth in the low to mid-single digits and at current rates, expect exchange
would have a negative impact of around 1.5%. We forecast an adjusted gross
margin ratio around 60% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of
sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 30.5% of sales. Finally, we
project specified items of $0.55 in the second quarter, primarily reflecting
intangible amortization and expenses associated with acquisitions.

Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a
quick overview of our second quarter comparable operational sales growth
outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high
single-digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we now forecast low single-digit sales
growth for both the second quarter and the full year. In Diagnostics, we
forecast sales to increase mid-single digits.

Turning to Medical Devices. In Diabetes Care, we forecast
double-digit sales growth. And lastly, in our cardiovascular and
neuromodulation business, we forecast relatively flat comparable sales growth
for the second quarter, which includes a difficult comparison versus last year
when sales were favorably impacted by the resolution of a third-party royalty
agreement in our vascular business. Excluding this third-party royalty
comparison, underlying sales growth in the second quarter would be low single
digits.

With that, we will now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And your first question
comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.

MICHAEL N. WEINSTEIN, SENIOR MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ANALYST AND
HEAD OF HEALTHCARE GROUP WITHIN EQUITY RESEARCH, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO,
RESEARCH DIVISION: And Miles, I was hoping I could start with Alere. You didn't
update on the potential financial impact of Alere, but I was hoping that you
could talk about your view or the map on the company's earnings power today
versus the time that you announced the transaction and how we should think
about that assuming that we go forward to a deal closing here.

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I don't think I'm prepared today to give
you a lot of detail on that, Mike, but I can say this. Look, the companies had
some challenges. We all know that. And it's a bit of a fixer-upper, and we know
that. I'd say we're pleased to have the resolution of this matter behind us. We
want to go forward and close this deal. We want to close it in the next few
months. It's going to be a little unpredictable because they've still got to
file their 10-K, and they need that in order to do a proxy statement to do a
shareholder vote and so forth. So there's some steps to get through here before
we can close, and we've got to finish the divestiture of a couple of businesses
that we'll have to divest because of the regulatory approvals or antitrust
approvals. And I -- what I would say is we're committed, all of us, to get all
of that done in the next coming months here. So I'm looking to close this
hopefully -- and I'm -- and this is just a guesstimate, by end of summer,
allowing for enough time for what Alere's got to do with shareholders and so
forth. But I'd say, look, it remains on strategy. We really like the space. We
like this point of care space. We like the expansion to our Diagnostics
business. We like the businesses. We will divest a couple of pieces. When we
first announced the signing of the deal, that wasn't clear and wasn't known. So
and they had issues with a couple of pieces of businesses, as we know. So I
wouldn't say that the same sales will be there. Obviously, the businesses that
have had problems will either be gone or smaller, and the ones we divest won't
be in the portfolio. So the amount of sales and profits that we add to our
models will change. As far as earnings power and all that sort of stuff, I'm
just not prepared to give at this point. I'd tell you that I think that the
resolution of the matter between us is fair, and it's behind us and we move
forward. And beyond that, I think we're going to have to wait until, first of
all, we're in possession of the company. And obviously, it's going to take us a
bit to get our hands around that. So I'd say, we're not going to really be in a
good position to give a lot of detailed guidance until minimum fourth quarter
and probably normal guidance time. And I know you're going to -- all of our
analysts and investors are going to want guidance before that at some level.
And I think we'll be able to give it at some level within ranges, but I can't
do much detail today.

MICHAEL N. WEINSTEIN: Okay. Let me switch to St. Jude, and
that's where the question people have is relative to the similar warning letter.
So can you give your thoughts on how that warning letter impacts the business?
Any guess at this point on how long you think it'll take to resolve? And I
assume that, that means that the MRI-compatible ICD approval time lines push
out. So given that, are you able to stabilize the business while you're waiting
for the warning letter to lift and for this device to get approved?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I want to be careful not to make
assumptions about things that the FDA gets to decide. I would say this. First,
the warning letter, clearly a disappointment, but not unanticipated. We've been
aware of the circumstances here for some time, and we've been working with our
St. Jude colleagues for some time even before close on GMP matters at the site.
So we got a pretty good head start here on the issues and a fair amount of
dialogue with the FDA about the issues. So having said that and being clearly
disappointed in the outcome, I'd say the impact will depend a lot on our
response, how thorough, how effective that response is. And I can tell you,
we've got an excellent team of people on that. We've basically taken everybody
that is expert in the field in our company, and we have a lot of very good
people in the area focused on and working on not only Somar, but we're doing a
full evaluation across all the sites and make sure that we understand
everything here in detail. We've got a very strong track record ourselves in
GMP performance, et cetera. The FDA is aware of that. So I'd say the
effectiveness of our response, the thoroughness and so forth will determine a
lot of this. Now in the meantime, how fast to resolve, can't really predict.
But I'd say we've gotten a pretty good-sized head start on this. It's not like
we received the letter and said go. We've had a pretty good visibility to all
issues and matters at the site starting last year, and so I think we're well
along here. And with regard to the timing of approvals, the new products that
we have under review with the FDA remain under review. We know that they're
continuing to review those submissions. So that's a good thing, and so I don't
think we can draw any conclusions from that, that are negative or positive. I
think that it's going to depend on the quality of our response here, and I'm
very, very confident in our team. So at this point, I'm not going to change our
launch dates or our assumptions on approval dates and so forth because I don't
see a reason to do that yet or a direction to do it in. And so I think right
now, I'm just going to leave it where it is. And we know that there's some
uncertainty around that. We know that this will depend on our actions at the
site. And we'll see how that progresses, and then I'll have a stronger position
or point of view about that probably later this year. But right now, we're
focused on what needs to be done in terms of corrective actions and
improvements at our site, and that's where the focus ought to be. And then was
-- if that makes clear progress and shows clear effectiveness, then I'll -- I
think it'll be time to try to figure out what impact it's going to have on
launch dates of new products.

MICHAEL N. WEINSTEIN: Okay. Let me ask my last question if I
can, Miles. The discussion on The Street right now, really, I would put it in 2
buckets. It's a question of, okay, what is ultimately Abbott's earnings power
post this deployment of capital and the acquisition of St. Jude and ultimately,
Alere here? And what does that look like? And okay, what is the (inaudible) for
the company? And then the second discussion is really what I was hoping to have
you comment on, which is, okay, what do we pay for Abbott going forward? And
the discussion, essentially, ends up centering around this question of well, is
Abbott's mix of assets today post the acquisition of St. Jude and Alere and the
change of the outlook for the Nutritions business as good as it was 2 to 3
years ago? And effectively, what should we be paying for Abbott today? Could
you give us just your own thoughts on that in terms of the overall quality of
the portfolio today versus 2 to 3 years ago?

MILES D. WHITE: I think the quality of the portfolio today
is clearly strong and improved and better. I think that's an easy one. Geez,
did you tee that up on purpose? If I look back 2 to 3 years ago at -- I'll just
run through the portfolio. I love the Nutrition business. Yes, it has its ups
and downs occasionally, but it is a strong, solid grower driven today,
obviously, by emerging markets in a lot of cases, but it's been a great profit
and cash flow generator, solid business, et cetera, challenges occasionally in
China notwithstanding. The pharma business, our branded generic business, I
think is in a much stronger position than it was several years ago. We're
focused on the markets where high double-digit growth exists. We're seeing it.
We're seeing the execution of that strategy being, I'd say, beautifully
executed by our team. The only headwind we've seen in that is exchange. And
when I can control exchange and predict it for you, we'll do even better. But I
think the EPD business has been a true gem among branded generic pharma
companies, and it's proving it with its growth rates and its performance. We
just keep expanding the product lines, expanding our footprint in countries,
and we keep growing it strong single or low double digits there. I got nothing
but good things to say about that business. Diagnostics is in the process of
launching the biggest range of new systems and new products that's ever been
done in the entire space in history. I used to run the R&D in that business
years ago, and I know the challenges and the complexity of developing big
mainframe systems for diagnostic laboratories, and this team has just launched
4 of them in the market at the same time. These are new systems with full
menus, and it'll be a rolling rollout. But I think when you look at 2 more
systems coming, 6 systems across the board, a complete redo of the entire
product line, I think the strength of that to drive the growth of our
Diagnostics business, gosh, for the next decade, is unprecedented, absolutely
unprecedented. And designed not only for their size, their efficiency, their
cost. I think there's nothing but good there, and nobody's done that. So I'm
extremely enthusiastic about that. And then, Mike, you yourself have challenged
us on the breadth of our Medical Device business for a number of years. And I
think that the addition of St. Jude here is powerful. I mean, arguably, we've
got the best stent in the world, and it's challenging for everybody in this
space to incrementally improve on the efficacy and quality of stents today. We
have a lead position in the stent business, and now we've broadened that across
6 other major cardiovascular categories. And I look back at the last few years
in the Medical Optics business, which, frankly, I think J&J has acquired at
a particularly opportune time because it's taking share in the intraocular lens
space at a pretty nice clip. They've got leading technology, and that business
had its own struggles when we first acquired it. So if I look at Alere and St.
Jude or even parts of Abbott that need improvements or whatever, I think we've
got a very strong track record of improving performance in businesses that need
some improvement. And I look at AMO, I mean, we're very proud of how AMO has
performed over these last 6 years. And I think that was proven in the sale and
value and so forth that J&J saw in it, and I think they're very happy to
have that business. We're very proud of it. We wish it well because we're
pretty happy with how well it did. So I look back 3, 4 years and I think we are
much stronger today and have a much more robust and strong portfolio across the
board. You can say, now aren't there challenges to fix in the business? I think
any large company with diverse set of businesses is always going to have
something to fix. We're always going to have something that's not up to our
standards or that we want to improve on. And then there's always going to be
currency or something going on somewhere in the world. If you're in 130 countries,
there's always going to be somewhere and something. So I look at it, and I
think yes, I'm very pleased with how we've done. And I think that the growth
prospects going forward are stronger than they've ever been. And to be honest,
we start every year with a target of double-digit earnings growth. We -- I
mean, I - there have been, actually in the last 10 or 11 years, maybe 2 years
that were high-single digit. But otherwise, we target double-digit earnings
every year, almost without exception, and that's unusual in our space, and I
think you know that. So at some point, I'd say we're the same company but with
a much better portfolio. And we live to the investment identity that we've been
and created, and that's our intent. That's why we've made the moves we did with
both St. Jude and Alere. And even though that we've got to put some time and
investment into these businesses to help achieve the growth aspirations we
have, you just look at the strength of the portfolios across the board. I don't
think we've ever had rich new product portfolios coming like we see across
these businesses today. So thanks for the question. That was kind of an easy
one.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Matt Taylor from
Barclays.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR, DIRECTOR, BARCLAYS PLC, RESEARCH
DIVISION: A couple areas in the portfolio I wanted to ask about, and the first
one's on Diabetes. You had a really strong quarter. We actually saw some
acceleration in that business outside the U.S., and I was hoping you can make
some comments on, I guess, a, how FreeStyle Libre is doing and what your
expectations are for that in the U.S. If you could give us an update there.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes, no problem. Look, I can say we're
pretty excited about FreeStyle Libre. It's doing very well, doing really well
across Europe. As I mentioned, I think, in my opening remarks, we're in about
30 countries now. The expansion within those countries is going well. I think
we're at about 300,000 patients. I mean, you can compare that to a like competitor,
and I think that stacks up really favorably. We're getting reimbursement across
European countries. That's unprecedented. And even within Germany and other
countries, the reimbursement is expanding. That's helping. In some cases where
it's patient pay, we're still growing very well, patients accepting it. So
we've got both great patient acceptance, great value proposition. And then as
we said, payers, governments, sick funds and so forth, all giving a lot of
support to the product because of the -- not only what it does, but the value
proposition it represents relative to what patients can do today. And it makes
a heck of a difference in the care and treatment of diabetic patients and their
care for themselves. So I think we're pretty excited about this product and the
pace at which it's growing and expanding, nothing but good. As far as the U.S.
goes, still working with the FDA to get approval in the U.S., and submitted,
waiting, excited, anticipating, impatient.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR: Okay, great. Well, and then just on
the St. Jude side of things. There's a few areas that were pretty strong, but
you continue to have some negative growth in rhythm management and heart
failure. I guess my question is, can you stabilize that business before you get
ICD approval? And what are the things that would help that? Maybe you could
comment on the pacemaker launch and how that's going.

MILES D. WHITE: Well, pacemaker launch is going fine. We got
about 75% of our accounts are contracted, about 25% to go. And because it's a
new product, new leads, there's a little bit of training and re-contracting
involved because it's not the same old product. So yes, I'd say that rollout is
going well. It's interesting, you always want it to be instantaneous, and it
takes a little time to roll it in. So I actually expect to see improving
sequential quarters in terms of its growth or decline, where comparing to last
year, when it -- as you know, it lost some share while it waited for approval.
So I expect to see that improve steadily through the year. Obviously, it'll be
helped when our high-voltage is approved. But as I said earlier, I can't make
predictions about that right now. We're hopeful that we'll be able to resolve
matters sufficiently or show enough progress with the FDA that we can stay on
track with that. But I can't predict that just yet, but I think that will make
a difference as well. But I'd say everything is going very well with low
voltage.

MATTHEW CHARLES TAYLOR: Okay, great. And one last follow-up.
I just wanted to clarify. On the Alere time line, there's a few steps here. Do
you think that it's going to basically take kind of through the summer? What's
the soonest it could close? And kind of what are the key uncertainties in that
time line around FTC?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I don't know. I don't want to speak
for Alere because that's -- right now, they and their auditors are working on
their 10-K and so forth. I can tell you, they're just as anxious to get
finished as we are. So that aside, I think we just arbitrarily sort of say end
of 3Q, or third quarter, but it's kind of an arbitrary date. Do I think it'll
take longer than that? No. And I would tell you that both companies will get
there as soon as they can. We got a couple of basic items. I mean, obviously,
we've got our divestitures to finish up, but they will not, I don't think, be
the long pole in the tent here. I think it'll be the shareholder vote, but I
don't know that. I just think that we both got actions to finish up here in
parallel, and we're going as fast as I think we practically can.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Rick Wise from
Stifel, Nicolaus.

FREDERICK A. WISE, MD, STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY,
INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Let me start with China and China
Nutritionals. No surprise, the issues you called out. Maybe help us -- maybe
talk us through some of the steps you're taking now to set the stage for a
better 2018. How confident are you that 2018 will be better? Obviously, you're
going to have some easy comps. Whether it's product or management or other
initiatives, help us sort of frame the outlook as we look ahead there.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes. I'm thinking of how to characterize
that because we're talking about one of the most dynamic markets of any market
I've ever seen in the world. We do have new management, like the management a
lot, very impressed with the experience, the background, the understanding of
the markets, the actions taken, et cetera. I'm pleased with the actions that
we've identified. We're not completely in control of what happens in China, as
you might guess. So we know that there's a lot of inventory in that market. We
know there's a lot of channel shift happening in that market. That takes time
to play through. We believe we've refocused on the appropriate channels. The
digital channel, in particular, has exploded and sucked a lot of the activity
and energy out of traditional modern trade channels and so forth, and that's
been a pretty big shift to us because we have historically been heavy modern
trade. But we have reacted to that, I think, now well. I wish we'd been
quicker, but we weren't. So I think that the team there is making all the right
adjustments in terms of where we promote, how we promote, where we ship, how we
ship, product benefits and value propositions. I mean, literally across the
board, I think our Nutrition business has put a lot of attention on adjusting
to what is, frankly, a fascinatingly dynamic, changing market. We still like
the long-term prospects of China. We look at the growth rates and so forth, and
there's not any big underlying detriments to how strong that market's been.
It's been a lot more the reaction of competitors and all of us to pending
regulation, changes in what the government will allow in terms of number of
SKUs, competitors in the market and so forth. We're actually in a very strong
position for that, given the number of different plants we have, different
products and so forth. But we're focused on only a few very strong products.
And we're focused on the, let's say, the differentiation that moms in China
want in their product. Some of them want European products. Some of them want
New Zealand products. Some of them want American products. Some of them want a
local product, and we actually have that and all of that. So I think it's an
adjustment to a lot of channel, a lot of digital and a lot of product and then
on top of that, a lot of government regulation. And so in this particular case,
there are so many competitors in China. A lot of them have pushed a lot of
inventory into that market in anticipation of a lot of that, and we have to see
that play through. So it's made this year hard to predict. We think we're in a
good position thus far. I mean, I hate to be superstitious. I'll knock on wood
and say right now, China has not been a surprise or an issue for '17, but I
felt that way last year at about this time, too. So I want to see a lot more
this year play out before I can predict how the year is going to finish or even
how '18 will be. But I think we feel pretty good about China for the long term.
But as the government transitions through these new regulations, I think that's
going to be a little bumpy, and it has been. Otherwise, I like the management
team and the actions we're taking right now, and that's about all I can tell
you.

FREDERICK A. WISE: Okay. Turning to guidance. You obviously
beat first quarter, chose not to raise the full year. I think you talked about
timing of spending and some other issues. And when we look at the second
quarter, you sort of basically framed current consensus, as I understand it,
with your EPS guidance anyway. Help us understand a little more behind your
thinking. Is it simply caution as you look at the many moving pieces in terms
of the outlook for the full year? And for second quarter specifically, can you
perhaps walk us through the bridge from first quarter to second quarter, $0.48
to $0.60, the puts and takes that get us up to that kind of ramp in the second
quarter?

MILES D. WHITE: Well, I may have to phone a friend for that
last part, but let me address the first part. You'll recall -- well, first of
all, we set our target for the year at healthy double digits. Now we've got St.
Jude in the mix there, so there's extra healthy double digits. But even on top
of just last year on a comparable basis, there's a double-digit earnings growth
target here, which, again, I would point out, is not typical across our peer
group or competitors, et cetera, or even the companies that our investors
compare us to, many of which are not health care. And so we start the year with
healthy double-digit target and guidance, and then the gating of that guidance
over the quarters. As you may recall in the first quarter, the issue was, gee,
it looks back-end loaded. And our fourth quarter is always strong, and our
first quarter is always the low quarter of the year. And so when you look at
that and you say, okay, the investor tends to think that last quarter, gosh,
that looks like such a big hill. So we have a strong first quarter, that tends
to be the case. We tend to have lower guidance then, and we tend to beat it
each year. It tends to be a pattern. And then there's -- I look at each year a
little superstitiously. I guess if you've been around long enough, you get to
see this. But every year, exchange or something happens later in the year,
where there's a change, there's a political change, there's an exchange
adjustment of some kind or whatever. So I'm reluctant to adjust guidance in the
first quarter for almost anything and -- because I'd like to see the year play
out a little more first because I don't like to whip around the shareholders,
particularly when we're already looking at a double-digit growth target, which
is annual for us. And so I look at it and say, okay, we're off to a nice strong
start. We have had a bit of favorable exchange. We do know there's some timing
in there, and there's also some strength in there. And I'd like to see that
strength sustained, and I'd like to see the exchange sustained. I'd like to see
more than 3 months play out here. So in the meantime, my view would be, let's
take some of the gating off the back part of the year. Let's re-gate this a
little bit more gently, call it a little smoother, and let's wait to see
another card played in the second quarter. I just don't think it's prudent at
this early point in the year to make adjustments to earnings that are already
double-digit targets until we see more cards played. I mean, that's basically
my thought process, Rick. I mean, you can second-guess me all you want, but that's
how I thought about it. Scott's going to -- or Brian is going to help you with
your second question on the quarter.

BRIAN B. YOOR: Yes. The question going from Q1 to Q2, and we
talked a little bit about this on our first call. I mean, as Miles talked about
China, while we anticipate pressures to be there through the year, we're
expecting some relief as we move through the year, not a lot. But obviously,
that comp becomes a little bit easier for us as we move through the year.
That's one area in Nutrition. One area, Rick, and we talked about this, we
expected a lower branded generics sales in Q1, and some of that was around the
anticipation around what they were going through with the process known as
demonetization. Established Pharma, and also, it was our last quarter of sales
in Venezuela, it just so happens, and we talked a little bit about that, too.
This is their last quarter. Established Pharma would have grown 11% to 12% this
quarter had we adjusted for that comparable on Venezuela. So we expect that to
flow through in Q2. You also saw it in Diagnostics, whereas Diagnostics came in
the 4% range, they'd be closer to 6.5% but for Venezuela. So we anticipated all
these moves when we projected our Q2 earnings. And also, I'd note, too, we
expected a very modest contribution from St. Jude in Q1. You have the dilution
from the shares, but it takes time to ramp the synergies. And so as we move
into Q2, you're going to start to see those synergies ramp in St. Jude as we
move through the year. And that's really the bridge to take you from what you
saw, the $0.48 to $0.60.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Glenn Novarro
from RBC Capital Markets.

GLENN J. NOVARRO, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: I wonder if you can provide a little bit more detail on your
CRM performance in the quarter. U.S. was down 18%. Can you break it down
between pacing and ICDs? I would imagine pacing did better given that you have
the MRI-safe approval. And it seems like from the numbers, ICDs came in worse,
so a little bit more clarity on CRM performance in the first quarter.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Sure, this is Scott. As Miles mentioned,
we did make some progress there in the U.S. on the CRM side during the first
quarter. We're off to a good start with the pacer, particularly as we exited
the quarter and started to add it to more and more contracts. And we think
we'll wrap up that process here in the second quarter and do better with the
pacer throughout the year. So the pacer sales were down in the mid-single digits,
and then the remainder would have been, obviously, the performance of the
defibrillation business. We did make some progress there as well. With respect
to filing, we filed the ICD in March, and we expect to file the CRTD here in
the second quarter. So we made progress in terms of approval milestones on that
front as well.

GLENN J. NOVARRO: Okay. And I guess from Miles' commentary,
you're assuming pacers throughout the year get stronger as it fully gets
launched, as doctors get trained. So this is a business that'll go from down 5%
to flat to up throughout the year. Is that a fair assumption? And I guess we
should assume ICDs continue in this downward trend until MRI-safe gets
approved. Is that fair?

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Yes. I think you got it there, Glenn.
Definitely, pacers will improve throughout the year.

GLENN J. NOVARRO: Okay. And then one quick follow-up for
Miles on China. We talked about the challenges in 2017. Once we get through the
regulations, as you go into 2018 and beyond, what's the new norm in terms of
market growth for China? When Abbott and AbbVie split up, Miles, you talked
about China being a double-digit growth market. So what's the new norm in 2018
and beyond for growth in China in Nutritionals?

MILES D. WHITE: This is just a stab in the dark. But I would
tell you, I'd probably for right now forecast it at mid-single. I think we're
going to have to see some -- it's a big number. I mean, first of all, China is
a big market, so we're talking about growth on top of a big number. And so you
got the law of big numbers working against us there. But I'd say mid-single for
now is a safe assumption. And beyond that, I think we're going to have to kind
of see how it goes.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen
from Wells Fargo.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO
SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Let me start with capital allocation, and
then a product-related question. So I think, Brian, when you announced the St.
Jude deal a year ago, you talked about a goal of getting down to 3.5x
debt-to-EBITDA in 2018. Is that still a realistic goal given the Alere deal
now? And how should we think about your uses of cash priorities? One of the
concerns investors have is that with the debt you have right now, that -- or post
the Alere deal, that you'll be constrained and you won't be able to do even
small tuck-in deals to augment, let's say, the St. Jude business or other
businesses. So can you talk a little bit about that? And I had one follow-up.

MILES D. WHITE: Yes, Larry, we see a path to the 3.5 for
2018 in closing Alere. I think something to keep in mind and remember is we
divested a couple businesses, and we received full and fair value there. And so
that gives us some optionality such that the debt we would take on under Alere
is less than what you might have originally modeled in your deal model. So at a
later point in time, we'll come back and help you reconcile that. And as you
know, and we talked about this, cash flow has been a focus for us. We projected
very strong operating cash flow and free cash flow as a percent of net income
for this year, and that remains on track. I'd say, in the first quarter, let's
wait until the Q comes out. But we may even be a little bit ahead here in terms
of our efforts here to make improvements on our working capital process and
also to just further strengthen what was already a strong process around our
capital expenditures. So we feel good about that. Our priority is to go back to
strategic flexibility, and nothing changes about those commitments we made some
time ago.

LAWRENCE H. BIEGELSEN: That's helpful. And then on the
product side, just 2. One is on EPD. You touched upon the demonetization, which
doesn't look like it's had much of an impact based on your Q1 result. But how
are you thinking about the impact of the goods and services tax in India later
this year? And just lastly, on the heart failure results this quarter, which
were a little weak, I think that's primarily the Thoratec business, which has
been strong in prior quarters. Can you talk about the outlook there and why it
might have been weak this quarter? And obviously, you have HeartMate 3 coming
in the U.S. later this year, hopefully, so that should help.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Sure. Thanks, Larry. This is Scott. With
respect to the demonetization, yes, it did have a little bit of transitory
choppiness on the overall economy, quite frankly in India, and we saw a modest
impact on our results. That impact is diminishing and will continue to
diminish, we think, going forward. With respect to the goods and services tax,
as you know, the government's looking at a new -- implementing a new tax
scheme. They have been looking at this for quite some time, so it's not -- the
date has moved once previously, so we are certainly going to monitor that
situation. At current time, the expectation is that they would implement on
July 1. If they do, that could have an impact, potentially, on the way
distributors manage inventory before and after that implementation. So we
didn't bake that into our guidance per se because the time line has been a
little bit fluid here. But if we go through the quarter and that solidifies,
we'll update you at the appropriate time.

MILES D. WHITE: I think it's important to stress, though,
hard to predict what distributors will do to manage inventories and so forth
based on this, but they will at some level. And so we could see some less
predictable numbers in the second -- between the second and third quarter if
the timing is what Scott said, but I don't think it's going to affect our
overall business. And it's going to affect all players in the market, all
manufacturers or all retailers, et cetera. And at the end of the day, I think
it'll stabilize, but we're just going to go through a lumpy start. And then I
think it also depends on whether or not people recover this tax with price or
other things, so we'll just have to see.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: With respect to your question on LVADs
with the heart failure bucket, as you know, that market can be a little bit
choppy from time to time. There's some interplay between LVAD procedures and
the heart transplant procedures, so we saw some of that. We did see, as we
exited the quarter, growth rates start to improve. And as you mentioned, we do
expect to see acceleration in the second half of the year when we bring
HeartMate 3 to the U.S. here. So we're well positioned in that market. We have
a market-leading product. We are -- albeit on a smaller base, we are continuing
to see some nice, strong growth on CardioMEMS as well.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from
Cowen and Company.

JOSHUA THOMAS JENNINGS, MD AND SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST,
COWEN AND COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I was hoping to start just to follow
up on your comments, Miles, on the FDA warning letter. Can you just refresh us
on whether or not there are any non-CRM products that come out of the Sylmar
facility? And then also, you mentioned that the warning letter wasn't
completely unanticipated. How are you feeling about some of the other St. Jude
facilities? And just I think if you could comment specifically on the
neuromodulation facility in Plano, where there was a historic tribulations with
an FDA warning letter.

MILES D. WHITE: Okay. Well, I don't have any comments about
Plano. I mean, I don't have any update for you there. I would say, any time you
get a warning letter or even observations -- 43 observations on GMP at any
facility or any plant, it behooves us to go back and look not only at that
plant, but all of our plants across the board so that the corrective actions we
take, whatever they may be, are consistent. And our systems and processes are
consistent across all facilities. So anytime you get an observation like this
or any observation at a single facility, our practice is to go back and look at
all facilities. And I'm comfortable that we're not sitting here at risk in our
other facilities. But that said, we always go back proactively and preemptively
and look at every facility to make sure that whatever we're correcting in one
is something that we've looked at, checked out, assessed, evaluated, whatever
you want to call it, in all of them. So that's standard practice. And frankly,
I think that's one of the reasons we have the track record we have in GMP in
our facilities and the reputation we have with the FDA. So I think that's a
good thing. So I don't -- I'm not sitting here with a lot of nervousness about
other facilities. We've had a chance to look at all of St. Jude's facilities.
We've had a chance to assess that. Right now, I don't see an indication of
something like this elsewhere. So but that said, we're all over everything in
this -- with this warning letter everywhere. I can't remember what I missed in
the question because it was a long question.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Yes. I would say, with respect to the
products, the most significant products there are the defibrillator and the CRM
products. There are others that are smaller that go through generally a 510(k)
process, but the biggest ones are the defibs that you pointed out.

JOSHUA THOMAS JENNINGS: Understood. I was hoping just to ask
a follow-up question on just the CardioMEMS product line. Are there any updates
on interactions with CMS and the path to national coverage determination? And
just your outlook on that asset. It had been one of the growth drivers, I
believe, when the deal was announced last year, and any update would be
fantastic.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Yes. Our longer-term perspective on
CardioMEMS is unchanged. And we've said that since we announced the St. Jude
acquisition, quite frankly, that we think that there's a lot of long-term
potential here. Near term, we pointed to the fact that there's more work to be
done. We have had interactions with the respective bodies with respect to
CardioMEMS and what it'll take to get in a better position from a reimbursement
standpoint, and those are ongoing. I don't want to get into too many specifics.
But what we have today, the product is growing nicely, growing 20%. Above 20%,
quite frankly, albeit again on a smaller base. So we are making progress with
it. The real-world results that we're seeing, physicians are seeing with it,
are strong, probably better than expected in terms of what most physicians give
us feedback on. So we're happy with the way the product's performing. We think
there's great long-term potential, and we'll work through the process here and
generate the data we need in the near term.

OPERATOR: And our last question comes from David Lewis from
Morgan Stanley.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:
Brian, just a quick follow-up on Alere and 2 fast ones. So is it safe to assume
as it relates to Alere, and I know you're not a giving specific accretion, way
to think about it is we probably have some less synergies based on operating
performance and some of the divestitures, but you've got a lot more financing
flexibility, and that helps to make up the difference. Is that a decent
paraphrase of what we'll see?

BRIAN B. YOOR: It's a decent paraphrase over the coming
year. Once we bring this business under us, that's a fair assessment, David.

DAVID RYAN LEWIS: Okay. And then 2 quick ones. The first is,
Miles, maybe for you, you've talked a lot about India and some on China. I
wonder, just for this new 2 invoice policy in China as it relates to your EPD
business and device franchise, any disruption we should be thinking about this
year? Any changes to distributors regarding the 2 invoice policy? And then if
there's any update on the PHP product within heart failure, that'd be great.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Yes, this is Scott. Within China, we
don't see any disruption. In fact, our EPD business continues to perform
extremely well in China, as does our Diagnostics business, double-digit growth
on both fronts. So we expect strong growth going forward there as well. With
respect to the PHP, we did temporarily pause the trial on commercial implants.
We continue to investigate that, and we'll give an update at the appropriate
time. Very modest financial impact, though. It's a small product.

Okay. Well, good. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you
for all of your questions, and that concludes Abbott's conference call. A
replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central time today on

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's fourth-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. (Operator
Instructions) This call is being recorded by Abbott.

With the exception of any participants' questions asked
during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the
question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be
recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would
now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor
Relations.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER, VP, IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Good morning
and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice President,
Finance, and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and
Brian will discuss our performance in more detail. Following their remarks,
Miles, Brian, and I will take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may
cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements.

Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and
other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A,
Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in our quarterly report on Form
10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016, as well as in St. Jude Medical's
annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, and St.
Jude Medical's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April
2, 2016.

Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any
revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or
developments, except as required by law. Please note that forecast financial
results and guidance provided on today's call for sales, EPS, and line items of
the P&L will be for continuing operations only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing
business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filings from today, which will be available on our website at Abbott.com. Our
commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes
the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.

With that I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES WHITE, CHAIRMAN & CEO, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today I will discuss our 2016 results as well
as our outlook for 2017.

For the full year 2016, we achieved ongoing earnings per
share of $2.20, representing double-digit underlying growth. Continued strong
performance across many of our businesses and operating margin expansion
enabled us to deliver adjusted earnings per share at the upper end of the
initial guidance range we set forth at the beginning of last year.

Importantly, 2016 was a year of significant shaping for
Abbott. We have aligned our businesses with long-term growth trends and it has
been our intention to build leadership positions in all areas of healthcare
where we compete. This past year we took multiple strategic steps to ensure we
are in the right businesses that provide the best opportunities for our future.

I will start with the pending sale of our medical optics
business, or AMO. We entered the vision care business several years ago with
the intent that AMO would be a foundational cornerstone for us to build upon.

Under Abbott, this business performed well, gaining share
and improving operating profitability. However, as we looked over the long term
we didn't see sufficient opportunities for us to build AMO into a more
broad-based leader in vision care. So strategically the decision was made to
strengthen our medical device business in a market that offered the greatest
long-term growth and leadership potential, and that market is cardiovascular
care, one of the largest and most important areas of healthcare.

The recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical creates the kind
of market-leading position we seek in all of our businesses. This includes
strong positions in nearly every area of the $30 billion cardiovascular device
market, including coronary stents, cardiac rhythm management, atrial
fibrillation, and heart failure. And importantly, Abbott now has one of the strongest
product pipelines of the industry. The combined best-in-class portfolio has the
depth, breadth, and innovation to help patients restore their health and
deliver greater value to customers and payers.

So we enter 2017 as a stronger company. The fundamentals of
the markets where we compete remain strong and we have good momentum across our
businesses. We are also entering a period where innovation and new product
launches will fortify our leadership positions. I will touch on some examples
of important new products during my commentary on each of our businesses in a
moment.

As we announced this morning, we expect to deliver strong
financial performance in 2017. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range
of $2.40 to $2.50 reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint.

I will now provide a brief overview of our 2016 results and
the 2017 outlook for each business. I'll start with nutrition, where Abbott is
the global leader in the adult market and maintains leadership positions in the
pediatric market across several geographies, including the number one position
in the United States.

As expected, fourth-quarter sales growth was affected by
challenging market conditions in China, including new food safety regulations
that are set to go into effect in January 2018, and a consequent oversupply of
product in the market. Although we expect market conditions will remain
challenging in 2017, the longer-term fundamentals of the Chinese infant formula
market remain attractive. With localized R&D in China and a world-class
global supply chain, we're well-equipped to navigate this highly dynamic market
with a competitive portfolio of products that are aligned with evolving
customer needs and purchasing channels.

In the US, we continue to outperform the pediatric nutrition
market, driven by several recently launched new products, and we continue to
drive strong growth in both pediatric and adult nutrition in Latin America and
Southeast Asia.

Turning to established pharmaceuticals, or EPD, which
achieved double-digit operational sales growth for both the fourth quarter and
full year 2016. EPD has grown into the business that we envisioned when we
created and further shaped it through a series of strategic actions, including
the sale of our developed markets business and the acquisitions of CFR
Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia.

With leading market positions in several geographies,
including India, Russia, and Latin America, EPD is well-positioned for
sustained above-market growth in some of the largest and fastest-growing
pharmaceutical markets in the world. In 2017, we will continue to execute our
unique operating model which focuses on portfolio selling in core therapeutic
areas where we have well-recognized, highly-trusted brands.

This portfolio approach creates unique channel opportunities
and differentiated relationships with physicians, retailers, and pharmacies
that are looking to offer a complete line of solutions to treat prominent local
health conditions. We continuously refresh and enhance our localized product
offerings through internal development, cross-registration of brands across
geographies, as well as local and regional acquisitions and in-licensing.

In 2017 we will further strengthen our development
capabilities with an expanded EPD innovation center in India. In addition to
developing new drug formulations, dosing, and other differentiated offerings,
the center will act as a hub, shipping products to over 30 countries that will
further develop differentiated products to suit local needs.

In diagnostics, we achieved another year of above-market
sales growth in 2016 and, importantly, we initiated the global launch of
Alinity, an integrated family of next-generation diagnostic systems for every
area of diagnostics in which we compete. The Alinity solutions represent a
major leap forward over competitive systems in terms of automation, throughput,
space efficiency, and ease-of-use, which will help our customers address issues
they face every day including higher testing volumes, constrained staffing and
space, and complex disparate processes and instruments.

In the fourth quarter of last year we obtained CE Mark for
our point of care, immunoassay, clinical chemistry, and blood screening systems
and have initiated the launch of these four systems in Europe. Over the next
couple of years, we will launch the full Alinity suite across Europe and into
additional geographies, including the US, in the 2018 timeframe. This
unprecedented level of innovation is an extremely ambitious undertaking and one
that will strengthen our competitive position tremendously for years to come.

Lastly, I will cover our medical devices business. As I
mentioned earlier, 2016 was truly a transformational year for this business.
The acquisition of St. Jude represents a major strategic move that establishes
Abbott with a premier medical device business comprised of cardiovascular,
neuromodulation, and diabetes care. These represent some of the largest and
fastest-growing areas of healthcare and we now hold leading positions in each
area.

In 2017, our focus will be on integrating the businesses,
achieving the projected synergies and financial targets, and successfully
delivering on new product launches. Our integration approach will bring forward
the best of both companies with a focus on creating a best-in-class
cross-functional organization.

In terms of synergies, we anticipate annual pretax synergies
of $500 million by 2020, including revenue expansion opportunities as well as
operational and SG&A efficiencies. We've modeled the progression of these
synergies as fairly linear over the next four years.

Lastly, 2017 will be an important year for innovation across
our medical device business. In our diabetes care business, growth is being
driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative sensor-based glucose monitoring
system that eliminates routine finger sticks. This system offers convenience,
ease-of-use, and affordability and is a truly differentiated solution for the
large and growing diabetic population.

In 2017, we will continue to focus on driving uptake in
Europe, where we now have over 250,000 users. We received US approval for the
professional use version of Libre in the third quarter of 2016 and we look
forward to bringing the consumer version of Libre to the US market in the
second half of this year.

Other areas where the combined Abbott and St. Jude business
will drive rapid growth and important new product innovations include mitral
valve disease, where Abbott is the global leader in minimally-invasive repair
with MitraClip, and has multiple ongoing development programs in the area of
mitral valve replacement. The combination with St. Jude strengthens our R&D
expertise in this area and broadens our commercial presence.

Atrial fibrillation, where Abbott is now the number two
player in this fast-growth market with a broad portfolio of products, including
the recently launched EnSite Precision mapping system; heart failure, where
Abbott is now the clear global leader in assist devices and is developing other
important heart failure products with great potential to improve outcomes and
reduce costs; and neuromodulation, a fast-growing device market that addresses
pain and movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The addition of St.
Jude adds multiple recently-launched products that will drive continued strong
growth in this business.

So in summary, we delivered on our projections in 2016 and
expect double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2017. Our portfolio
is aligned with favorable demographic trends that are driving growth in
healthcare. Through a series of organic and inorganic strategic actions, we've
built leading positions across all of our businesses. And our broad-based
innovation pipeline has never been stronger than it is today.

With these growth drivers intact, Abbott is well-positioned
to deliver significant growth in 2017 and the years beyond. I will now turn the
call over to Brian to discuss our 2016 results and 2017 outlook in more detail.
Brian?

BRIAN YOOR, SVP, FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Thanks, Miles. Today we reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share
from continuing operations of $0.65, in line with our previous expectations.
Sales for the quarter increased 3.8% on an operational basis, excluding an
unfavorable impact of 1% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased 2.8%
in the quarter.

Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross
margin ratio was 57.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.3% of sales,
and adjusted SG&A expense was 28.3% of sales, all in line with previous
guidance. Overall, as we look back at 2016, we achieved our financial
objectives for the year; including mid single-digit operational sales growth
and margin improvement to once again deliver double-digit underlying adjusted
earnings growth.

Turning to our outlook for the full year 2017. Today we
issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.40 to $2.50, which
reflects double-digit underlying growth of Abbott's base business; accretion
from the acquisition of St. Jude of $0.21; the pending sale of our medical
optics business, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017; and
the expected unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on our operating results
based on current exchange rates.

In terms of our 2017 sales forecasts, please note that all
references to sales growth, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable basis,
which adjusts the 2016 basis of comparison to include St. Jude's 2016 results,
adjusted for the recent sale of its vascular closure business, and exclude sales
of our medical optics business. On this basis, our 2016 sales baseline would be
$25.4 billion and we forecast comparable operational sales growth in the
mid-single digits for the full year 2017. Based on current exchange rates, we
expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full-year
comparable reported sales.

We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 60% of
sales for the full year, which reflects the profitability mix of Abbott and St.
Jude, as well as underlying gross margin improvement across our integrated
business. We forecast adjusted R&D investments of the combined businesses
of somewhat above 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately
30% of sales, which includes expense synergies associated with the addition of
St. Jude.

We forecast net interest expense of around $700 million. The
increase over 2016 reflects debt-related interest expense associated with the
St. Jude transaction, partially offset by deployment of proceeds from the sale
of St. Jude's vascular closure business and the pending sale of our medical
optics business. We forecast a loss of approximately $15 million on exchange
gain loss line of the P&L for the full year 2017 and we forecast around $45
million of nonoperating expense.

Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 16.5% for
the full year 2017. The 2017 adjusted tax rate is lower than our historical
adjusted tax rate of somewhat above 18.5%, which reflects the tax deductibility
of the higher interest expense that I discussed earlier.

Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2017. We
forecast an adjusted earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.44. As you would expect,
synergies associated with the St. Jude acquisition are expected to ramp as we
progress through the year.

We forecast comparable operational sales growth in the low
single digits and, at current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact
from exchange of around 1.5%, resulting in low single-digit comparable reported
sales growth for the first quarter 2017. We forecast an adjusted gross margin
ratio of approximately 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat
above 8% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of around 33% of sales.
Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $210 million in the first
quarter.

Before we open the call for questions, I will now provide a
quick overview of our full-year and first-quarter operational sales growth
outlook by business.

For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast high
single-digit operational sales growth for the full year 2017, with balanced
above-market growth across our key emerging markets, and we forecast low to mid
single-digit growth for the first quarter. In nutrition, we forecast
operational sales growth in the low to mid single digits for the full year 2017
and relatively flat sales growth for the first quarter, with expected
sequential improvement in growth rates as we progress through the year.

In diagnostics, we forecast operational sales growth above
mid-single digits for the full year 2017, driven by continued above-market
performance in the US and international markets, and we forecast low to mid
single-digit growth for the first quarter. In diabetes care, we forecast
double-digit operational sales growth for both the full year and first quarter,
driven by continued strong market uptake of FreeStyle Libre.

And lastly, Abbott's legacy vascular business and St. Jude
have been combined into our cardiovascular and neuromodulation business.
Yesterday we issued an 8-K that provides comparable quarterly unaudited sales
for the first nine months of 2016, which assumes that St. Jude was part of
Abbott in 2016. This morning we provided an additional 8-K to update the
comparable quarterly unaudited sales to include the fourth quarter of 2016.

For the full year 2017, we forecast comparable operational
sales growth in the low to mid single-digits for this business and we forecast
comparable operational sales growth in the low single-digits for the first
quarter.

With that, we will now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan.

MIKE WEINSTEIN, ANALYST, WILLIAM BLAIR & COMPANY: Good
morning, Miles. Couple I want to touch on first. One, can you talk about the
St. Jude performance in the fourth quarter? The St. Jude CRM sales coming in
below it looks like the Street's expectations and the guidance for the first
quarter since Jeff said that business is still struggling from the recall they
had in the third quarter. So if you could touch on the St. Jude performance and
then the outlook there.

And then, second, the overall business, the expectation I
think that Brian laid out was that the business would grow operationally low
single-digits in the first quarter, but then get to mid single-digits for the
year. So if you could just walk us through that, that would be great. Thanks.

MILES WHITE: First comment on St. Jude fourth quarter. CRM I
think has continued to struggle. We can see that in the sales and the share and
so forth. I expect that to be rectified imminently here, shortly.

The good news is we've seen in other markets around the
world, when they've gotten their MRI claim, they have recovered and restored
whatever position they have lost. That has obviously been an overhang for them
for this last year and fourth quarter was no exception. So good news is we
expect that very shortly, but your observation about it was correct.

I will turn to Brian here for a little bit of underlying
detail on your second question.

BRIAN YOOR: Sure, Mike. A step-up in sales throughout the
year is simply what Miles message is: the stabilization of the CRM that we just
talked about on the MRI claim. But also the opportunity to penetrate the
accounts that we have with the combined business together is another
contributor as we go to the market with a much broader presence of products as
the call on the various accounts.

And also, you will note that they had some nice approvals
that we talked about with EnSite Precision, a key driver of growth in atrial
fibrillation, which has been growing in the double digits. We expect a lot of
continued strong growth here.

And there's also a couple key catalysts that we are
expecting as we move through the year, one being CONFIRM, which is in the heart
failure space with atrial fibrillation. We expect that to be a unique
contributor for the patients who have atrial fibrillation.

And then also the continued contribution of neuromodulation.
They recently have the burst technology, which has had a lot of success and we
expect that to continue. And that for our deep brain stimulation as well.

Then, finally, there's one more catalyst and that is
HeartMate 3. It's been doing really well in Europe. They are the leader there.
We do expect an approval of HeartMate 3 in the US as we move through 2017, and that
would be a contributor on the back half.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Okay. Then just quickly on your bridge, if
you would, Brian, the assumed impact from both FX and from the AMO divestiture
for 2017.

MILES WHITE: The assumed -- again, on a comparable reported
sales basis, which Scott and -- we filed an 8-K this morning -- it's 2.5% of
sales on a comparable basis. And then the AMO business will likely have sales
in the first quarter of no more than a couple hundred million dollars, but as
you recall, the full year was about $1.2 billion.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Sorry, I mean EPS.

BRIAN YOOR: Oh, on the earnings per share, de minimis, Mike,
on AMO. It typically is not a big earner in the first quarter, just based on
the pattern of spending. Again, if there is a little de minimis contribution,
that also plays into the moving parts of where we are offsetting the dilution
that we are seeing from the vessel closure divestiture.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Sorry, Brian; I was talking about the
full-year bridge for 2017, the FX headwind. I think in our model that we were
at about $0.08 for FX for the full year. Is that close to what you guys
(multiple speakers)?

BRIAN YOOR: You're in the range; it might be a little bit
north of that, Mike. We are probably closer to a dime.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Okay. And the AMO divestiture, is that still
about $0.11?

BRIAN YOOR: You're right, Mike. Remember this offset to --
the AMO divestiture is $0.11, but we are deploying proceeds, so the net is
$0.07. And that is a complete wash with otherwise what we had a long time ago
with our general-purpose financing, which was also negative $0.07.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Understood. Thank you, guys.

OPERATOR: Matt Taylor, Barclays.

MATT TAYLOR, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Thanks for taking
the question. I wanted to explore I guess some of the trends in nutrition,
because you talked about improvement throughout the year as well there too.
Obviously we know about some of the challenges that you had in China last
quarter and you had some puts and takes in the results this quarter.

Can you walk us through your assumptions for how China fairs
for the early part of the year until you'll have your comps? And then what else
is driving that improvement in nutrition?

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Matt, this is Scott. I will touch on it
very quickly. As you know, market conditions continue to remain relatively
challenging in China for all competitors; it is a market dynamic. We do expect
as we go through the year our performance in that business to improve.
Certainly as we start to lap through some of the impacts that we started to
feel in the third and fourth quarter here of 2016, you will see some natural
improvement, but we also expect our business to improve as well.

If you go outside of China, though, really there's been nice
performance in Latin America and in Southeast Asia. We continue to perform very
well in the US on the pediatric side of the business. And then obviously, as
you know, optically our results have looked a bit suppressed because of our
scale down in Venezuela, so our results and our performance in 2016 actually
are a little bit higher than the print would indicate there as well.

We have a number of initiatives in place in China. We are
well prepared and understand the situation on the ground. We will work our way
through it at the beginning of this year and we expect our growth rates there
to improve throughout the year.

MATT TAYLOR: Great. Then just one follow-up, kind of on that
earlier CRM question; just because MRI is such a big deal. Can you talk about
why you have confidence that I guess the pacemaker approval could be imminent?
And can you give us any update on the timeline for your high-power expectation
for the timing of that approval in the US?

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: I will touch base on the high-power piece
initially. Our updates on that are -- it will be later in the year. We're
looking at about the fourth quarter there for both of those high-power devices.

The pacemaker piece we think is a little bit more imminent.
We've had ongoing discussions with the FDA on that front and we feel like that
one is right around the corner and should start to contribute here fairly early
in the year. But the other two will be second half of 2017 items.

MATT TAYLOR: Great, thanks for the color.

OPERATOR: Rick Wise, Stifel.

RICK WISE, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS & COMPANY: Good
morning, everybody. Hello, Miles. It's hard to resist asking you a bigger
picture question.

Obviously we are witnessing what could be dramatic political
policy changes in Washington. If I listen to the news, it seems like a lot could
have potentially positive impacts on Abbott, but there's some worrisome things
as well: hospital capital spending uncertainty post ACA changes, trade
agreement -- especially some of the trade agreement changes.

I'm just curious; it's hard again to resist asking you how
are you thinking about some of these issues. Are you concerned that this is all
going to be a net plus or negative? How are you adapting, etc.? Especially
given your significant OUS exposure.

MILES WHITE: Yes, it's hard to speculate. I would say, in
general, I'm optimistic and I'd say for a number of reasons. Some of the things
that have been talked about won't necessarily directly affect us. They may
affect a number of multinationals. Obviously, our new administration is
pro-business, but there's a lot of moving parts in that, as you know.

The things I look for that might affect us, I think early on
I think we're all waiting to see if there's a tax reform package that would
allow us the ability to access overseas cash and repatriate cash, etc. I think
that would make a big difference for a lot of multinationals.

I don't really expect to see any changes in the Affordable
Care Act directly affect us as much as I think they will affect other segments
of the healthcare industry or business. And I think a lot of the effort will be
pointed at other segments more than the spaces we are in. At least as far as
that is impacted, we are primarily a diagnostic device company in the United
States and so I think that, to some degree, some of that impact could be
favorable for us.

The other things that I watch going forward is policies that
affect strong dollar, weak dollar, strength of currencies, and so on, because
we are so geographically diverse internationally. I think one of the benefits
-- it's not the primary benefit, but one of the benefits of the St. Jude
acquisition is it does spread and balance us into developed market currencies a
little more than we have been.

In general, I'd like to see stability in the currency
markets for us relative to the dollar, which has been a headwind for us for at
least four years now. And I think that will affect all multinationals.

So while there's a lot of uncertainty around the various
things that this administration appears to be making priorities out of, I'd say
that there's relative few that would impact us early on. And I think the impact
is likely to be favorable, that being primarily tax and/or cash access.

RICK WISE: Turning to a cash flow question, maybe Brian,
you'd want to talk about the cash flow outlook post the St. Jude deal and maybe
any stepped-up initiatives to focus even more on even better cash generation
potential. And help us think what that might mean for debt paydown over the
next couple of years and your targets there.

MILES WHITE: Brian is pointing at me take that question,
Rick. There is a stepped-up emphasis on cash flow definitely and I would say,
look, we've always been a pretty strong cash flow generator and we balance our
use of cash, as you know, among internal CapEx, dividend, share repurchase,
M&A activity, and so forth.

Obviously, for the next little while we're not going to be
putting a lot of emphasis into M&A. We're going to hold back on magnitude
of share repurchase, etc. We're maintaining our dividend, growing it a bit, and
a lot of emphasis will be put on, I'd say, rapid paydown or reduction of debt.
And I think that's kind of a prudent place to be for the nearest term.

So we are being very, very prudent about cash use, cash
flow, etc., internally. I think we can do that for a while here and put
ourselves back in a range where I think a conservative financial company like
us would be and get back to kind of the normal balance. We have slowed the
growth in the dividend. Will we restore that? We will. But we want to get to
some targets, some leverage targets, first and we want to get there rapidly.

And so not only in terms of our internal investments and so
forth that we have, across the board, got a very heavy emphasis on freeing and
generating cash. And I would say generally when we have had even a little bit
of emphasis on that in the past we've done very well. So that definitely is
getting a lot of attention right now.

RICK WISE: Just one last quick one from me on Libre. Libre
is off to a clearly brilliant start in Europe and you said I think second-half
2017 filing the US. How do we think about growth from here and what kind of
label you are hoping for to drive US adoption of the technology? Thanks.

MILES WHITE: Well, it's already filed, but I have to say, to
be honest, the FDA has shifted sand on us a couple times here. And so,
consequently, we are seeking both claims, replacement claim and adjunctive
claim. We are going parallel path on this.

I think that the performance of the product thus far ex-US,
Europe and other countries, has been, frankly, excellent and does have
replacement claim and so forth. I think the potential for the US is
extraordinary and I think not only is the product itself an extraordinary
product, but I think its value proposition is unparalleled. And I think the
reason we have been able to get reimbursement in Europe and drive uptake as
much as we have owes to the fact that reimbursement or governments there
recognize the value proposition in the product as not only impact for patients,
but impact on the cost in the healthcare system.

So I'd say at this point I, clearly, can't predict what the
FDA's timelines and so forth are going to be here, but we are upbeat about the
potential for it.

RICK WISE: Thank you very much.

OPERATOR: Glenn Novarro, RBC Capital Markets.

GLENN NOVARRO, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Good morning,
guys. Just a follow-up on the MRI-safe ICD. Last year St. Jude was telling the
Street approval I think somewhere around the second quarter of 2017. You're now
saying fourth quarter of 2017. Can you talk to us about what's creating this
delay? What's the hold up at the FDA?

MILES WHITE: I think you're referencing -- I think you're
confusing two different products possibly here, which is high-volume versus --
high-voltage versus low-voltage. In effect, we are telling you we expect the
low-voltage, which is the primary bulk of use, imminently here -- which you
could read first quarter, not second quarter -- and high-voltage later in the
year. Two different areas.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Yes, I'd just add to that as well.
Obviously, we've been working with them on the low-voltage piece. There's a bit
of a gating factor and these things generally run in parallel as well. So those
discussions overlap and the process overlaps (technical difficulty) as well, so
there's some sequencing to that.

I will say on all of these timing items that I gave around
the MRI-safe, all of those were contemplated along those lines in our DM model,
so there's nothing different in our DM model relative to those timelines.

GLENN NOVARRO: All right. I guess for some reason I thought
they were assuming a 4Q 2016 pacemaker MRI-safe approval and a 2Q 2017 MRI-safe
ICD approval.

But let me just ask you one other question. The cash
proceeds that you're getting from selling the medical optics business to
J&J and the cash proceeds that you've received from the asset sales to
Terumo, have you applied that to your 2017 guide? In other words, are the cash
proceeds being used to pay down debt or is it -- are we waiting to get more clarity
on Alere? Thanks.

MILES WHITE: No, we're not waiting for more clarity. We have
pretty much applied it to our entire borrowing scheme, etc. No surprise. We've
been able -- we sort of as we went into this have planned for many different
paths and outcomes, so it's contemplated in our financing.

GLENN NOVARRO: Okay, great. Thanks for the clarity, guys.

OPERATOR: Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.

LARRY BIEGELSEN, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES: Good
morning, thanks for taking the questions. First, on EPD and diagnostics, the Q4
guidance was a little softer than the full-year 2017 guidance. Can you talk
about what's driving that and what drives the acceleration?

Just second for me, Brian, can you talk a little about the
margin profile of the Company beyond 2017? The guidance you gave for this year
implied it might average right about a 22% operating margin and a better gross
margin than we expected. Just a little color on how to think about the margins
going forward, thanks.

BRIAN YOOR: Sure. Larry, I'm going to assume when you were
talking about established pharma you are referring to the Q1 guidance, and it
is a little bit low. In 2016 it was the last and it was just the timing of when
these shipments are received, some essential medicines into Venezuela. So that's
just causing the last of our quarters of comps here.

They will step up right to the growth rates we have been
accustomed to seeing for several quarters now, which has been high single, even
double digits, based on the strength of this business. That's with respect to
EPD.

With respect to the margin and how to think about it, there
definitely is the impact of bringing in St. Jude into the mix and that provides
some natural accretion there. You are probably in a very tight range there with
what you referenced in terms of a profile of 22%. I think of the expansion over
2016 being roughly half mix, but also synergies. Keep in mind we're going to
improve the profiles that historically St. Jude have had and those will ramp
significantly in Q2 and even further from there as we move through the year.

Then, finally, gross margin, as you know, and operating
margin has always been a focus for us. If you want to deliver double-digit
underlying base earnings growth, you are going to be naturally in that 70 to 80
bps of range based on mid single-digit top-line growth.

LARRY BIEGELSEN: Brian, thanks for that. On the diagnostic
business, I didn't hear you comment as to why, if I heard the guidance
correctly, you expect low to mid single-digits in Q1, but greater than mid single-digit
for the full year. If you could just comment on that, that would be great. And
that's it for me. Thanks, guys.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: What we anticipate in diagnostics, which
as Miles mentioned in his prepared remarks, is some really strong growth. In
particular as we hit the second half of the year and Alinity really starts to
gain some traction and we gain access to some contracts on that front. So
there's some natural strength there in the back half of the year.

In the first half of the year, the first quarter, what you
are seeing -- to Brian's point on EPD, there was a smidgen of Venezuela in the
first quarter of 2016 in diagnostics and you are also seeing some of that at
last scale down within our genetics business, which is well-known and as expected
in our molecular diagnostics business as well. So it's more of a comparable
item there; the underlying strength of that business is strong and it will
actually pick up steam as we head out through the year.

LARRY BIEGELSEN: Thanks for taking the questions, guys.

OPERATOR: Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank.

KRISTEN STEWART, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Just a modeling
question, then a big picture question. For the interest expense line item I
think you're modeling about $700 million for the full year. That does include,
I think, some of the debt that was taken out for Alere. What are you assuming
with that for the balance of the year in terms of redeployment?

Is that assuming you're going down to pay down debt or share
repurchase? Or how should we just think about that to the extent Alere does
come in or doesn't come in, in terms of accretion?

BRIAN YOOR: Kristen, the way to think about the build of the
$700 million is we took out $15 billion of debt for the St. Jude transaction
and I think that was some around 3.75%. Keep in mind, too, we are also assuming
some debt from St. Jude as well. That was a contributor to the addition of
debt. And we just had our ongoing normal debt that had interest on it for
Abbott.

When you add all those things up, and then to Miles's point,
say that we said we are contemplating the deployment of proceeds from the
divestitures that we talked about, that's is how you net out to the $700
million.

KRISTEN STEWART: Okay, great. Then I guess big picture for
Miles, you had mentioned obviously earlier in the remarks this is a significant
year of shaping for Abbott. Certainly think we can all agree to that; it's been
several years of shaping.

As you look over the next three to five years, how do you
just think about Abbott overall? Is it likely that we will see another
reshaping of the mix? Any thoughts on further divestitures of the businesses or
potential, I guess, breakups?

I know you are, obviously, putting a lot in 2017 here, but I
guess how do you just think about the evolving healthcare environment and kind
of macro environment now relative to the mix of your businesses? Thanks.

MILES WHITE: Well, I'd put this in a little bit of context.
When we spun off AbbVie, which has now been four years ago, there was a lot of,
call it, post-separation cleanup to do. We had to take the attendant overhead
in the company down; finish the back-office operations and so forth with
AbbVie.

And as you know, we did want to reshape some of our
portfolio. We sold the developed market generic drug business to Mylan and we
acquired CFR and Veropharm, so we made a number of moves that we think
positioned the EPD business very strongly. We had great organic internal
investments in diagnostics and strong business that really wouldn't benefit
from a lot of M&A in nutrition.

And the weaker part of the Company that got attention from
analysts, investors, and others that we believe needed strengthening as a
fourth leg of the Company, was medical devices. And with the St. Jude
acquisition, we think we've pretty directly addressed that. And having placed
our investment on the cardiovascular health segment, which we believe is pretty
important, we determined we didn't have the same opportunity in medical optics
to build and add on and grow onto that, like in this case J&J would, so we
divested that.

Now, at this point, having made all those significant
changes, we look at the Company and say we've got four very strong sectors that
are very well-positioned in their respective product markets and their
respective geographic markets. Our challenge, or at least opportunity, now
looking forward for the next few years is integrate St. Jude and, frankly,
focus on the organic pipelines of new products coming and execute so that we
can see the growth benefit of the strength of these four segments around the
world in their various segments.

We want to see growth out of ADG for all these new systems.
We want to see the growth out of St. Jude and our vascular business for their
new products. Obviously the same with EPD, which has got a very good sustained
growth track. And same with our nutrition business.

So I'd say we're going to be focused pretty operationally
here for the next several years. That's our intent. I think, when you go
through a phase where you've made a number of transactions, people get very
transaction-focused. And we are still an operating company and that is what we
intend to be here is an operating company. Operate them very well and grow the
targets that we've grown.

We have always had double-digit earnings targets and we've
positioned ourselves in growth markets, both product and geographically, for
the purpose of sustaining that identity for investors to grow -- be
double-digit earnings growers and so forth. And with the new product pipelines
and the strategic positioning of the Company, I think we are extremely
well-positioned to deliver on that. So that's going to be our focus for the
next few years.

KRISTEN STEWART: Okay. You've certainly made a lot of
individual purchases in the stock, so clearly I guess that expresses your view
on what the future holds.

MILES WHITE: I'd say it very much expresses my view on what
the future holds. You always hear these comments about alignment with your
shareholder; I am a shareholder and I believe that the stock represents excellent
value. That's why I bought the shares.

KRISTEN STEWART: Perfect, thanks very much.

OPERATOR: Bob Hopkins, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

BOB HOPKINS, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thanks very much
for taking the questions. First question is I just wanted to make sure I
understand the fourth-quarter growth rates in a little bit more detail. Would
you be willing to give us what was the sort of core legacy Abbott growth rate
this quarter, ex Venezuela? I know it was 3.8% organically, but how much did
Venezuela detract from that?

BRIAN YOOR: Our core growth rate, excluding Venezuela, would
have been around 5%.

BOB HOPKINS: And most of that drag goes away in Q1?

BRIAN YOOR: As we discussed earlier, we will have bits and
pieces in EPD mainly, but then we are through it.

BOB HOPKINS: Okay. Then two other quick things. I was
wondering if you could give us for the fourth quarter, what was the legacy
growth rate of St. Jude's revenue base kind of ex divestitures. I was just
curious what a clean revenue growth rate was for St. Jude in the fourth
quarter.

BRIAN YOOR: A clean growth rate, it was in the low single
digits, on the upper end of that; around 2.5% or so. We expect, obviously, as
we go through the year with some of the launches, with the approvals on the MRI
side, with EnSite Precision, and some of these other innovations that are
coming, as well as with some of the modest revenue synergies that we have baked
in initially that will ramp over time that the St. Jude combined business with
ours should accelerate growth here in 2017 over 2016.

BOB HOPKINS: Then just lastly really quickly. On 2017 two
quick things: one, the EPS guidance for the first half was a little bit below
where the Street was. Can you help us understand the cadence of the earnings
power over the course of the year? Like maybe what percentage of the earnings
is in the back half, just given that that Q1 number was a little bit below what
we were thinking?

Then also, I was just wondering if you could give us your
view on Abbott's opinion of the outlook for the growth rate of the ICD market
as we look forward to the 2017, given that that has been obviously challenged
of late. Thank you.

BRIAN YOOR: Let me take the first one here, Bob. I think
it's safe to assume that you are going to have greater than 50% on the back
half of the year. And also contemplating that is the benefit of this financing
also that we talked about. A combination of that, the deployment of our
proceeds to generate benefit and synergies ramp is just going to naturally put
you into a stronger second half versus the first half.

The other thing in the first quarter I'd just note is that
when you think about the FX impact, it has a modestly heavier impact on Q1
relative to the other quarters. So we feel comfortable with this ramp; we know
the places are in piece. Some of them are just simply the comps.

BOB HOPKINS: And then on ICDs?

BRIAN YOOR: We expect that market to be relatively flat as
an overall market, which would be a little bit of price down offset by some
modest volume.

BOB HOPKINS: Thanks very much for taking the questions.

OPERATOR: David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.

DAVID LEWIS, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Good morning. Maybe
two quick ones for Brian and then one strategic question for Miles.

Brian, two questions. It's been a long time since we got the
first synergy number, almost a year. Any greater clarity post close of St. Jude
how you are thinking about that synergy number, either the mix of revenue or
cost synergies; the absolute size of that number; and the cadence over the next
couple years?

BRIAN YOOR: David, nothing really. We said it was going to
be linear, fairly linear. We talked about the mix being heavier on the SG&A
side initially and then the revenues ramping over time.

I'd say the difference about us versus just putting a
revenue or, excuse me, a full synergy number out there is we go out and
identify these relatively fast as part of our normal acquisition due diligence.
So those are well in place; they are in plans to be executed. We hope to do a
little better maybe in the first year than what we said in linear, but we'll
see how that plays out over the year.

DAVID LEWIS: Okay. And I know you and Miles both stressed
free cash flow earlier on in the call. Is there any kind of target, either in
2017 or 2018, as a percent of net income we should be thinking about in terms
of free cash? That's a question for Brian.

Miles, I just think given what happened earlier this week,
it's pretty interesting; the two best consumer-oriented device companies were
probably yourselves and J&J. They're buying one of your consumer-based
franchises, but they announced they want to get out of their other
consumer-facing diabetes franchises. Can you just talk about how you see the
diabetes franchise going forward and why you think that's the right consumer
franchise for Abbott to stay in versus ophthalmology where you made a different
decision?

Those two and I will jump back in queue. Thank you.

MILES WHITE: I would say we are in kind of a unique position
relative to a lot of the traditional competitors in this space in diabetic
glucose monitoring. In the past, the four major competitors there -- and
there's always a lot of other smaller ones -- it has been a finger prick and a
little chip business. We have a unique position here with Libre that is a
completely different product that eliminates the need for that fingerstick and
gives a continuous glucose read that is, frankly, impactful for the patient,
both type 2 and type 1, in a very different way.

I think that puts us in a unique position to see a
transformation of that market and to benefit from it, if not lead it. Others
don't have that and I think that the competition in what I will call the
traditional part of the market and the commodity nature of it, the economics of
it have clearly changed negatively in the past couple of years. Ironically,
J&J kind of led that.

In our case, we've got a different position with Libre that
I think gives us a unique platform to benefit as one of the disruptors. And
going forward, I believe that platform has possibly utility for us in other
testing segments. In our case, we see a growing business that as we replace the
traditional fingerstick business -- not only ours, but others -- I think
there's an opportunity there that is a real growth opportunity and a very
valuable one.

DAVID LEWIS: Okay. Then, Brian, just on free cash. Is there
a decent percentage to think about, maybe this year or next year, as a percent
of net income that the free cash generation can be?

BRIAN YOOR: David, let me provide some context, too. I think
you saw our cash flow from 2015. I think with all the things that Miles
mentioned of emphasis you should expect to see a little bit of a step up when
you get to the K in 2016 showing the step function of the efforts we are making
here on free cash.

You know, it's tough to completely model out what the
ongoing, sustainable I'll say free cash flow conversion is to net income in the
early years with an integration. But if you look at St. Jude, they are a very
powerful cash earner. We're excited about bringing that into the portfolio.

If you take away the one-time things that are transitory,
David, if you go with an integration, be that expense or capital that bears
fruit long term, we will probably be in that competitive range that you see
others. Probably somewhere in that 70% to 80% range; that's probably what we
target.

DAVID LEWIS: Great, thanks so much.

OPERATOR: Matt Miksic, UBS.

MATT MIKSIC, ANALYST, UBS: Thanks for squeezing me in. Just
one follow-up here. I know there's been a number of questions on MRI and St.
Jude, but maybe just a couple of clarifications, if I could.

We hear some different expectations in the field around
these low-power pacer leads. If you could just clarify whether this is a new
lead system you're waiting on, which was our original understanding, or whether
we should expect the pending approvals to relate to labeling on existing leads.
It's a nuance that obviously could make a difference as we think about the
ramp. And I have one follow-up.

MILES WHITE: Our initial expectation will be a new lead and
I think that is a strong position for us. We like that. But we are also seeking
approval on the existing lead so that we can provide that as well for existing
patients.

But I think going forward we like the notion of a new lead
and so we expect the initial approval here to be that.

MATT MIKSIC: Great. Then the follow-up, just Miles or Scott,
if I could on EPD. Just one of the things we get often, questions we get often
is just around the sustainability of this growth that you have seen; impressive
high single, low double-digit. It would be helpful if you could shed some light
on maybe what we can -- the drivers of that business: how we can think about
sustainability; what potential future growth drivers could be to carry this into
2018 or beyond would be very helpful.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Matt, this is Scott. That business has
been delivering at a high level here fairly consistently for years, quite
frankly. Since it's been reshaped.

The demographics in these markets are aligned with growth
for the long term. The model that we operate, quite frankly, is quite unique.
There's not another multinational company or local company, quite frankly, that
operates the model that we operate with the variety of shareholders, including
the trade channel, which is a very powerful channel for us.

So given the demographics in the model we operate and the
strong brands that we have, we see this growth rate as highly sustainable over
the long term.

MATT MIKSIC: And that's through sort of -- is it portfolio
expansion of that product? Is it also geographic expansion on that sort of core
model that you're describing?

MILES WHITE: You've got several drivers of growth, Matt.
First of all, the call it growth or emergence of a middle class in a lot of emerging
markets -- remember this business is 100% focused in what we would characterize
as emerging markets. The middle class income growth and the growth of their
healthcare systems alone is a major underlying growth driver.

Most of these markets are not reimbursement-driven; they are
consumer-driven and have a model that is both a combination of call it
medically-driven through the physician or consumer-driven through the patient
and the pharmacist. So all the drivers of that growth and the distribution structure
and so forth say this has got strong underlying growth.

I would say it's target-rich for geographic expansion in
addition and beyond that portfolio expansion, so a lot of our organic effort
internally is driven toward expansion of key areas, expansion of product,
formulation innovation on product, and distribution management. And in a lot of
these countries where we are the leader, we are a leader with not that big a
share.

So you get all the benefits of being a leader on the shelf,
leader in distribution, leader in breadth, etc., with a lot of potential
expansion in share gain as well. So all of the various factors that would drive
growth are pretty favorable in these geographies and product areas that we have
targeted.

MATT MIKSIC: That's great, thank you.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Thank you, operator, and thank you for
all of your questions. That concludes Abbott's conference call.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to Abbott's third-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. (Operator
Instructions). This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any
participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the
entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express
written permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, Investor Relations.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER, VP OF IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Good
morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Freyman, Executive Vice
President, Finance and Administration; and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice President,
Finance, and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and
Brian will discuss our performance in more detail. Following their comments,
Miles, Tom, Brian and I will take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties
that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the
forward-looking statements.

Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and
other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A,
Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and in our quarterly report on Form
10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016.

Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any
revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or
developments, except as required by law.

Please note that third-quarter financial results and
guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS, and line items of the
P&L will be for continuing operations only.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP
financial measures will be used to help investors to understand Abbott's
ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled
with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and
regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at
abbott.com.

Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales
growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, unless otherwise noted.

As you'll recall, Abbott issued a press release on April 28,
2016, announcing the transaction with St. Jude Medical, and a related press
release on October 18, 2016. Please refer to those releases for additional
important information about Abbott, St. Jude, and related matters.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES WHITE, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Okay.
Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today we reported adjusted earnings per share of
$0.59, at the high end of our guidance range. We also raised the midpoint of
our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.19
to $2.21, exceeding the initial guidance we set at the beginning of the year.

Sales increased 4% in the quarter, or more than 5.5%
excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth was led by strong performance in
established pharmaceuticals and medical devices. We achieved our expectations
overall and our pipeline continues to deliver a steady cadence of new product
approvals and launches that are contributing to growth.

At the same time, we continued to actively and strategically
shape our portfolio. In September, we took the next logical step in shaping our
medical device business with the announcement that we will sell our medical
optics business to J&J. This action is in line with our strategic decision
to sharpen our focus on building leadership in cardiovascular devices.

I will now briefly review our third-quarter results, and I
will start with diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 5.5% in the quarter
driven by continued above-market performance in core laboratory and
point-of-care diagnostics.

In August, at the American Association for Clinical
Chemistry Conference, we unveiled our next-generation suite of instruments
called Alinity. The Alinity suite includes new instruments for every segment of
the diagnostics market in which we compete. Over the next few months, we'll
launch new systems for point-of-care, immuno-assay testing, clinical chemistry,
and blood screening in Europe. Over time, we'll introduce additional systems
and launch the full Alinity suite into additional geographies, providing a
highly differentiated platform for sustainable, long-term growth.

In nutrition, sales declined 1% in the quarter, below our
expectations, due to soft performance in China pediatric nutrition. As you may
recall, I expressed caution on the near-term outlook in China in our last
earnings call. Over the last few months, market conditions have remained
challenging there, including rapid channel shifts and new safety regulations
that are driving an oversupply of product in the market, and aggressive levels
of discounting.

Although conditions are expected to remain challenging in
the near term, the long-term fundamentals of the market remain attractive. We
have the right portfolio of products for the various channels, and the
best-in-class global supply network. We have also continued to focus on
strengthening our competitiveness in order to deliver growth over the long
term.

Outside of China, we continue to perform well in Southeast
Asia and Latin America, and again achieved above-market growth in US pediatric
nutrition.

In medical devices, sales growth in our vascular business
was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the
minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation; and high-single-digit
growth in endovascular products, driven by vessel closure products and Supera,
our unique stent for the treatment of blockages in the leg.

During the quarter, we received FDA approval for Absorb, the
only fully dissolving vascular stent, and an important addition to our
drug-eluting stent portfolio.

In diabetes care, international sales growth of more than
20% was driven by continued consumer uptake of our revolutionary FreeStyle
Libre system in Europe. In September we received FDA approval for our FreeStyle
Libre Pro system in the United States. Libre Pro will help healthcare
professionals make better customized treatment decisions for their patients,
and at a significantly lower cost than other professional continuous glucose
monitoring systems.

We also submitted the consumer version of the FreeStyle
Libre system for FDA review during the quarter. This system is designed to
eliminate the need for routine fingersticks, and provides glucose data in a
simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health
outcomes.

And in established pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales grew 9% in
the quarter. Double-digit growth in key emerging markets was led by strong
growth in India, China, and Latin America. EPD continues to execute at a very
high level, and remains well aligned with the fundamentals, driving long-term
growth in emerging markets, a rising middle-class, improving access to
healthcare, and consumers that are seeking and willing to pay for high-quality
brands.

So in summary, we achieved our financial expectations for
the quarter, and our diverse business model continues to deliver reliable
growth. We've continued to advance our leadership and competitive position
through several new product approvals and launches across our businesses, and
we continued to take strategic steps to shape our portfolio, building
leadership positions for long-term growth.

I will now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our
results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?

BRIAN YOOR, SVP OF FINANCE AND CFO, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Okay. Thank you, Miles. Sales for the quarter increased 4% on an operational
basis, that is, excluding an unfavorable impact of 1.1% from foreign exchange.
Reported sales increased 2.9% in the quarter.

Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross
margin ratio was 57.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales,
and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.7% of sales, in line with our prior
guidance.

Turning to our outlook for the full-year 2016, we narrowed
our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.19 to $2.21. The midpoint
of our guidance range reflects double-digit underlying growth, offset by the
impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We continue to forecast
operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full-year 2016. Based
on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact,
somewhat above 2% on our full-year reported sales. This would result in
reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full-year 2016.

We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of
around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin
improvement initiatives across our businesses. We also continue to forecast
adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A
expense of approaching 31% of sales for the full year.

Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016, we
forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 to $0.66, again reflecting
double-digit underlying growth. We forecast operational sales growth of mid
single digits in the fourth quarter.

We have now annualized the significant strengthening of the
US dollar that began late in the second quarter of last year, and at current
exchange rates we expect a favorable impact to sales from exchange of somewhat
more than 50 basis points in the fourth quarter.

Turning to other aspects of the P&L for the fourth
quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57%,
adjusted R&D investment somewhat above 6.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A
expense of around 28% of sales. And finally, we project specified items of
$0.25 in the fourth quarter.

Before we open the call for questions, I will now provide a
quick summary of our fourth-quarter operational sales growth outlook by
business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast high-single-digit sales
growth. In nutrition, we forecast sales growth similar to the third quarter. In
diagnostics, we forecast mid-single-digit growth.

And lastly, in our medical devices business, for vascular we
forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In diabetes care, we forecast
double-digit sales growth. And in medical optics, we forecast low- to
mid-single-digit sales growth.

With that, we will now open the call for your questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan.

MIKE WEINSTEIN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Let me start with
nutritionals, Miles. That's now your challenged business, so to speak. Could you
just spend a few more minutes on China? What you are seeing playing out in the
market, and how much of what is playing out today is transient versus a
longer-term or structural change?

MILES WHITE: Yes, I'll try to. I'd say the market in China
has been in a bit of a transition for a number of months, it would appear,
maybe even a little more. And it depends on who you are and what channels
you're in and so forth, depending on how it affects you.

We expected this year to see 7% to 8% growth in China, slightly
above the GDP growth, et cetera. And what we're seeing now is flat to low
single digits, and I think some of our competitors have reported the same. So
we've gotten some triangulation on just underlying market growth rate.

But beyond that, a number of dynamics are at work here.
There's some pretty rapid channel shift from traditional channels like modern
trade to various e-commerce channels and so forth. And I don't think that's
surprised anybody in terms of just overall trends. But the speed and magnitude
of it I think has hit China differently than what you'd see in the US or other
countries. And so that's been a pretty big chunk.

In the process of that, what has happened is some
inventories have piled up in, let's say, traditional channels while the market's
needs have been satisfied by e-commerce channels. And so, the market has got to
burn through that, I guess to some degree, so we've seen growth slow.

And in our case, there's been a loss of about 0.5 share
point, we estimate. We're also seeing a fair amount of market and competitor
reaction to the anticipated new food safety laws which will become effective in
a little over a year, in January of 2018.

Those new laws will limit the number of brands per
manufacturing plant per competitor, et cetera. All products have to be
re-registered, and so on. And the government has got a number of goals for
that, but I think what's at work here is we're seeing a lot of competitors
oversupply this market. And under those scenarios, you see a lot of
discounting.

So, we're seeing that. We're seeing the discounting. We're
seeing the channel shift. We're seeing slower growth there. I do think it's
transitional. I do think it's transient, but I don't think it's going to be a
quick adjustment.

I'm cautious for 2017 because I think that it's a little
hard to predict the reaction of the many competitors and many brands in the
market to these new food safety laws.

So, I think what we're seeing here could be with us for a
while. But I think the long-term attractiveness of the market is definitely
there because there aren't fewer moms, there aren't fewer babies, et cetera.
But we're in kind of an odd transition period that I don't think was
anticipated by the government's intent with its new food safety laws or,
frankly, even the channel shift.

So, I know that's kind of a long-winded answer, but there's
a lot of things stacked up here happening at the same time. We have watched the
results of some of our competitors and see that it hit all of us, but all of us
kind of differently, depending on what channels we might be more prominent in.
And taking that apart and trying to understand all the dynamics there I'd say
has been a key focus of the last couple of quarters here, and I think we've got
a pretty good handle on what's happening. But I think it's going to be this way
for several quarters.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Understood. I'm going to just ask a question
about 2017. And Miles, I know you are not going to give 2017 guidance, but I
just want to think about the framework for it. When we had the call to announce
the St. Jude acquisition, and then on the call that you and I had back in June,
you talked about the goal of the Company historically of delivering
double-digit underlying EPS growth, which is to say that's 10%; and that the goal
for 2017 would be to try and deliver that. And then on top of it, you get the
accretion from the transactions. Obviously we don't know yet what's going to
happen with Alere, but it looks like St. Jude is on track to close.

If we think about the base business piece of that, given
that nutritional is obviously looking weaker than it was six months ago; the
device business is looking better, so there's some pluses and minuses -- is the
underlying business on track to deliver 10% next year? And is the right way to
think about 2017 the underlying 10%-plus the accretion, or should we back off
of the underlying expectations? Thanks.

MILES WHITE: Well, I'd say, first of all, you're right. It's
too early to be giving 2017 guidance, or even be able to be precise about it.
But I would say, look, the underlying growth does continue to be strong in our
businesses. Fortunately we are very diverse -- many companies, many businesses,
many products, many geographies -- and we are not that overindexed in China in
any particular case.

So, I can't say that I think the China pediatric business is
going to be great growth next year. But I don't think it's going to impact, in
a fashion, the overall strength of the growth of the Company globally.

So I'd tell you that I see the underlying growth continuing
to be strong. Clearly that will have some impact on us. But at this point, I
think we're seeing great growth in our pharmaceutical business. We're in the
midst of preparing to launch a number of new systems and diagnostics. FreeStyle
Libre, I'd say, is going gangbusters in Europe, and we're looking forward to
having that in the US shortly. There's a lot of new product launch and approval
happening, so there's a lot of drivers of growth here.

And, frankly, I think there's a lot of growth to be seen in
St. Jude as well. So, I remain kind of in the same position. I know we've got a
slower situation in China. But I don't see us as so overindexed in China that
that is somehow going to knock us back in a way that I can forecast for you right
now, that this is going to have a huge impact on the Company next year.

Frankly, if it was going to have a huge impact fashion,
you'd have seen it this quarter, and we did. We've seen it in our China
numbers, but look at how the Company performed. We exceeded our expectations
yet again.

And owing to the strength and the diversity of the Company
and the strength in pharmaceuticals, the strength in medical devices -- I can
remember a couple of years ago, we were talking about medical devices as the
weakness, not so much the strength. So, I'd say the good news is we got a lot
of parts of the business that are performing well, if not better, in the midst
of new product cycles and launches. And, frankly, the other parts of nutrition
are doing reasonably well.

If you look at the US -- which I think everybody has become
accustomed to ignoring in the numbers -- the US is having a better year than
planned, better year than in a long time, and it's better than solid. So, I
think there's a lot of things happening that offset China to some degree, so
I'd caution this way: I'd say, look, we always start the year looking for
double-digit earnings growth. And, yes, we will have the addition of St. Jude
on top of that. And as you said, Alere remains to be seen.

But in any case, I'm not in a position yet where I can say,
no, I've got different expectations for 2017. I actually think the underlying
growth continues to be strong, and everything tracking according to
expectations on strategic moves otherwise.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Perfect. I'll let some others jump in. Thank
you, Miles.

OPERATOR: Glenn Novarro, RBC Capital.

GLENN NOVARRO, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Miles, two
questions on St. Jude. The deal is on track to close by the end of this year.
But in the third quarter you had a cyber security report issued. You had St.
Jude issue an advisory regarding battery depletion of some of its older [ICs].
I know you've been in contact with St. Jude, but maybe talk about what gives
you the confidence that these issues will not impact St. Jude's business, post-
the deal close. And then I had a follow-up.

MILES WHITE: Well, what I'd tell you so far is I think the
St. Jude has handled all this pretty well, pretty thoroughly; and not only in
terms of their taking it seriously, their own investigations, the third-party
consultants and investigators that they've worked with and employed. I have to
say they definitely put patient safety and patient credibility and physician
credibility and the product performance and so forth, first, and that's right.
And I think they've done all the right things. They've been in great
communication with us.

And based on everything that we know, I don't see this
impacting the close of the deal, or the business long-term. I've seen a lot of
speculation in the press. And every time there's a product issue or a hiccup or
whatever it may be, everybody wants to run to the headlines and speculate about
the deal. I'll tell you, based on everything I see, this deal is going to
close. And determined by the timing of the regulatory approval, it's probably
going to close by year end. And I haven't seen anything to date that would
suggest otherwise.

Regarding the performance of the company after that, I'll
tell you honestly, what I'm most anxious for is for their MRI compatible claim
to be approved by the FDA in the US. And frankly, if you look at the rest of
their businesses, they are all growing at a pretty healthy rate, and
particularly overseas. And I think their success overseas has demonstrated that
when they do get their MRI compatible claim in the US, that their recovery of
share, recovery of growth rate, et cetera, there should be pretty strong. So, I
haven't changed my expectations about the performance of St. Jude going
forward.

And I can probably someday give you my opinion about the
current circumstances with the cyber security claims and so forth. But I'll
keep my thoughts to myself right now, and we'll wait till the deal is closed.

GLENN NOVARRO: Okay. And just a quick follow-up. St. Jude is
going to be accretive to 2017. But your accretion calculations, did it
contemplate the divestitures that you just announced to Terumo? Thanks.

MILES WHITE: Yes; in a fashion, Glenn, it has.

GLENN NOVARRO: Okay. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Matt Taylor, Barclays.

MATT TAYLOR, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: I wanted to focus a
little bit on the core business. We already talked about nutrition, but maybe
you could just discuss some updated thoughts on how you think the diagnostics
business at Abbott could perform over the next few periods of the Alinity
launch. And how things are going in medical devices, and some specifics on
Absorb and MitraClip and other moving parts there.

MILES WHITE: That's kind of a big question. Well, let me
start with diagnostics. I think the diagnostics business has been one of the
consistent, reliable, star performers of the Company. It's been good mid- to
higher-single-digit performing overall. It does have a fair number of moving
parts. The core laboratory business I think has performed exceptionally well;
continues to. I think the point-of-care business has. We are going through the
exit of an agreement in our molecular business that we will lap in a number of
months. But in any case, I think all of those businesses are performing
commercially well.

What I'm more impressed with, with this team, than anything
is that over the last 4 to 5 years they have had an unprecedented number of
systems, new diagnostic systems, in development in R&D that are all
beginning to launch now. And I don't think ever in the history of this industry
or this business has any company attempted to develop and launch multiple new
systems simultaneously across every category of its business. And our
diagnostics businesses, both in immuno-assay, in clinical chemistry, in
hematology, in blood screening, in point-of-care. And then to be followed in
molecular diagnostics.

And that's an unprecedented pipeline move that we will see
that roll out over years now. They are beginning to launch in Europe. We've
gotten approvals to go. So we're in an unprecedented launch phase that I think
sustains the global diagnostics business across the board for years to come.
And no other competitor is in a position to say that.

And I think that the value proposition, the performance
proposition, the economic proposition of those systems was well thought out,
well designed. They were unveiled and shown at the recent AACC meeting in the
United States, to great reception.

So, I have nothing but high and positive expectations. Now,
having said that, customers roll slowly. They tend to be long-term contractors.
They tend to be five, seven, sometimes 10 years in contracts and in tenders and
so forth, so I don't expect it to be a vertical line in terms of sales.

But I think if you think about the gradual rolling of a
customer base and taking of share as tenders come due, and so forth, I do
expect that our diagnostics business has a long positive trajectory ahead of
it, and no one else does. So I'm pretty excited about that.

I think they are in a uniquely strong position as we look
forward, and we're all pretty happy about that. It's a challenge to launch that
many systems, but we're reviewing them all closely, looking at them all
closely. And while you have all the natural hiccups at the end of a project
that you do that cost you a week here and a week there, a week in the grand
scheme of things isn't much. So I'm pretty pleased with how that's going.

With regard to medical devices, also pleased. I can start at
the top. Let me mention in medical optics, where I think the cadence of new
products and the performance of that R&D team has been exceptional, and
particularly even recently with the launch of the Symfony intraocular lenses.

And a while we have made a deal to sell that business to
J&J, we sell it in great shape with great products, great technology. They
are gaining share in the cataract and intraocular lens business. I'm really
pleased with what the team has been able to do there, and I think the business
will be in a strategically great home at J&J.

We think we got fair value for the business, and we're
working on the integration transition of that to J&J. But I think they've
been innovative. They've had a great cadence of new product development over
time. I realize that that's mostly to the benefit now of J&J's shareholders.
But the point is, across our businesses we're seeing productivity out of our
R&D and new product development like we've never seen before.

If I moved to diabetes care, our FreeStyle Libre launch in
Europe has gone well. We have over 200,000 patients now. That's a lot, and
that's a really good success rate so far. We have very ambitious plans for this
product. And to be honest, we're behind our plans by a month or two, but it's
fairly vertical ramp. It's a pretty high ramp. And that ramp is occurring at
the trajectory we projected, but about a month or two behind what we projected.
And it will probably stay that way. So, we're going to have a terrific
performance, as you can already see in the numbers, for this year. And even
that was behind what we had hoped.

But it's not because it's not on that trajectory. It just
started slower than we had planned, but now it's pretty on track. And we are
anxious to launch the consumer version in the United States and enjoy the same
sort of success here.

I think it owes to that capability of the product, the
unique medical proposition of the product, and frankly the economic proposition
of the product. A lot of payers and a lot of governments will tell you today,
don't bring me new technology; bring me something more cost-effective that
impacts my ability to spread my budget further and treat patients better. Well,
Libre has got that in the equation in a big way. So, we're looking forward to
the launch of that.

Our medical device business will certainly be enhanced by
the addition of St. Jude. But at the same time, I think there's a lot of good
things happening in our vascular business. MitraClip is going well. Supera is
going well. We continue to do well in our stent business in what is otherwise
not a growth business. We still remain the world leader in that category, and
Absorb has been licensed and launched in the United States.

So, I think across the board in diagnostics and devices,
without exception, even including AMO, all these businesses have shown, in the last
few years, real progress, real progress. Tangible progress in R&D, in
innovation, in development, and meeting their timelines in a disciplined
fashion, bringing new products to market.

And we're seeing all that roll out now and over the next
couple of years. And frankly, I think it will be sustained after that. Now,
having said that, I expect the same out of our St. Jude piece, and I think
there's nothing but good there. So we are pretty bullish about.

MATT TAYLOR: Great. Thanks for all the thoughts.

OPERATOR: Rick Wise, Stifel Nicolaus.

RICK WISE, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS & COMPANY: Miles,
maybe the first question just on Alere. Obviously there's been a lot of public
noise, if you will, a lot of headlines, a lot of discussion. But I think when
people ask me about it, they just want to be reassured that the long-term,
post-merger opportunity that you saw initially is still there. Is that the way
-- do you still see it as basically intact, and the plug-and-play for the
portfolio -- Abbott diagnostic portfolio -- still makes sense? Where are you
today on Alere?

MILES WHITE: Well, I'm going to be very limited in the
comments that I'm willing to make about Alere, but some of that is easy to
answer. So, first of all, yes, there's been a lot of noise, and it has come
from a lot of places. Not us. And it isn't prudent for us to respond to noise.

I think the questions you asked are the right questions. Is
the strategic fit there? Yes, it is. We like the products. We like the
businesses. We've said that, and I continue to say that. Is the long-term,
post-merger opportunity and fit there? Yes, it is. And I've never wavered on
that. And I believe that right now, even this minute.

So, none of that has changed for me or for us. I believe --
I just told you how great I think our diagnostics business is doing. Do I think
that the Alere businesses are a good fit to expand that footprint, and
especially our point-of-care business? I do. Yes; I have had no change in my
view strategically that way at all.

RICK WISE: Okay. So, turning to a different topic, back to
China briefly and nutritionals. Am I right in thinking -- a couple of parts to
the question. Am I right in thinking that China pediatrics is 3% or less of
sales? Does it get worse in 2017 from here? Or are you where you are, and, yes,
it will take a year or so to work through?

And maybe two last aspects of the question. Knowing you and
the way your hands-on approach to management, maybe -- are there are things
that you can do to maybe mitigate some of the near-term challenges? And maybe
last, related to all this, is the long-term outlook and how confident are you
that the excellent performance in Latin America and Southeast Asia is a
sustainable offset in this next few quarters as we get ready for 2018 in China?
Thanks, Miles.

MILES WHITE: Are we talking just nutrition there, Rick?

RICK WISE: Yes, yes. Thank you.

MILES WHITE: Okay. Okay, there's a lot there. Yes. China I
think is about 3% of overall sales. Now, that said, yes, it's a small part of
the Company as a whole. Nevertheless, it's an important business; it's a big
business; it's a business we pay a lot of attention to. Frankly, China is an
important country for us for a lot of our businesses. But it is true that in
the grand scheme of Abbott, as China pediatric goes, the Company isn't
necessarily going to be driven by just that.

So, we think all of our businesses -- particularly large
ones, and that's a large one -- are important. But the diversity of the Company
and the size of the Company obviously absorb shock when it happens in other
parts of the Company.

So, to your question about, are we hands-on mitigating and
dealing with what we think we can do with the challenges? Yes, we are. The EVP
of that business is spending a lot of time in China. We have made some management
and leadership changes in China in a proactive way to enhance our management,
our experience, our knowledge, our skill, et cetera there.

I think hope always springs eternal when you make changes in
your leadership team, et cetera. But it's getting a lot of focused attention by
the senior leadership team, on down. And in the right ways; the CFO, the
Controller, everybody who's got any kind of way to have a stake in this has
weighed in. We do, as a team, look at our spending allocations, our capital
allocations, how we're spending, where we're spending, where the bang for the
buck is, et cetera.

So I think we've looked at just about everything we can, not
only to specifically focus on improving the situation and the performance in
China, but also how to mitigate it if it doesn't improve enough or fast enough.
And so, yes, it's getting a fair amount of attention that way across the
Company.

With regard to Latin America and Southeast Asia, I'm pleased
with the progress in both places. Pleased with the performance of the business;
frankly, pleased with the performance of the business in Europe and other
places, too. But I'm going to be careful not to project what I think can happen
in any given country, because the year always starts with a certain set of
expectations and then has some surprise you didn't anticipate. Which is one of
the reasons I always tout the diverse model, because somewhere something is
going to go awry or different from your expectations, no matter how tightly you
manage everything.

In our case, I'm pleased with our management teams in the
various geographies you mentioned. I think they are all doing well. We've got a
lot of talent in the organization. We've made some changes where we needed to.
In this particular case, our challenge in China wasn't challenged-based as much
as a market-driven, and a lot of dynamics that changed rapidly there that we've
had to react to, and deal with.

So, I think there are a number of other countries picking up
slack here, the US, surprisingly, one of them in the nutrition business. I
think you can see that in the numbers in the earnings report. Vietnam doing
well, strong for us. A lot of other, smaller countries doing well.

Vietnam, as you know, is a big business for us in the
nutrition business. And we've got a terrific manager there and have had for a
long time, and that's doing well. So there are some places that are picking up
some of the slack there. And frankly, so are other businesses of Abbott, like
the pharmaceutical business and so forth; having a great year in China and
other countries, and good, sustained, high-growth performance. So, again, yes.
It's proactive. We are mitigating. It's why we're not giving any guidance or
anything at this point.

As I answered to Mike Weinstein earlier, the underlying
fundamentals of the overall growth rates in our market are good. But one place
that sticks out right now as a challenge is the pediatric business in China,
which is about 3% of the Company's sales.

RICK WISE: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.

LARRY BIEGELSEN, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES: Just two
for me. First, Miles, I know it's a sensitive subject, but on Alere, the other
question we get is now that Alere has fulfilled its reporting requirements, and
the business trends have been decent, what else does Abbott want to see before
closing the deal? And along those lines, if you don't complete Alere, how
should we think about the dilution from the AMO divestiture and offsetting that
in 2017? I did have one follow-up. Thanks.

MILES WHITE: Well, first of all, Alere is not a sensitive
subject. And at this point, I'm just not going to make a lot of comments about
it. I'd say we are pursuing all the necessary regulatory approvals for the
deal. And at this point, that is the path. That is the things that have to
happen between now and whether a deal finishes here, is regulatory approval.
So, all necessary approvals are being pursued.

We're doing everything we're supposed to do on the contract.
And beyond that I'm not going to forecast it or try to. But that's it. I can't
say a lot more about Alere, or express opinions or whatever. I think I've said
about what I can say, to Rick Wise's question and to yours. And other than
that, we'll work through the regulatory approvals and see what happens.

With regard to AMO, we've said the perceived dilution of
that business will be offset in some fashion, so you don't need to adjust your
model, et cetera. I assume that's the basis of the question. Because, net of
all considerations here, in the mix of our financing of these deals, there is
enough moving parts that we won't need to absorb dilution there.

LARRY BIEGELSEN: That's very helpful. And then you talked
about focusing on cardiovascular devices earlier. And your diabetes business is
doing well, seems to have a bright future with Libre. I guess my question is,
is diabetes still strategic for Abbott, now that the focus is more on
cardiovascular devices? Thanks for taking the question.

MILES WHITE: Yes, diabetes is definitely strategic for
Abbott. There have been a number of occasions over the past -- gosh, I think
five years -- when I've had inbound phone calls of people interested in
acquiring the diabetes care business, and we have absolutely said no. Because
we had a program here that started with Navigator years ago, that became Libre,
that fundamentally changes diabetic monitoring, glucose monitoring, et cetera,
that we believe is game changing, market changing, healthcare changing, et
cetera.

And we believe that the notion and the opportunity was such
that we just plain had a different game plan than everybody else, and that it
was worth us making that core and pursuing it; and we have. And we're seeing
the benefit of that now with the rollout of Libre in Europe and assumed rollout
in the United States. And there's a lot of opportunity for Libre beyond that,
depending on how we develop it and how we take it.

So, it is strategically core to us. If you think that's on
my radar screen for some strategic move, take it off your screen. That's core
to Abbott and will remain core to Abbott. And the opportunity there, we think,
is nothing but great looking forward.

LARRY BIEGELSEN: Very clear. Thanks for taking the
questions.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Operator, we'll take one more question.

OPERATOR: Jayson Bedford, Raymond James.

JAYSON BEDFORD, ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES,
INC.: Maybe just to actually follow up on the diabetes, clearly it was a
standout in the quarter. It was a noticeable step-up from trend, and the
guidance implies a follow-through in the fourth quarter. You have a unique
offering with Libre. Is double-digit growth how you expect this franchise to
play out over the next couple years?

MILES WHITE: Well, there's a -- you've got two franchises
going here. You've got the old, established, legacy franchise of blood glucose
monitoring. And then you've got what we call flash glucose monitoring, or
Libre. And that older blood glucose monitoring market is clearly under both
volume and price pressure. And Libre is growing rapidly in Europe, and we expect
to grow rapidly in the United States. So, at some point we would hope that
Libre would grow so significantly that it would overtake the other.

So I don't expect, obviously, that kind of growth out of the
base. But I think we're going to keep experiencing pretty heavy double-digit
growth out of Libre for the foreseeable future. So, yes, I think it drives a
lot of growth. But where it crosses and, say, the overall business is somehow
double-digit, I'm not sure I can project.

JAYSON BEDFORD: Okay, that's fair. And then just second
question on gross margin. It's down year-over-year. My understanding is that FX
has weighed on this metric. Is there a point where we anniversary the FX
headwinds and are able to see some gross margin expansion in the base business,
meaning excluding St. Jude and Alere?

MILES WHITE: Well, I'll tell you, it's interesting. We put
out fair amount of focus on gross margin -- oh, gosh, more than 4 or 5 years
ago -- in a couple of our businesses. And you can see that. You can see it in the
performance. You can see it in the bottom line of those businesses. You can see
it in the bottom line of the Company. You can see it in the gross margin of the
Company. So we expanded those efforts across the Company in a number of places.

And I think what we've obviously learned from that is
there's always opportunity to improve your business model, improve your cost
structure, improve your gross margin, et cetera. And it hasn't been done with
price. It's been done with the fundamental inputs in costs and the way we do
business, the way we manage [actual], the way we do a lot of things. So, I
think there's always opportunity. And we approach the business, and the
businesses, every year with that in mind.

And it's fortunate that we have, because we've had some
great success there in a couple businesses particularly, which has offset the
effects of exchange over the last, say, three, four years which, as you know,
has been pretty heavy. And without that, the Company would have obviously been
under a lot more profit growth pressure. So, for us, it's become a routine. We
look for more gross margin improvement opportunity every year.

And if I look across the businesses, there are still many
opportunities for us as we benchmark competitors or other models, business
models we see out there, to improve the cost structure of our business in ways
that are meaningful to the corporation. Included in that is even the costs of
new things launching. The costs of our new diagnostic analyzers will be a
tremendous improvement over the cost of our current diagnostic analyzers. And
one of the ways you can affect gross margin over the long-term is designed it
into your products, and we are.

So, I think there's a lot of initiatives internally at the
Company and across businesses now that make this part of routine daily life, to
keep improving gross margin. I can't forecast to you right now how that will
impact us. But I think in a world where you are denominated in dollars, and
every year exchange tries to erode some of your top and bottom line, it becomes
a routine part of your business to always be looking at ways to improve your
margin. And we do, and we are; and we're having a fair amount of success with
that.

JAYSON BEDFORD: I appreciate the color. Thank you.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Thank you, Operator, and thank you for
all of your questions. And that concludes Abbott's conference call. A replay of

performance in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Tom, Brian and I
will take your questions.

Before we get started, some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these
forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking
statements.

Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other
factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk
Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015. Abbott undertakes no obligation to
release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of
subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that
second-quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for
sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations
only.

On today's conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial
measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filing from today which will be available on our website at Abbott.com.

Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales
growth which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. As
you recall, Abbott issued a press release on April 28, 2016 announcing the
transaction with St. Jude Medical. Please refer to that release for additional
important information about Abbott, St. Jude and related matters.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES WHITE, CHAIRMAN & CEO, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Okay,
thanks, Scott. Good morning.

Today we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 above
our guidance range. Sales increased 6.5% in the quarter led by strong
performance in Established Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Diagnostics.

As you know, earlier in the quarter we took an important
strategic step with our announcement to acquire St. Jude Medical. Abbott and
St. Jude combined will have a highly competitive medical device portfolio
including an industry-leading new product pipeline across cardiovascular,
neuromodulation, diabetes and vision care. This strategic action builds upon
the steps we've taken to achieve critical mass and leadership positions across
each of our four businesses.

In Diagnostics and Nutrition where we hold market-leading
positions today we've been investing in R&D and infrastructure in
high-growth geographies that have strengthened our global scale and
competitiveness. And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, we've taken a number
of strategic steps over the last couple of years to position our business for
long-term growth. EPD now operates entirely in emerging geographies and holds
leading positions in many of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical
markets for branded generics in the world including India, Russia and Latin
America.

All four of our businesses will now hold leading positions
in large and growing markets that are aligned with healthcare and demographic
trends, providing a strong foundation to deliver top-tier growth over the long
term.

I will now briefly review our second-quarter results. And I
will start with Diagnostics where we achieved sales growth of 6% in the
quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and
Point of Care diagnostics.

Our Diagnostics business has been a solid and continuous
outperformer in the Company and in its industry over the past several years.
There's an opportunity here to further maintain if not improve upon this growth
trajectory as we prepare to bring multiple next-generation systems to market
across every area of diagnostics where we participate. We will provide more
details on these systems and our launch plans during the second half of the
year.

In Nutrition sales grew around 4.5% in the quarter or more
than 6% excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth in the quarter was led by US
Pediatric and international Adult Nutrition. In the US above-market performance
in Pediatric Nutrition was driven by continued growth of recently launched
products including non-GMO products for infants and toddlers.

In Adult Nutrition double-digit international growth was led
by Ensure and continued expansion of the Adult Nutrition market where Abbott is
the global leader.

In Medical Devices sales growth in our Vascular business was
led by share gains in our core stent business and double-digit growth of
MitraClip, our market leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of
mitral regurgitation. Our endovascular business also contributed another
quarter of strong growth, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our
unique peripheral stent for the treatment of blockages in the leg.

And earlier this month we received FDA approval for Absorb,
the only fully dissolving vascular stent. This first of its kind product is an
important addition to our market leading drug eluting stent portfolio in the
US.

In medical optics sales growth of 5.5% was led by
double-digit growth in our cataract products business where we continue to
capture share and drive growth with our portfolio of premium cataract lens
products. Last week we further strengthened our portfolio in the US with the
FDA approval for our TECNIS Symfony lenses, the first and only lenses that
provide a full range of continuous high-quality vision following cataract
surgery.

In diabetes care international sales growth of more than 15%
was driven by continued consumer uptake of our new and innovative FreeStyle
Libre device in Europe. We continue to see strong demand as consumers and
healthcare professionals become increasingly aware of the many benefits of this
innovative device. There are now more than 125,000 patients utilizing FreeStyle
Libre in Europe and we're working to bring this novel technology to new markets
including the United States.

And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, our strategy of
targeting key geographies with a broad portfolio across select therapeutic
areas continues to deliver strong results. Sales growth of 9.5% or 14%
excluding the impact of Venezuela was led by balanced growth across several
markets including India, China and several countries in Latin America. The
acquisitions and subsequent integrations of both CFR Pharmaceuticals and
Veropharm have exceeded our expectations and are contributing to strong growth
overall.

So in summary it was a good quarter and we're particularly
pleased with the steady cadence of new product approvals and recent launches
that are contributing to growth including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip Absorb and
Symfony. And we took another important step to strengthen our strategic
position and long-term growth potential with our announced acquisition of St.
Jude Medical.

I will now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our
results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?

BRIAN YOOR, SVP, FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Okay, thank you, Miles. Sales for the quarter increased 6.4% on an operational
basis. That is excluding an unfavorable impact of 3.2% from foreign exchange.

The negative impact from exchange was somewhat higher than
previous expectations due to modest strengthening of the US dollar relative to
other currencies in the quarter. Reported sales increased 3.2% in the quarter.

Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter the
adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.6% of sales, somewhat above our previous
guidance. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A
expense was 31.6% of sales, each in-line with previously issued guidance.

Turning to our outlook for the full-year 2016, our adjusted
earnings per share guidance range of $2.14 to $2.24 from continuing operations
remains unchanged and reflects double-digit underlying growth offset by the
impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We continue to forecast
operational sales growth in the mid single digits for the full year. Based on
current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around
2.5% on our full-year reported sales, somewhat higher than previous
expectations of negative 2%.

This would result in reported sales growth in the low single
digits for the full-year 2016. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin
ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year which includes underlying gross
margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted
R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of
approaching 31% of sales for the full year.

We now forecast net interest expense of around $100 million,
reflecting changes in interest rate assumptions on both our borrowing rates for
debt and the income we earn on some of our investments, and around $35 million
of non-operating expense.

Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we forecast
adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 to $0.59, again reflecting double-digit
underlying growth partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our
results. We forecast operational sales growth of mid single digits in the third
quarter. And at current exchange rates we'd expect a negative impact from
exchange of around 1.5%.

Turning to other aspects of the P&L, for the third
quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57%,
adjusted R&D investment around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense
of around 30% of sales. Finally, we project specified items of $0.19 in the
third quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in
our earnings release.

Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a
quick overview of our third-quarter and full-year operational sales growth
outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals we forecast high
single-digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year; in
Nutrition we forecast low to mid single-digit sales growth for both the third
quarter and full year; in Diagnostics we forecast mid single-digit sales growth
for both the third quarter and full year; and lastly in our Medical Devices
businesses, for Vascular we now forecast low single-digit sales growth for both
the third quarter and full year, in diabetes we forecast high single-digit
growth for the third quarter and mid single-digit sales growth for the full
year, and in medical optics we forecast low to mid single-digit for the third
quarter and mid single-digit sales growth for the full year.

With that we will now open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan.

MIKE WEINSTEIN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Good
morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.

Miles, let's start with a couple of items if we could if I'm
sure everybody would love to get an update on the two transactions in both St.
Jude and Alere. So, in particular on Alere I think people would love to hear
your comments.

And then second, fundamentally it was a good quarter. I
think the mix of growth was a little bit different than what we saw the last
couple of quarters. If there is one business that probably is worth spending a
few more minutes on it's the international Pediatric Nutritionals business.

We've seen a couple of the local companies announce weaker
results. Your quarter this quarter wasn't as good as some of your recent
quarters, so maybe you can talk about what's going on in some of those markets,
obviously in particular China. Thanks.

MILES WHITE: As usual Mike, you are spot on. You know I feel
like you must've been in the room or something here.

Let me deal with the transactions first. And I will go right
to the one that you targeted, Alere. From our perspective there's been no
change.

They still haven't filed a 10-K. Our access to information
has been limited. And they did put out a press release with an update that I
think was, at least from my perspective, overenthusiastically embraced from one
of their analysts.

But to that extent, the update they put out basically
provided no particular new information and was a requirement they had with
their bondholders for the extensions they got on the requirements in their
agreements. And the information they put out was characterized as preliminary,
unaudited, summary-only, etc.

So I think from our perspective no change other than the
passage of time. And that's about all I can say about it at this point. So I'm
not an odds predictor here, so I have no particular prediction to make other
than the information that's here and there's no more really to say about it
since the last time you asked me the question.

So moving to St. Jude, I'd say everything is tracking well.
We've got a second request from the FTC which we'll certainly respond to. I'd
say there's not much in the way of surprises there.

All of our planning going forward is going according to
plan. There's no surprises, no negatives. Their performance appears to be
tracking according to our forecast, our expectations and for their forecast.

In fact, I'd say their report this morning looks to me like
their best quarter in about the last six anyway. And they are trending in the
right directions as we predicted and forecasted and saw in our due diligence.

So I'd say with regard to St. Jude, everything is tracking
well. We still hope to close that before year-end. I think that will be a close
call just as we work our way through the administrivia of the FTC's request and
so forth and whatever we may have to do there.

But I'd say there's no big surprises at all. We're just
going to try and complete the work that we've already indicated. And everything
there is tracking according to plan.

With regard to the mix of business, I'd say you can see in
our numbers it's a strong quarter across the board, across the world in all of
our businesses but one. And the Nutrition business is weaker and the weakness
is primarily focused on China pediatric, really nowhere else. What's been not
only forecasted by some of our global competitors but also our own experience
has been a slowing of growth in the China pediatric market.

Last year at this time I think that market was probably 13%,
14% growth estimated and this year it's probably just under half that would be
our estimate. And I think that's probably consistent with what some of our
competitors have seen or expressed as well.

But we're seeing about half the growth rate as a market rate
that we've seen in the past. And that's clearly it's softening the sales growth
rate and we've seen that and we are seeing that. We have not yet seen in any
data that there's any share change that's impacting us but our growth rate is
clearly slower.

So I'm a little cautious on the second half. I don't expect
that to change on this particular business. I don't expect that growth rate or
that let's just call it softness -- it's not softness in terms of decline, it's
just slower growth.

It's still a pretty healthy growth rate compared to anywhere
else in the world and it's good growth rate. It's just not the double-digit
growth rate it was last year or the year before. And as you know, that market
has been a pretty high grower from a growth rate standpoint for quite some
time.

So that's an adjustment to for all of us to adjust to. I
don't know whether that's a long-term change in the market. I know that there's
an increasing breastfeeding rate in China.

But in terms of other fundamentals we see channel shifts and
so forth. But channel shifts shouldn't impact the overall market over time
here. So other than the dynamics of just lower growth or slowing demand I'd say
that's about the best way I can characterize it.

As I said, the market growth at 6% is still a healthy rate.
It's just not the one that we've been used to and enjoyed for the past several
years.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Maybe I could just get in two quick
follow-ups. So one on the Alere question, can you just talk about some of the items
that you're still waiting on beyond just the filing of the 10-K?

And then second, Brian, you raised your estimated FX impact
on the top line for the Company. I assume there is an incremental FX headwind
on the bottom line and that's in part why you're not raising 2016 guidance. But
if you could shed any light on that, that would be great.

MILES WHITE: With regard to I guess Alere, some information
has been provided to us. We've made a number of requests regarding books and
records and things that we want to audit and have access to. Some of that's
been provided to us and a fair amount of it has not and continues not to be.

So there's really nothing more I can say at this point,
Mike, unfortunately. The announcement that they put out was not that forthcoming
and I certainly wouldn't share the optimism that one of their analysts
expressed about their announcement. But I think we're just in a waiting
situation here.

With regard to guidance, I mean I'll just preempt Brian a
little bit here. You will recall we did raise guidance after the first quarter.
And I think I want to be careful how I state this because all of our businesses
are running really strong here but I am a little cautious on the second half.

Part of it is FX but part of it is just watching underlying
market growth, particularly keeping an eye on China. That doesn't mean I'm
negative on China at all. I'm not.

But I think it's premature to forecast raising guidance on
the second half of the year. So I think we will just keep our powder dry there.

BRIAN YOOR: Mike, around $0.01 to $0.02 on the back half.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Perfect. Thank you, guys. I appreciate you
taking the questions.

OPERATOR: Matt Taylor, Barclays.

MATT TAYLOR, ANALYST, BARCLAYS: Good morning, thanks for
taking the questions. I wanted to start with Medical Devices.

Your results there even excluding the royalty were better
than recent trends and you called out some new products. I was wondering if you
could give us some more details on the contributions of those and what you
expect out of Absorb or any other meaningful products going forward.

MILES WHITE: I will give you a little bit of overview and
then I will ask Brian for a little help on some of the details here. But the
Vascular business is doing better. And a couple of things there.

MitraClip is certainly a contributor to that and so also is
the endovascular business. On the core stent business, and there is still
pricing pressure there because it's an intensely competitive market among three
of us, but at the same time we're gaining share. And I think that business if I
would characterize it is doing better and stronger than it has been in the
last, call it, year and a half.

So I'm pretty pleased with the progress there and the
performance of the team. The royalty situation itself, there is a catch-up in
there which inflates the number, the growth number for this quarter because
it's catch-up of the past. But it's also we are going to have that royalty
going forward here so that will be something we will clearly have in the future
which has not been there for the past few quarters.

So that's a plus. But if you take out the impact of that
catch-up in the royalty, the growth in the Vascular business in the quarter is
better than we've seen in quite some time. Brian, do you want to add any detail
to that?

BRIAN YOOR: Yes, Matt, we are growing mid single digits even
but for the royalty here. MitraClip had a really strong quarter. We're seeing
great adoption uptake and utilization in the centers we're in there.

And our endovascular business continues to perform well.
It's growing double digits, the combination of both Supera for the SFA, as you
know, as well as our vessel closure business.

And as far as the other side of like medical optics, you
continue to see us grow, outpacing the market in cataracts, particularly with
our premium lenses and just excited about the cadence of portfolio that's
coming here, particularly with Symfony to continue to build upon that. And
then, of course, you know the story on FreeStyle Libre.

MILES WHITE: The optics market, particularly in the US, as
you know, has experienced a fair amount of price decline in the Lasix business.
And setting that aside, the performance in the cataract and intraocular lens
business has just been stellar. And we're really pleased with that.

We're pleased with our R&D group for the products that
they put out, pleased with the reception by customers. And to be growing in
healthy double digits in that segment, well, it's great fun. All of these
businesses have had their times when they've been down or waiting for new
products but these businesses are all doing really well.

MATT TAYLOR: Great. And I just want to follow up on
Diagnostics. You've talked for a while about the potential for a refresh of the
Core Lab and Molecular systems. It was wondering if you could give us a little
bit more thoughts on timing, the feature upgrades and what really matters there
and how that can contribute to growth for DF.

MILES WHITE: We've got a number of new systems coming here,
all of which have been under development for a few years in our Diagnostics
business. And we're starting to see those roll out now and we will see over the
next let's say two, three years.

First of all, we just launched AlinIQ which is an
informatics program that is designed to help labs with productivity and their
own cost management and so forth, which we think is going to be exceptionally
well received. That's launched.

Following that we've got five systems coming. There is a
next-generation system in our Point of Care business that will begin to launch
in Europe in the second half of this year, probably in the fourth quarter then
in the US in 2017.

Then the Core Lab systems for both immunoassays and clinical
chemistry testing will begin to roll out, as well. We expect European launch
before the end of the year and the US in 2018, early in 2018.

Blood screening, same thing, late in the year in Europe,
late this year in Europe, a brand-new system. Beyond that hematology the
following year 2017, early 2017 in Europe. And then all of these early on in
2018 in the US.

And then finally in our Molecular business in the second
half of 2017 we begin to roll out a new system in Europe. So that's a lot and
that's unprecedented. No Company in our business has ever put that many new
systems out.

Not just refreshments, they are not just software updates or
upgrades or incremental improvements on existing systems. They are all complete
new refresh systems or redone and with some new advantages and so forth. So
we're pretty excited about the entire product line.

Diagnostics has been doing really well with the mature
products in its line. And when you think about the complete line of new
products coming over the next couple of years to that business I think that's
just really a great shot in the arm there for a business that's been
outperforming as it is anyway.

Customers will start to see those systems at the AACC
Conference in Philadelphia later this month. In a number of the industry trade
shows in the US and Europe we will clearly be introducing those systems to
customers so they get a preview in advance. So I think the future for
Diagnostics looks pretty good.

MATT TAYLOR: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Rick Wise, Stifel.

RICK WISE, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Good morning, Miles,
good morning everybody. Miles, just to start with sort of a bigger picture
question, a lot of the pushback that I get in talking about the acquisitions,
that St. Jude, Alere, seems to revolve around a few points that both are
challenged, even troubled assets, that you're taking on too much integration
challenge at once, the uncertainty around an equity raise, the lack of
certainty around how Abbott will add value, improve, or better run particularly
St. Jude and maybe a little lack of clarity about the Abbott senior management team,
how that's going to change, who's going to lead the effort, again particularly
on the device side.

While I personally don't agree with these thoughts, I'd be
curious just looking at the big picture here, again, given your long track
record of successful opportunistic M&A, how is St. Jude, Alere set up
better or worse than some of the past challenges you've faced? Why are these
the right deal after another few months of thinking about it? What needs to be
done to ensure that these are the right moves today for Abbott shareholders?

MILES WHITE: Well I'd say a couple of things. And I
understand the sentiments of investors in general. I think that, first of all
I'd say it's not a skeptical or cautious attitude on the part of investors with
just about everything, not particular to Abbott or specific to Abbott but I
think there's just a lot of caution out there.

All that frothy, robust enthusiasm of a year and half ago is
definitely not there now. And yet the market is at a near high, but in our
business that, businesses, that enthusiasm or at least that attitude doesn't
seem to be that lit up. So we put this in the context of all of that.

I think what I find in the feedback from investors is they
just want a lot more clarity and a lot more visibility so that they can
forecast or model or know where all this is going to go. Because I can put a
historic -- I can lean on historical track record and say hey, look, AMO wasn't
a great performing business when we bought it but right now it is doing
exceptionally well.

The assets we assembled as EPD were not at the time great
assets. I'd say CFR was a pretty great asset, but a lot of the assets that we
put together weren't necessarily super performing assets. And right now I'd say
we've got one of the gems in the branded generic business globally because of
the markets and the things we're in.

And I think the track record of how we integrate or how we
manage our businesses is proven. We're not intimidated at all by the
integration. Frankly, that part I think we've shown we're really good at.

We've got an experienced team in place. I'm not worried
about that at all. And, frankly, in the case of St. Jude the organizations are
so well aligned I think that one will go extremely well and extremely smoothly.

I don't consider St. Jude to be a particularly challenged
organization. I think that they've got a great pipeline of products. I think
they've got a lot of good products.

They went through a fairly significant organizational
structural change over the last two years that I think proved to be somewhat
disruptive to the operation of the organization. We are well aware of that. We
are well aware of what it meant, how it works, etc.

But understanding that, I think we've got a pretty good idea
of how to integrate St. Jude and run it going forward. With regard to the
management team, the management team that will be running our device businesses
will be a mix, probably a fairly balanced mix of Abbott and St. Jude people.
Where we believe that there's clear benefit to Abbott management, talent, etc.,
or experience that we can bring to the party we certainly intend to do so.

And we've pretty well aligned out what we think that is. And
we will also have the benefit of some of the most experienced and best managers
and so forth at St. Jude.

I think St. Jude has been probably more maligned in the last
year than it's deserved because they missed earnings in the third and fourth
quarter and they've had some delays in product approvals. But to be honest, if
they had an MRI compatible CRM product I don't think we'd be hearing nearly as
much criticism of St. Jude. And it's amazing how one thing or maybe if they
were achieving the reimbursement of CardioMEMS faster, that's about it.

Beyond that their businesses are booming. All their other
businesses are doing super well and they've already shown that they can recover
share when they get a CRM approval by their performance in Japan. So I think
it's been overblown, Rick.

And I understand when investors are disappointed it takes
them a while to recover from that and then they are skeptical. And then they
look at Abbott and say, well, why do you think you can do it better? And my
answer to that is I think we can do it better and I think St. Jude can do it
better and so does St. Jude.

And I think that the two of us together both believe that,
first of all, they resolve their MRI compatibility issue and continue to run
the business well, which they are. This business is going to do not only how
analysts expect and we expect, which is growth of 4.5%, 5% or more, but frankly
maybe even better than that.

As I've indicated on other calls, St. Jude's own estimates
of how they are going to do are even higher than that. Our deal was done based
on estimating, frankly, same kind of growth rates analysts estimate which put
them at call it 4.5% to 5% going forward. And right now they are tracking
towards that with their performance in all their businesses.

We're just waiting for an approval of an MRI compatible CRM
and I think this changes. As I look forward I think the breadth of the business
and the combination with Abbott and the improved performance in our own
Vascular business is nothing but up.

While right now you've got this period where there is
uncertainty, uncertainty about when will it close and you haven't forecasted
what it will do and so forth I think a lot of our investors are just more
cautious. But I look at it and we look down the road at our own projections and
what we believe we're going to do and I think okay, the stock is whatever it is
today, $42 or whatever, I don't think investors are ever going to see another
point to buy-in at this level.

That's what I think, I actually believe that. And I think
our track record has proven we know how to integrate it, we know how to manage
it, we know how to do well with it. We know how to add value to it.

We know what the breadth of offering is. We know the quality
of their pipeline and the quality of their people. You don't just buy it for
the portfolio and leave it alone.

You buy it and you put the best management you can in place
and you run it the best you can. We've got really excellent management in our
Medical Devices business and I think they've got excellent people, too.

So in spite of the fact that they disappointed investors I
think the investors got to get over last year and look forward here because I
don't think we bought some challenged property here.

Alere, yes, it has challenges. They acknowledge they have
got challenges, too. And, frankly, they've had challenges for a number of years
and the management team that's there right now has been there just a little
more than two years.

They have dealt well with a lot of the challenges Alere has.
Now they clearly have more, and to be honest no matter what kind of teeth
grinding and gnashing we go through with them here or they are going through,
etc., one thing I'm certain of is that they are trying to do everything they
can their way to address the challenges in the Company. I don't think
otherwise.

So whether it all works out the way originally planned or
not don't know. Can't predict. As I've said many times we like the products and
to us it's an opportunistic opportunity to expand our Diagnostics business.

Our Diagnostics business is one of the most consistent,
top-performing businesses in our country and in its industry and they've proven
they know how to manage cost. They know how to manage product, they know how to
manage the commercial operations. They know how to grow, they know how to
compete.

This business is one of our best, most reliable businesses
in the Company and to expand that footprint with more products is just an
opportunistic plus. If for some reason it didn't work out we still have one of
the top-performing companies in the industry but if we can add to it, well then
even better.

So I think to address further investors having two deals in
the hopper at the same time is a lot of moving parts for investors. It leaves
some things uncertain. It leaves the issue, as you said, the equity issuance
uncertain.

Obviously if for some reason both of these didn't happen
there wouldn't be a need or a desire to do that because we're trying to balance
our overall debt and equity balance sheet. So we'll see, we just don't know at
this point. And I think there's other ways that we can consider addressing that
issue around the equity issue.

In fact, I have had the feedback from investors that they
are concerned, at least they don't like it because it's dilutive. And I'm aware
of that but I don't think we're anywhere close to where we have to make a
decision on the equity issuance.

At this point we're planning for it but we're only going to
do it if it's in our interest to do it, balance our balance sheet. So full
transparency, we're planning to do it but there's other ways it may well be
addressed and we're nowhere close to a resolution of that.

I think that the uncertainty of that for investors just has
them cautious, concerned and so on. I think what I tell most people is look, by
January this is all going to be pretty clear and it's going to be resolved one
way or another. And we'll know whether we are going to do something like that
or not.

I think the same thing is true of we get asked a lot about
the Mylan shares and what are we going to do and are they going to play a role
and the answer is to be determined. Unclear. Right now my sense is if I don't
have to sell those shares I'm not going to.

So I think that there's enough moving parts here. I actually
like the moving parts, even though investors want real clarity I don't want to
make any of these decisions until I actually have to. And there's probably a
number of months that are going to go by before we have to.

And it's unfortunate, it leaves a little bit of uncertainty
not only for Abbott's shareholders but for Mylan's, too, to some degree. But if
we don't have a need to sell those shares I don't intend to. At least not
anytime soon, let me put it that way.

So I think those are all moving parts. I think there's some
frustration out there. I think people want to buy this stock, I think they want
to be in the stock, I think they want the ride that we think we have ahead of
us here for the coming years. They just don't know whether there's going to be
some surprise they can't anticipate.

And right now I think all the possible outcomes here are
pretty evident. And I don't see anything that's going to take us backwards, but
I certainly see a lot of things that are going to take us forward. And I'm
pretty optimistic about it.

I just think that we and investors have to ride through
about, call it, six months of less certainty on some of the choices here until
it starts to resolve. And that's not going to be next month, it's going to be a
while.

RICK WISE: That's great perspective. One tiny quick
follow-up. Obviously FreeStyle Libre is off and running in Europe.

You said you are working to bring it to the US. What's
needed to make that happen, what's the kind of timing should we expect for
FreeStyle Libre in the US? Thanks so much.

MILES WHITE: Gosh, I'm not sure how specific to be about
that. We're going to submit as soon as possible. And I would estimate it is
approved in the US, is my estimate and my guesstimate, in the first quarter.

That's what I would guess. And there's two stages to this:
there's a Libre Pro and then a Libre Consumer. So I think that our ambition
would be to get this approved probably within the next six to eight months,
something like that but we'll see.

There's a number of steps that are going to happen here in
the interim. In the meanwhile I think it's doing exceptionally well in its rollout
in Europe. We've had a really good reception from the states and countries with
regard to reimbursement, which I think is unusual.

Thus far Libre's success has been driven by consumer pay and
direct consumer pay. And we are achieving our goals of getting key countries in
key places to agree to reimburse the product which should, frankly, make a big
difference in the performance in the market. And it's already trending north at
a pretty good clip.

So I'm pretty enthusiastic about Libre. And, of course, when
you got a product that's as good as that is and trending like it is you're in a
big hurry to get it approved in the US yesterday. So that's where we are.
Brian, do you want to add anything to that or Scott?

BRIAN YOOR: No, I think that was perfectly characterized.
Thanks.

RICK WISE: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Glenn Novarro, RBC Capital Markets.

GLENN NOVARRO, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Hi, good
morning, guys. My first question relates to St. Jude. They did report this
morning, and I thought what was very important is the fact that all their new
products and timelines were reaffirmed this morning, which really set St. Jude
up to rebound and have a strong 2017.

And Miles, you mentioned St. Jude's internal forecast, we
read it in the proxy 10% revenue growth for the next five years which is well
above what the street is modeling. I'm curious --

MILES WHITE: It's above what I modeled.

GLENN NOVARRO: Okay, and it's above what I modeled. What is
in that forecast that gets them to that 10%? I guess another way to say it is
what are the upside surprises that could exist within the St. Jude outlook
portfolio over the next five years if you can maybe call some out to us?

And then putting the two companies together there could be
sales dissynergies. I think you are hoping for sales synergies. How soon do you
think you can achieve those sales synergies? Thank you.

MILES WHITE: Okay, a couple of things. First, before I phone
a friend next to me here for some of the details underlying specific products,
I would tell you that, first of all, if you've got a robust portfolio of new
products coming that's always a good thing. And we're naturally always
optimistic about the uptake of products, the penetration of products, the
introduction of products and so forth.

And it's always a constant balance of being sufficiently
enthusiastic and pushing your organization hard enough on how you want to take
those products to market. And then there's always the speed bumps. Something
slows you down somewhere whether it's reimbursement or the timing of an
approval or whatever.

And in all my years in the industry I have never seen on a
particularly consistent basis any company, including my own, deliver its new
products on time, on plan, on schedule without some kind of delay. Even with
Libre our ambitions, in terms of our own internal goals we're probably a couple
months behind where we wanted to be, months, a couple of months. And yet we
have pretty stiff goal in our own minds about what we're trying to do here.

And if you look at the product its screaming north at a
rocket-like pace, which is a good thing. And all it takes is some minister
somewhere to slow down his decision a few weeks and you're off by a couple
weeks.

So when I look forward at St. Jude and I look at the 10%, is
it potentially possible? Yes, it's potentially possible but it's a lot of green
lights, it's a lot of green lights without any speed bumps. And the reality of
life is there's a lot of speed bumps.

So I would have judged it back a little bit in terms of just
caution. I think they're aspirational about the pace at which those new
products come. I don't think there's any disagreement on our part with them
about how good the products are, how well received they'll be, what competitive
response will be and so forth.

I also think they're going to benefit from some great market
growth rate behind a lot of these products. They don't have to go tear it way
from somebody else in competition hand-to-hand combat. The CRM business is
hand-to-hand combat, but a lot of the other businesses here are, frankly, just
plain innovative, new, and relying on growth and training physicians in usage
and so forth.

So I think that while they would -- their estimates really
were sort of in that 9% and up range. I think we're just being naturally cautious
at the unknown and I think analysts are too.

When we looked across a consensus of analysts for St. Jude
the consensus was around 4.5% to 5% growth going forward here for the next five
years. And what's ironic about that is I've spoken to a lot of these analysts
because we know them covering us as well and they'll say, yes, I know that's
what my model says but I'm just not sure they are really going to do that. And
that's because their growth rate was more flat over the last five years.

But the growth rate was flat over the last five years
because they didn't have some of these products or a Thoratec or some of the
other businesses they've got now. And right now they've got a heck of a lot
more in the pipeline and a heck of a lot more that they've added to the company
since say three, four years ago.

So I don't think the last five years growth rates are
relevant as a comparison. I think what they've got and what they've done is and
I think right now the growth rate is only suppressed because they've got
difficulty with not having an MRI compatible claim on their CRM and CRT
products.

You take that away and this business is already at analyst
projections and analyst projections have been more robust than the past
history. So I think St. Jude is one of those stories where once you disappoint
some investors in a couple of quarters the investor doesn't believe the
projection of the future as much as he believes the rearview mirror. So I think
they've got to put the points on the board and earn back a little credibility
that what they've projected is actually going to happen and I think the
sentiment will change on St. Jude.

Now I'm not investing in sentiment, I'm investing in real
products and real Company and real business. And I think that what they're
tracking at right now is giving the evidence that what they projected is valid.
These businesses if you look at all the segments of businesses they are really
doing great.

The one soft spot in the Company is CRM and they do have to
get better reimbursement status for CardioMEMS. Okay, that's two things and
they are all over that and we're comfortable with how they are all over that.
And the rest of the Company is doing gangbusters.

So I think they just got to show the evidence here over
time. Rick, I've already forgotten the second half of your question.

GLENN NOVARRO: Well, it's Glenn, not Rick.

MILES WHITE: Sorry.

GLENN NOVARRO: And second -- it's all right Miles -- and
it's sales synergies. So there's the potential for dissynergies but as I look
at this deal both companies are very compatible and so there conceivably should
be sales synergies. So maybe comment on how soon that can happen.

MILES WHITE: Glenn, may I call you Bob?

GLENN NOVARRO: Yes, sure.

MILES WHITE: I apologize. It was such a windy answer, I lost
track. In any case, I think the synergies are going to be easy to get.

I think the commercial synergies and that, first of all, it
depends on the integration of your sales forces, the integration of your sales
management structures, your commercial management structures. I think it
depends on how we construct our whether it's integration or cooperation across
boundaries with multiple businesses, that will -- and how customers embrace
that, particularly in the US will determine how rapidly that goes.

Having said that, the companies have had some experience
that way for some time already because we've had a joint marketing agreement
with St. Jude for a number of years between our stent business and their CRM
business. So we're already well familiar with each other. Of course, the
dynamics change when you are part of the same Company and that's a positive, it
gets better.

So I think that the nature of the kind of commercial synergy
we would look for in the broader portfolio of products that we offer, how we
approach our accounts, how we can service our accounts, etc., I'd say that
planning is well underway, if not starting to be in practice in a number of
cases. And between Mike Rousseau, the CEO of St. Jude, and Robert Ford, our
EVP, and that organization or these two organizations I think the two of them
and their people have planned and cooperated exceptionally well going forward
here.

So I think we hit the ground running as if the two companies
have been together for a long time. I don't really foresee a lot of hiccups or
bumps here.

GLENN NOVARRO: All right. And since you called me by the
wrong name, Miles, can I squeeze in one more question?

MILES WHITE: Sure.

GLENN NOVARRO: Okay. The Mylan stake, when you do sell the
Mylan stake, the cash that you realize, will that be considered O-US trapped
cash and if so how do you handle the tax liability if you bring it back indeed
to pay for Alere or St. Jude? I remember a few years ago when Tom was CFO you
brought back cash and the liability was called out as a one-timer. Is that
something you would consider doing? Thanks.

MILES WHITE: No, I don't anticipate that.

GLENN NOVARRO: Okay, but the cash would be considered
international cash. Is that correct if you do sell the stake?

BRIAN YOOR: Glenn, I would assume we can navigate this
without the tax friction. I think we've shown a propensity across the
corporation through our buybacks and other means to access our cash in an
efficient way. And I think you can assume the same about this if, to Miles's
point, if we're in a situation where we sell the stock.

GLENN NOVARRO: Okay, thank you.

MILES WHITE: I don't think we're going to have that hiccup.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Operator, we'll take one more question.

OPERATOR: Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.

LARRY BIEGELSEN, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC: Hey
guys, thanks for taking the question. Just, Miles, on Libre a clarification
question. First-quarter 2017 is that the professional version or the consumer
version?

As far as I know you haven't disclosed yet when you're filing
the consumer version in the US. And second, on the Dexcom panel tomorrow, what
do you think the implications are for Libre? And I did have a follow-up,
thanks.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Hey, Larry, this is Scott. I will just
touch base on the professional version very quickly.

As you know, we filed for that device in the middle of last
year. We are working with the FDA on that and that is the approval we would
expect in the next six to nine months on that particular point. Obviously, as
it relates to as you know the Dexcom panel tomorrow, we're really excited about
the US market.

We think there's lots of opportunity there. We think Libre
is a unique technology. It's a discussion we will be watching closely to see
how the FDA is thinking about these novel technologies and how to apply them
for diabetic patients' needs in today's market.

LARRY BIEGELSEN: Thanks. And then lastly, we saw J&J
adopt ASU 2016-09 yesterday and had some implications for their tax rate. What
are the implications for you guys and when do you plan to adopt it? Thanks for
taking the questions.

BRIAN YOOR: So we don't need to adopt until 2017, Larry. And
we're still assessing what that means in terms of our ongoing earnings on a
year-to-year basis because there's some moving parts there. We're still
assessing -- we won't adopt until we have to.

LARRY BIEGELSEN: Thanks a lot, guys.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Thank you, operator and thank you for all
of your questions. That concludes Abbott's conference call.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good morning and thank you for standing by.
Welcome to the Abbott's first-quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

(Operator Instructions)

This call is being recorded by Abbott with the exception of
any participant's question asked during the question-and-answer session. The
entire call including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted
by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed
written permission.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice
President, of Investor Relations.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER, VP, IR, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Good morning
and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President,
Finance and Administration; and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice President, Finance and
Chief Financial Officer.

Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss
our performance in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Tom, Brian and
I will take your questions.

Before we get started some statements made today may be
forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that
these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may
cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our
forward-looking statements.

Economic, competitive, governmental technological and other
factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in item 1a, risk
factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015. Abbott undertakes no obligation to
release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of
subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that
first-quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for
sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations
only.

On today's call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures
will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the
comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory
filing from today which will be available on our website at Abbott.com. Our
commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth which excludes
the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.

With that I will now turn the call over to Miles.

MILES WHITE, CHAIRMAN & CEO, ABBOTT LABORATORIES: Okay,
thanks, Scott. Good morning.

Today we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.41
exceeding our previous guidance range. Sales increased 5% in the quarter led by
strong performance in Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals.

As you know we've been taking important strategic steps to
expand our footprint in the world's fastest-growing geographies and have been
investing in R&D that has resulted in numerous new product launches across
our businesses. These actions and investments are driving our strong
first-quarter performance which I'll briefly review by business.

I will start with Diagnostics where we achieved sales growth
of 7% in the quarter, driven by continued above market performance in core
laboratory and point of care diagnostics. We continue to capture share and win
new accounts with our customer focused solutions which we further enhanced with
an unprecedented series of new instrument launches over the next few years.

We continue to make great progress on our next-generation
diagnostic systems and point of care immunoassay testing, clinical chemistry,
hematology and blood screen. These new systems are being designed with the
customer in mind, incorporating the features they deem most important including
increased automation, higher throughput and an enhanced user interface. We will
provide more details on our launch plans of the systems in the coming quarters.

In Nutrition, both pediatric and adult nutrition grew
roughly 4.5% in the quarter. Above market performance and US pediatric
nutrition was led by strong performance of recently launched non-GMO products
for infants and toddlers. Internationally pediatric nutrition growth was led by
continued share expansion of Eleva in the premium segment of the Chinese market
as well as continued strong growth in Russia and across several countries in
Latin America.

In adult nutrition where Abbott is the global leader, sales
growth was led by Ensure in the retail and institutional segments of the US
market as well as double-digit growth in several Latin American countries as we
continued to expand the adult nutrition category globally.

In Medical Devices sales growth was led by 5.5% growth in
medical optics where we continue to capture share and drive growth in our
portfolio of recently launched premium cataract lens products. Earlier this
month we opened a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia that is capable of
producing over 4 million lenses a year to meet the growing demand for our
products.

In diabetes care international sales growth of 11% was
driven by continued consumer uptake of FreeStyle Libre in Europe. During the
quarter FreeStyle Libre received European approval for use in children and teens
who can now manage their diabetes without the need for routine finger sticks.
We expect growth in our diabetes business to accelerate in the coming quarters
as we meet increasing demand for Libre from consumers and healthcare
professionals and we also look forward to bringing Libre to new markets
including the US.

In vascular, modest growth in the quarter was led by
double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally
invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation and strong performance in our
endovascular business driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique
peripheral stent for the treatment of blockages in the superficial femoral
artery. And in established pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales growth of 11% was led
by continued double-digit growth in India which comprises more than 20% of EPD
sales including strong growth in the therapeutic areas of women's health,
gastroenterology and cardio-metabolics. We also achieved above-market growth in
China and several countries in Latin America as we continue to expand our
presence and portfolios in these important geographies.

Finally, given our performance in the first quarter, coupled
with an improving exchange outlook, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS
guidance range to $2.14 to $2.24. So in summary, we're off to a good start this
year with each of our four businesses having met or exceeded growth
expectations for the quarter and with good progress on our new product
initiatives.

So I will now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our
results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?

BRIAN YOOR, SVP, FINANCE & CFO, ABBOTT LABORATORIES:
Okay, thanks, Miles. First I'll provide further details on the first-quarter
results. Sales for the quarter increased 5.1% on an operational basis.

Exchange had an unfavorable impact of 5.3% on sales,
resulting in relatively flat reported sales in the quarter. Regarding other
aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was
56.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was nearly 7% of sales and adjusted
SG&A expense was nearly 34% of sales.

Turning to the details of our full-year 2016 outlook we
continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid single digits. Based
on current exchange rates we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of
around 2% on our full-year reported sales. This would result in reported sales
growth in the low single digits for the full-year 2016.

We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of
sales for the full year which includes underlying gross margin improvement
initiatives across our business. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of
around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for
the full year. This would result in full-year adjusted earnings per share
guidance of $2.14 to $2.24 from continuing operations.

For the second quarter, today we are issuing ongoing
earnings per share guidance of $0.52 to $0.54, reflecting double-digit
underlying growth offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating
results. We forecast operational sales growth of mid single digits in the
second quarter. At current exchange rates we'd expect a negative impact from
exchange of around 3%, resulting in reported sales in the low single digits.

I'll now provide a quick overview of our second-quarter
operational sales growth outlook by business. In Diagnostics, we forecast
mid-single-digit sales growth. In Nutrition we forecast sales to increase mid
to high single digits.

In Vascular we forecast relatively flat sales growth. In
Diabetes Care we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth. In Medical Optics we
forecast mid-single-digit sales growth and lastly in Established
Pharmaceuticals we forecast mid-single-digit sales growth in the second
quarter.

Turning back to the other aspects of the P&L, for the
second quarter we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above
57%, adjusted R&D investment somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted
SG&A expense of around 31.5% of sales. Finally, for the second quarter we
project specified items of $0.14.

And now with that we will open the call for questions.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Kristen Stewart, Deutsche
Bank.

BRITTANY HENDERSON, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Hi everybody,
it's Brittany Henderson in for Kristen Stewart. I just wanted to start on a
high-level basis.

The Medical Devices business continues to be somewhat of a
drag on the overall business. So we just wanted to get your thoughts on just
the outlook for Abbott pharmaceuticals with Medical Devices and how that kind
of fits along with the other segments of the business, how it fits in with
Nutrition and Diagnostics and the Established Pharma business?

BRIAN YOOR: Yes, this is Brian. I will start off and open it
up to miles.

I think you've got to look within Medical Devices and there
are a lot of bright spots here in terms of what's growing. If you look at
MitraClip we had 40% growth in the quarter. And that's a space we're early to
and it could be a large market here.

If you look at our Supera product, again a newly added
product in the not-too-distant past, it's grown double digits for the quarter.
And coupled with that our vessel closure business has led to real strong growth
in the endovascular.

Clearly as you see on the stent side it is a flattish market
but even then we're excited about our portfolio we have. It provides a great
contribution to our business. And if you look at where we're at now we've
stabilized our share of where we're at and we're excited about bringing Absorb into
the portfolio ultimately and to further compete in this aspect of the business.

Miles, I don't know if you'd add anything to that.

MILES WHITE: The only thing I would add is that we've got
Absorb coming in the US and Europe. We've got a number of things happening here
from a new product standpoint expansion of the business that I think are all
good for the business going forward here. So I think it's all good.

BRITTANY HENDERSON: Okay, thank you for taking the question.

OPERATOR: David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.

DAVID LEWIS, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Good morning. Miles, I
wanted to start off with Alere and just sort of reflecting on investor
commentary here in the first quarter. I think when we talk to investors I think
they understand the ability to take out margins with Alere potentially and
given the success of the Diagnostic management team in Abbott they seem to have
a high degree of confidence in your ability to do that.

Where they seem to be getting hung up is the growth
opportunity for Alere. They see Abbott as a large-cap growth Company and they
are buying a business that has below Abbott growth rates. How would you comment
on sort of how you see Alere from a top-line growth perspective over time both
market and the particular Company?

MILES WHITE: I look more at the Diagnostics business broadly
in all phases, all segments and I look at it globally and I look at it by
testing categories, not just point of care or core lab or blood screening or
molecular testing and so forth. I think our Diagnostics business has shown that
there's good growth to be had and good growth if you're innovative and your
systems and your products are responsive to customer needs.

I think all the segments of Diagnostics provide a growth
opportunity. And I think that our own business in particular has shown that not
only is there growth opportunity everywhere it competes but it can manage
margin, it can manage cost, it can manage product innovation, it can do all
that. So I would comment on the overall Diagnostics growth opportunity as
demonstrated by Abbott's Diagnostics business and not specific to any one
company.

DAVID LEWIS: Okay, and then, Brian, just a clarification.
I'm trying to kind of reconcile organic growth in the quarter, so we're
basically taking 5% operational plus like 2 points of Venezuela and getting
something around 7%. Is that kind of in the ballpark?

BRIAN YOOR: It's in the ballpark. You're right there.

MILES WHITE: You may have noted a lot of these businesses
globally in different geographic segments were growing 10%, 11% on the top line
in the quarter. So it was a pretty strong quarter across the board there,
David.

DAVID LEWIS: Yes, agreed. Thanks so much for the
clarification.

OPERATOR: Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan.

MIKE WEINSTEIN, ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: Thanks.
Miles, just to clarify, on Alere are you reaffirming your commitment to the
transaction?

MILES WHITE: I'm going to be careful how I answer any
questions about Alere, Mike, because as you know they've had delays filing
their 10-K. We don't know when they will file their proxy.

We don't know when they are going to have a shareholder
vote. So right now I'd say it's not appropriate for me to comment on Alere.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Okay, and let me ask, I've gotten a bunch of
questions already this morning just on the guidance raise relative to the FX
delta from the 4Q call to today. Depending on people's math, anybody who has
gotten anywhere from $0.06 to $0.12 of basically earnings delta from the impact
of FX from when currency was on the fourth-quarter call to where it is today,
but you only raised guidance by $0.04 including the beat today. So could you
just walk through your math, Brian, on FX and the headwind for 2016 today
versus what it was three months ago?

MILES WHITE: Before I turn that over to Brian, Mike, let me
tell you a couple of things as background. First of all, you know that the
exchange impact for us lags on the bottom line relative to the top line because
it's got a pass-through inventory, etc. So we do have that lag.

And that's always a little difficult for us to precisely
call. And we get very close but it's always a little difficult to precisely
call depending on the currency of the world and depending on inventories and so
forth in sales and sales mix in that given geography. And as you know because
we've got such a broad market basket of currencies, that's a little more
difficult to call precisely and it does lag as you've already acknowledged.

So while I'd say, look, I like what I'm starting to see as
the easing in exchange but given the last few years I'm a superstitious person
and I think the minute I think this is starting to go well for some reason
we're going to get smacked down with some change in the market. For the last
two years in the third and fourth quarter we've seen some events, some economic
event of some kind alter the world's view of economies and then a change in
exchange and more recently last fall it was $30 oil.

So if there's some caution in the raise, and I'd say if
things don't -- if we get no curveballs you're probably right. You call it the
curveball discount there. I'm just waiting to see another quarter, and right
now I'd say all indicators are looking favorable for improvement as the year
goes on.

I actually want to see some of that improvement sustain,
meaning economic conditions and exchange. Plus I'm mindful of the fact that we
made adjustments to our estimates here in the fourth-quarter call three months
ago that clearly some of that has changed with exchange but it can change in as
little as a quarter.

So with the current circumstances of the world and what
everybody is talking about in terms of real negative interest rates and so
forth that actually favors weakness of the dollar for us right now. And I hope
that continues for some time here but I just want to see some of it before I go
further.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Brian, did you want to add to that?

MILES WHITE: Brian, do you want to weigh-in on that?

BRIAN YOOR: No, I think it's perfectly articulated. Q1 and
Q2 as we talked before, Mike, is largely locked into the dynamics Miles
discussed on the timing of flow-through. So really this is a second-half
phenomenon.

MILES WHITE: Mike, if you look at it this way, the sales
strength on the top line is frankly my leading indicator here of we're above
all of your estimates. Frankly, we're above our own for the first quarter.
That's a good thing going into the year and it's across all businesses and most
geographies.

So that to me is a pretty strong indicator and if exchange
does improve arithmetically as you describe of course that only gets better,
too. So whether we forecast it now or actually experience it later we'll see.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Okay, one follow-up, Miles, and I will jump.
Can you talk about pricing across you are Nutritionals business?

And I'm asking because in the 10-K usually you guys disclose
the contribution of price to each of your different businesses. And in
Nutritionals if we went back a couple of years price is a pretty significant
contributor and I think back in 2012 it was a 4.5% contributor to the top-line
growth of the business. In 2013 it was 3.2%, in 2014 it was basically 1% and
last year it was zero.

So the contribution from price has obviously eroded over
time. And we hear the Mead Johnson calls, we hear the Danone calls talking
about pricing pressure in China and other markets. So can you just talk about
that business in that end market? And obviously we're talking about a bunch of
different end markets, but can you talk about those end markets and what's
happening with price and your view on them?

MILES WHITE: Yes, I think it's different by geography. First
of all, I think all your facts and all the stuff you just quoted, absolutely
right. Actually there's a couple of things there.

One, you know that in the last call it two years certain countries,
China, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, have taken unilateral government actions to pound
down price of the multinationals in particular in those countries in reaction
to price increases taken by multinational competitors in those countries over
the prior few years. And you know our ability to be commercially successful
around the world depends on healthy, happy markets and happy governments in
some cases. So I'd say to the extent that influences the degree to which
companies are able to take price I think that has some influence.

I also think that there's the overall balance of consumer
demand, consumer absorption, etc. And what I've been pushing with our team is
let's compete on product and volume and share gain. The prices in the market
for now they are healthy and to be truly competitively healthy I think we have
to be able to win share, win the shelf space, win the consumer, win the
physician, win the recommendation, etc.

That's where we put a lot of our emphasis. So to the extent
we have not put further emphasis on price in the last couple of years it's
primarily to sharpen our own competitiveness and compete I'd say at a pretty
effective level on all other dimensions. I think from a business fundamentals
standpoint that's important.

I want real growth, not just masked growth because we took
price, but I think at the same time the opportunity for us here is pretty good.
These are healthy products. This is a robust segment of business in all these
countries.

Profit is not challenged. And I think we're just drawing,
call it, a little different balance in terms of how we want to be competitive
versus relying on price alone or too significantly in the mix.

So I'd say have the dynamics intimidated price? I'd say
dynamics have pushed price to a more appropriately balanced level. And in our
case I want the emphasis on real share gain and product growth and market
segment growth.

And to the extent that at some point there is opportunity
for price we certainly know that. But I think price is easy and sometimes too easy.

MIKE WEINSTEIN: Thank you, Miles. I appreciate it.

OPERATOR: Bob Hopkins, Bank of America.

BOB HOPKINS, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Hi, thanks and
good morning. Thanks for taking the call. So two questions.

First one I wanted to ask on just capital allocation, Miles,
is M&A still a top priority for you from a capital allocation perspective?
And then within the different divisions is it safe to say that Vascular remains
a very high priority given the growth rate relative to your other divisions?

MILES WHITE: Yes to both. No change. Same top priority, same
focus.

The only thing I'm cautious about, Bob, that I'd say is
different, while I think there are opportunities as I've said before in the
pharmaceutical arena, and remember we're only in the branded generic
pharmaceutical business in emerging markets, we're not in the US or Europe in
pharmaceuticals, but in those markets I have noted from time to time a lot of
opportunities to add to our platform. We have in that business really strong
positions in the markets we've focused on and great depth and breadth and I
think we've chosen our countries well.

I think we've chosen our breadth and depth well. So we've
got an EPD that now post-shaping of the Europe business and so forth is a
pretty good gem. And there are other properties out there that would expand
that footprint and add to it.

However, in the last couple of years in particular, currency
or exchange in those markets has been pretty heavy headwind. And the
expectations of value by potential properties or assets in those markets has
been 25 to 30 times EBITDA which to be honest is way out there according to any
kind of historic norms. So if you have to go pay that kind of a multiple and
then translate back to dollars with a strong currency headwind you really can
earn the return for your shareholders against that headwind that you need to if
you're going to pay that kind of the multiple.

So we have sidelined that to a degree. I think we can be
selective about given markets. But we've sidelined that while we put our
emphasis and focus on other areas of Abbott's business in terms of what we're
looking at or what we're interested in.

It doesn't mean that we don't think there's wonderful
properties in the pharma business. But we're much more selective about geography,
what we think we can see as currency headwind, growth of market, etc., going
forward here because I think we want to be prudent that we earn the return. To
a high degree we're always talking about the underlying growth of the business.

Investors have got to be able to spend the underlying growth
and we've got to be able to bring that underlying growth to the real bottom
line. So while we do navigate a market basket of currencies in a volatile world
economically and we're diverse across all countries and we're in emerging
markets for their growth, I think we have to be prudent about when we invest
and how we invest in those markets that we can bring back the return that it
costs us to invest in those markets.

So we've kind of put that one I'd say partly on the back
burner but it depends on the country. And then as you say it's a high priority
for us and we continue to look at opportunities in devices and in diagnostics
and those remain of interest to us. But I know that's a long-winded answer but that's
really how we're thinking about it.

BOB HOPKINS: No, that's helpful. And in the second thing I
wanted to ask you, Miles, is that can you give us a sense of what emerging
market revenue growth was in the quarter?

And then more importantly, can you just comment broadly on
what you're seeing in terms of emerging market economies and the health of the
consumer in emerging market relative to what you saw exiting 2015? Are things
improving, stable, how would you characterize it?

MILES WHITE: I'd characterize it first of all as high single
digit overall and which I think is good. I think it kind of depends.

The world wrings its hands about slowing growth rates in
China and China was 6.5% and I think if any other country in the world was
growing 6.5% we'd all be doing cartwheels and investing heavily. We wring our
hands when a country as large as China slows to 6.5%. Even if China were at 5%
I'd think it was pretty attractive.

So I'd say I think the growth rates relatively speaking are
strong. I think you have to take into account here that historically if one
area of the world was struggling other areas of the world were pretty strong.
That's actually not the case right now.

Everything has slowed some and for all the reasons we know.
I think there's a lot of uncertainties around the world right now. And I could
run through them, but we'd just be in a bad mood afterwards.

And I think everybody is kind of waiting to see how some
things turn out. And whether exchange stays on a certain track, whether some
countries kind of recovery, I think people are waiting to see what happens with
oil and they are going to wait a while to see that. They are going to see what
happens with interest rates.

There's a lot of handwringing as I said over negative
interest rates. So there's going to be a lot of things that kind of hang on the
world. You say, well, how does that directly affect your business?

Well, in healthcare a lot of healthcare is funded by
governments and they are the insurer of their populations and so forth and the
health of their economies. And as you know almost half our business is consumer
direct in a fashion or consumer pay. So the health of those economies matters.

I still believe and continue to believe China, India,
Russia, these are all strong markets notwithstanding the currency speed bumps
that we've had here in the last couple of years. But these are strong markets,
I think there is solid growth there.

Countries like Venezuela, Brazil and some others are
obviously of great concern for their own economic circumstances and volatility.
I think Venezuela as we've talked about plenty here has been a real outlier
that way. But I think the emerging markets represent real strong growth.

I don't see that slowing. I think the kind of growth rate we
see there drives pretty healthy expansion and investment by companies like us
and Europeans and others as well. I think all those markets represent terrific
growth, better than developed markets.

But I also think if you're innovative and you have new
products and you have products that bring value to the healthcare system I
think the US and Europe are also worthy markets for us and remain a focus.
These are some of our most important markets.

So because we're geographically diverse and we are a
multinational I think they are all pretty healthy. And I think that's reflected
right now in our top line, which is pretty strong relative to all the concerns
that get expressed about the world's economies and economic growth. One of the
best things about healthcare is even in poor economic times people need
healthcare at one level or another.

So I'm pretty bullish about the opportunities for us. I
think we've all adjusted industry-wide or even investor-wide to lower growth
rates. And today we talk about 5% like it's a pretty high growth rate, and I
have to say it feels pretty good and 11% feels really good on the top line and
those kinds of things.

And I can remember when that didn't feel so good because we
were used to much higher growth rates. But, frankly, in this global economy
right now, those are pretty healthy returns and we're conscious of the returns.
So I'm still pretty positive about all this.

BOB HOPKINS: Great, thanks for the color.

OPERATOR: David Roman, Goldman Sachs.

DAVID ROMAN, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thank you, good morning
everybody. I wanted to start on the operating margin side of the business. And
this goes back a little bit to the disclosures that you provided in the 10-K
and also some of the longer-term margin targets you've put out by segment.

If I look at where you're sitting right now in your
Nutrition and your Diagnostics businesses both of those look to be pretty close
to best-in-class margins. Can you maybe talk about the areas for operating
margin improvement, how much of that on a go-forward basis comes from the
individual segments versus how much would come from the G&A side or sort of
internal restructuring efforts?

BRIAN YOOR: Yes, David, this is Brian. So as you know we've
been growing 100, 200 operating basis points per year on an underlying basis
and we continue to see that performance in 2016. Clearly, as you said, we've
made great progress in Nutrition as well as Diagnostics as where they stand
today but that's not to say that there isn't additional opportunity.

It may not come through at the same pace that you are
accustomed to seeing it but there still is we believe remaining opportunity in
these businesses to continuously improve our margins. Over the longer term we
have some businesses like Established Pharma. Clearly there's opportunity there
in the coming years, so we see that, that that could be a driver as part of
contribution.

And don't forget, too, we are still working through the
phases of what we're doing from a G&A, taking out the unproductive spend
around the world when it comes to how we operate and support our businesses
what's the right shape and what's the right size. So I think taking all these
things into consideration, David, we're still targeting around the same range
that you've been seeing on an underlying basis. Now FX as you know is muting
that this year but the underlying is still there.

DAVID ROMAN: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe back on
the earnings guidance increase, understandably you might not want to get ahead
of yourself with respect to currency at this point, but can you maybe just talk
about the charge related to Venezuela?

It looks like you're taking up the GAAP adjustments from
$0.55 to $0.78 this quarter. How much of that is Venezuela and how much of that
is cash and are you moving anything from ongoing to one time?

BRIAN YOOR: Now, David, this is just the adjustment we're
making in Venezuela similar you've seen to other countries to take the net
monetary write-down at the end of the quarter and it's somewhere north of $0.30
and we're done. Ongoing earnings, no impact. We will do business forward at the
rate of the new floating rate which is around 2.60 but any activity if it's
minimal really won't surface at those rates.

DAVID ROMAN: Okay, and then just lastly on the top line, you
are talking about mid-single-digit organic growth of the entire year but I do
think you started at a higher rate than where you had initially contemplated.
So given things like FreeStyle Libre and the new platform launches in
Diagnostics, is there the potential to see an acceleration from the 5% that you
generated this quarter and what you're sort of guiding to in Q2?

MILES WHITE: Well, the question is how much of that have we
already got baked into our estimates for the year and how much of it will
exceed that. And let's put it this way, the fact that we're above all of your
estimates in the quarter and all businesses performed at or better than
expected I think that's a good sign. I'm just going to wait to see a little
more sign.

DAVID ROMAN: Okay, understood.

OPERATOR: Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.

LARRY BIEGELSEN, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC: Hey
guys, thanks for taking the question. Just one question on EPD and one question
on capital allocation and M&A.

First up, the last couple of quarters for EPD have been
quite strong, about 11% constant currency growth, but you're guiding to
mid-single-digit growth for EPD in Q2 if I heard correctly. So just any color
on why that business would slow down. And as I said I have one follow-up.

BRIAN YOOR: I think keep in mind we talked about this
earlier what our growth would be but for this business has that one country we
don't talk about. But if you look at India it's growing double digits, Larry,
so it's doing well.

Latin America and CFR, the performance is going well. The
integration has gone extremely well.

And I'll say Russia, and Miles mentioned that as a strong
country, we're doing very well on our performance here in Established Pharma
and our achievement, what we expect from the Veropharm acquisition that was
made. But EPD is not a straight line, Larry, as you know there's a lot of
markets. And so from time to time there can be simply just some timing of
tenders.

So there may be a little timing. I don't -- I think we are
getting ahead of ourselves here.

MILES WHITE: I think that's the best answer because we have
comparisons from quarter to quarter that depend on what happened last year in
what country and the countries don't tend to be the same. You know, this is --
because of the diversity of countries and currencies in this business, it
doesn't tend to be that nice, reliable ruler business where you can lay a ruler
down on the line of growth. It's just bumpy.

Overall it's all up and it's all good. We like that, but any
given quarter can have a curve ball in it or a comparison to last year. So I'd
say the underlying fundamentals are all strong here.

And we do have -- we're going to have to lap Venezuela
because that was a pretty significant piece for EPD given CFR there and so
forth. I'm trying to think where else. Currency I guess is an issue in a number
of countries, particularly Russia, and I'm just cycling through all the ups and
downs.

There are quarter-to-quarter variances depending on, gee,
the tender didn't happen in March, it happened in April, that kind of thing. So
I think underlying this is pretty solid strong growth.

LARRY BIEGELSEN: Fair enough. Then Miles, you said in the
past that you're not constrained on doing more deals even after the Alere
acquisition. So how should we think about Abbott's ability to do another medium-sized
transaction while the Alere deal is pending and there is some uncertainty?

And second, is a sweet spot for Abbott still that $5 billion
to $7 billion range that you've talked about in the past? Thanks for taking the
questions.

MILES WHITE: Yes, again I don't feel unreasonably
constrained at all. I think that we're always conscious of capital allocation,
we're always conscious of return, we're always conscious of where our debt is
and what our debt rating is and so forth. We want to be all in the right
balance here, but for the things that I think would be on my radar screen I
think we're in good shape here.

LARRY BIEGELSEN: Thanks for taking the questions.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Operator, we'll take one more question.

OPERATOR: Jayson Bedford, Raymond James.

JAYSON BEDFORD, ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES: Good morning. Thanks
for taking the question.

Just to follow up on the EPD, the 11% growth certainly
exceeded our number and your expectation I think going into the quarter. What
was different from your thoughts heading into the quarter? Was it a function of
tenders?

And then secondly, there were some headlines earlier in the
quarter or I guess in February around increased regulation of combo drugs in
India. And I'm just wondering does that have any impact on your business?

MILES WHITE: Well on the last part it hasn't yet but it
could. And we're prepared for that if it does. So that remains.

It's still working its way through the Indian courts. But
maybe Scott has got more detail on that right now than I do but it hasn't yet.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Yes, and I would also add just on the
quarter there is some timing, to Mile's point there is always some tender
timing in various countries. If you take the first quarter and the second
quarter you're looking at a first half of the year that will be a high
single-digit operational growth for EPD. And that's strong growth.

JAYSON BEDFORD: Okay. If I could just add a second one in
there, just on Nutrition, certainly the US Nutrition business is seeing some
pretty good signs of momentum here both in adult and pediatric. I realize you
are anniversarying some tougher comps, but are you seeing some real momentum or
at least some sustainable share gains here?

MILES WHITE: It's kind of too early to tell. I think you
kind of hope so but to call it sustainable I'd like to see some more data and
I'd like to see a little more time. Because generally speaking in the Nutrition
business in the United States share might blip up and down a little bit but
over time remains relatively static.

It's pretty difficult to move share sustainably and
meaningfully over time in the US. And your ability to grow the adult Nutrition
business is to grow the market for the most part. And as you know we are the
leader in that market.

And pediatric, share may move a couple of points here and
there but it always seems to snap back to wherever its median point was. So
we're always pushing on share gain and about the time you think you've gotten
somewhere with it something happens, competitive response or whatever, it moves
back the other way. So I think to call current momentum sustainable I think I'd
say let me see another quarter.

JAYSON BEDFORD: All right, thank you.

SCOTT LEINENWEBER: Thank you, operator, and thank you for
all your questions and that concludes Abbott's conference call. A replay of
this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's

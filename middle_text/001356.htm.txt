Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the
third-quarter 2016 Alcoa earnings conference call. My name is Shannon and I
will be your operator for today. As a reminder, today's conference is being
recorded for replay purposes.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host
for today, Matthew Garth, Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis and
Investor Relations. Please proceed.

MATTHEW GARTH, VP OF FINANCIAL PLANNING & IR, ALCOA
INC.: Thank you, Shannon. I'm joined today by Klaus Kleinfeld, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, and William Oplinger, Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer. After comments by Klaus and Bill we will take your
questions.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's
discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events
and expectations. You can find factors that may cause the Company's actual
results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's press release
and presentation and in our most recent SEC filings.

In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial
measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the
appendix to today's presentation. Any reference in our discussion today to
historical EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA, for which we have provided
reconciliations and calculations in the appendix.

Lastly, the Company completed a 1-for-3 reverse stock split
on October 5. The per share amounts in our discussion today reflect the reverse
split.

Now I'd like to turn it over to Klaus.

KLAUS KLEINFELD, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, ALCOA INC.: Thank you,
Matt. Let me characterize the quarter. Let's start with the Arconic segment.
Revenues of $3.4 billion -- that's down 1% year over year. And this basically
reflects the customer adjustments of the delivery schedules in the aerospace
industry, softness in the North American commercial transportation market,
pricing pressures, partially offset by the North American automotive volume.

The after-tax operating income at $267 million, up 4%. And
if you go down to the segments of Arconic and Global Rolled Products, $58
million of after-tax operating income, up 23% year over year. This is without
the impact of Warrick, changing Warrick over into a what we call a cold metal
plant. Remember, we have closed the Warrick smelter before. And you also see in
Global Rolled Products, a big driver of profitability is the automotive sheet
shipment up 49%.

In the Engineering Products and Solutions segment, record
third quarter profit of $162 million, up 7%. And the Transportation and
Construction Solutions business, $47 million of profit, up 7%.

Overall, also strong productivity, $187 million this
quarter. And if you look at the year-to-date number it stands at $547 million.
So, that's really good and on track to deliver the $650 million target for
2016.

We also adjusted the targets for 2016 to reflect the
near-term industry challenges. And I will talk about this in depth when we come
to the presentation at a later point in time.

Then let's also talk about future Alcoa Corporation. Total
revenues of $2.3 billion, flat sequentially. Continued lower alumina prices as
well as the impact of curtailed and closed operations.

After-tax operating income of $128 million, down 15%
sequentially. Improved metal prices offset by lower alumina prices and
unfavorable currency impact.

New third-party bauxite contracts in this quarter alone, $53
million. And at the same time, if you look at year to date, $468 million of new
third-party bauxite contracts. Very good value driver here.

And also very important to note, the Alcoa Corporation has
met or exceeded the three-year cost curve target for alumina. The alumina segment
is now on the 17th percentile of the cost curve. This is a 13 point improvement
compared to 2010. This gives you an idea of the competitiveness of this. It
basically means 83% of all industry players are under water before these
businesses will be.

Alumina is now in the 38th percentile. This is an
improvement of 13 points compared to 2010. Great job, very difficult job, and
also a lot of curtailment changes of the original footprint here.

And also in Alcoa Corporation you see a strong productivity,
$190 million productivity savings in the quarter. And overall, the year-to-date
number sits at $569 million. And that is surpassing the $550 million target for
2016. But obviously, this does not mean that the productivity push is not going
to continue.

Last but not least, but very important, the separation is
scheduled for November 1. We got a lot of things out of the way.

PBGC approval, we have that in hand. The IRS private letter
ruling we have in hand. The Alcoa Corp. team has successfully raised $1.25 billion
of debt. And we have announced both Boards. So, we are set and ready to go to
separate on November 1.

Okay, with this, I'll hand over, Bill, to you.

WILLIAM OPLINGER, EVP AND CFO, ALCOA INC.: Thanks, Klaus.
You've all seen by now adjusted earnings for the third quarter are $0.32 per
share, up 48% from a year ago, on strong productivity across all segments and
higher volumes, driven by the RTI acquisition. These gains were partially
offset by unfavorable pricing mix, primarily in our downstream businesses and
by some higher costs.

Third-quarter revenue totaled $5.2 billion, down 6% year
over year. This is driven largely by lower alumina prices and curtailments and
closures in the upstream businesses.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increased by 130
basis points sequentially largely due to the impact of lower alumina prices on
revenue. Overhead spending increased year over year primarily as a result of
costs related to the planned separation of the Company.

Other income of $117 million relates to the gain on the sale
of the wharf at our Intalco smelter location. The third-quarter effective tax
rate of 44% was driven by non-deductible separation costs and discrete tax
items in the quarter. Excluding these impacts our operational rate was 30%.

Overall net income for the quarter was $166 million or $0.33
per share. Preferred dividends were $18 million in the quarter excluding
special items. Net income was $161 million or $0.32 a share. Note that our
earnings per share reflects, as Matt commented, the reduced number of shares
following the 1 for 3 reverse stock split approved by our shareholders on
October 5.

Let's take a closer look at the special items. In the
quarter, we recorded after-tax income related to special items of $5 million or
$0.01 per share, primarily related to the gain on sale of the Intalco Wharf and
the settlement received on a prior acquisition. These gains were mostly offset
by separation costs and the aforementioned tax items.

Restructuring included charges related to previously
announced closures and curtailments, the majority of which are in our upstream
business.

Now let's look at our performance versus a year ago.
Third-quarter adjusted earnings of 161 million were up $52 million from the
prior-year quarter driven by strong productivity across all segments. Lower
alumina prices and a stronger Australian dollar, presented headwinds from a
market standpoint, while metal prices were more or less stable versus this time
a year ago.

Volume growth was driven by the RTI acquisition, now known
as ATEP, while price combined with price headwinds in packaging, prices related
to the contract renewals and supply chain destocking in the aerospace market,
were combined with the packaging headwinds. Strong productivity gains in all
segments contributed $246 million in savings, which more than offset $77
million in cost increases. The largest drivers of these cost increases included
maintenance, labor and benefits, as well as costs to secure metal as a result
of the Warrick smelter curtailment.

Now let's go to GRP. GRP turned in another strong quarter of
solid productivity gains. And growth in automotive sheet shipments were
partially offset by cost increases and the use of cold metal at Warrick, as
Klaus mentioned.

EBITDA per ton was $295 per metric ton or $354 per metric
ton excluding the Warrick cold metal impact. This is above our 2016 target of
$344 a metric ton.

As we look to the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect GRP
performance to reflect the following factors -- strong automotive sheet shipments
up 45% to 50% from a year ago, lower demand in airframe, lower North American
commercial transportation build rates. Overall, ATOI for the segment is
expected to be flat year over year at $49 million.

Please note that in the fourth quarter of last year, we
reported ATOI of $52 million, normalizing for the transfer of Warrick and the
Saudi Arabian rolling mills which will be going to the Alcoa Corp. Fourth
quarter ATOI would be $49 million.

Let's move to the EPS segment. ATOI was $162 million for the
quarter, up 7% versus the prior year. The benefit of ATEP and productivity
gains in the segment more than offset cost increases and growth project spend
like the La Porte expansion and relocation of production to low-cost locations.

Unfavorable price and mix year over year is largely related
to new contract renewals in 2016 and higher use of standard products by our
customers. As we look to the fourth quarter we believe production of aero
engines will increase. We also expect continued price pressure and airframe
supply chain destocking for legacy model components.

In addition, we expect strong North America IGT growth,
while oil and gas, European IGT and North American commercial transportation
markets will continue to be soft. Overall, for the fourth quarter we anticipate
ATOI to be up 6% to 14% year over year to $130 million to $140 million.

Now let's go to TCS. TCS third-quarter revenue declined 5%
year over year, driven by weakness in the North American heavy duty truck and
Brazilian markets, partially offset by strong performance in our building and
construction business. ATOI for the third quarter was $47 million, up 7% versus
the prior-year quarter, as productivity gains more than offset market headwinds
and cost increases.

TCS achieved record margin levels of 16.9% this quarter. As
we look to the fourth quarter we expect continued weakness in the North
American heavy-duty truck market to be offset by growth in our building and
construction business and productivity gains. Overall, fourth-quarter ATOI is
expected to be up 8% to 10% year over year to $43 million to $44 million.

Let's move to alumina. Alumina third-quarter ATOI was $72
million, a decrease of $37 million sequentially. API pricing declined 6% from
last quarter and unfavorable currency impacts due to the rising Aussie and
Brazilian real drove the decline. However, higher shipments, favorable price
mix and productivity more than offset seasonal raw material price increases and
maintenance timing.

In the fourth quarter we expect production to be up 30,000
metric tons sequentially. API pricing will continue to follow a 30-day lag, and
LME pricing to follow a 60-day lag. 85% of third-party shipments will be on
API, or spot pricing, for the full year of 2016. And we expect continued
productivity actions will offset higher energy and other cost increases.

If we turn to primary metals, primary metals third-quarter
ATOI of $56 million was up $15 million sequentially due to improved
productivity and cost control. Market factors of LME, API, and FX largely
offset each other, while lower volume was due to production stability issues in
our Iceland and Intalco smelters. Favorable energy sales in Brazil and the US
offset unfavorable power prices in Spain and Intalco.

Let me forward to the fourth quarter we expect production to
be up 10,000 metric tons as we regain stability in Iceland. And this volume
offsets downward pressure and product premiums that we're seeing. Pricing will
follow a 15-day lag to the LME, lower alumina costs of $15 to $20 per ton of alumina,
as costs in this segment follow a 90-day lag on API pricing.

We also expect structural changes in the Portland, Australia
energy contract and seasonal energy prices in Spain. These factors will drive
energy prices up $15 million after tax. And continued productivity to offset
all of these cost headwinds other than the energy headwinds that are listed
there.

If we turn to the next slide, with our pending separation
into Arconic and Alcoa Corp., I wanted to provide you with a view of what to
expect in each Company's fourth-quarter earnings. Arconic's fourth-quarter
report will include one month of GPP, or the upstream business, in the
discontinued operations line.

There will also be charges related to the separation
including two items highlighted on this slide. First, valuation allowances for
certain deferred tax assets that is a result of the separation will not be
realizable, will run through corporate and be treated as special items.
Secondly, Arconic will evaluate if there's any impairment losses associated
with the separation of Alcoa Corp. If there's an impairment loss we estimate
the range to be $300 million to $700 million. Any identified loss would go
through discontinued operations also.

Arconic segment reporting for EPS and TCS will be unchanged.
GRP will be adjusted to reflect the separation of the Warrick and Saudi Arabian
rolling mill.

For Alcoa Corp. the fourth quarter will consist of one month
of carveout financials and two months of Alcoa Corp. results. The Company will
report on all six segments. I've provided guidance on rolled products on this
slide also to support your understanding of the transfer from Arconic.

Before moving to the cash flow statement let me summarize
fourth-quarter guidance. GRP ATOI is expected to be flat, EPS ATOI up 6% to
14%, TCS ATOI up 8% to 10%, and alumina and primary metals segment combined
performance flat excluding the energy pricing impacts and, in the case of Alcoa
Corp., rolled products we expect that to decline $1 million to $2 million
sequentially.

Let's go to the cash flow statement. For the third quarter,
cash from operations was $306 million contributing to free cash flow for the
quarter of $31 million. Pension expense in the quarter of $78 million was
slightly lower than cash contributions of $80 million. Contributions year to
date of $227 million reflects 76% of our anticipated full-year total of $300
million.

We are also announcing today that we've reached an agreement
with the PBGC related to our separation. As part of the agreement Arconic will
make contributions of three payments of $50 million each during a 30-month
period following the separation.

Lastly, capital expenditures of $275 million for the quarter
included $99 million for return-seeking projects and $176 million for
maintenance separation and other sustaining projects. 58% of the capital
expenditures were in support of the Arconic businesses.

Let's now take a look at actions we've taken to strengthen
the balance sheet. Our program to offset the weakness in the commodity markets
and volatility in the debt markets exhibited earlier in the year has been
successful, generating nearly $1.2 billion. This quarter we sold the Intalco
smelter wharf and other excess property, earnings proceeds of $120 million.

The Intalco property sale will not affect our ability to use
the wharf or run the smelter. We're working to complete additional asset sales
in the fourth quarter which may raise an approximately $250 million in cash. In
total, we're expecting proceeds nearly $1.2 billion from these actions.

Now let's take a look at the balance sheet. We have very
strong liquidity and ended the quarter with $1.9 billion of cash on hand. Net
debt is in line with where we started the year. We have an additional $1.25
billion in gross debt due to the Alcoa Corp. issuance, but that money is held
in escrow until separation and therefore not included in our cash balances.

Now I'll move to a review of the aluminum market
fundamentals. Global demand remains robust at 5%, while supply has increased
slightly from last quarter, keeping the overall market balance for our 2016
aluminum balance in the deficit range of 615,000 metric tons.

Global consumption is projected to reach 59.7 million metric
tons. Since the second quarter, the data continues to support our estimates for
demand growth in China and has suggested a slight rebalancing between North
America and Europe. Aluminum supply is projected to grow by 3% year over year
to reach 59.1 million metric tons of production.

As I noted the 2016 aluminum deficit is down slightly from
last quarter to 615,000 metric tons. In China the average SHFE price this
quarter has increased 316 Renminbi, which has motivated slightly faster
restarts and expansions than we had forecast. The average LME cash price in Q3
was $1,620 per metric ton, $48 higher than the Q2 average of $1,572.

When you go to the right side of the chart, global
inventories have fallen, and we expect them to continue to fall due to the
global deficit this year. And aluminum prices have recovered substantially since
earlier in the year.

If we then turn to alumina, the alumina market is in deficit
of approximately 1.6 million metric tons, representing a larger market deficit
than what we had reported in the second quarter. The deficit increased due to
the combined impact of three main factors -- higher alumina demand in both
China and the rest of the world from increased smelter production; lower rest
of world supply, as Sherwin curtailment and slowed expansion in India combined
to lower the overall rest of world supply; and, in China, a few faster restarts
and additional expansions have increased 2016 Chinese alumina supply.

If we transition to the right-hand side of the chart,
alumina demand growth is projected to outpace supply growth, demand growing at
5%, supply growing at 1%. And prices have maintained recovery due to improving
fundamentals, recovering $31 per ton since the lows we experienced at the
beginning of the year, coming off higher prices we saw in the second quarter.
Just in the last week, however, we've seen stronger Australia prices recovering
to over $250 per ton.

Let me turn it back over to Klaus.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Yes, thank you very much, Bill. Let me
customarily start with a view on the end markets and start with aerospace
deliveries. We said in the second quarter that we see flat to plus 3% for this
year. The airline fundamentals are solid and profitability of the airlines is
at an all-time high, travel demand is up. Robust commercial jet orders, the
order book is still over nine years.

There's very low level of cancellations, 1.9% of the order
book, well below the historic numbers. But at the same time we do see 2016 as a
transition year.

In the third quarter we've seen large commercial aircraft
deliveries up 3%. The growth year to date is flat and so we believe that the
year 2016 is more likely to come out at the lower end of the range, the range
being 0 to plus 3%. We also see solid growth of narrowbodies and softening
demand for the widebody segment.

And, as I already explained last time around, it is really
important to understand what's going on there, also, inside of our business to
distinguish between the airframe components and the air engine components. So,
let me repeat that because the picture continues there as I described it
already at the end of the second quarter.

Airframe, this is for us the spectrum of fasteners,
extrusions, forgings, casting, sheet and plate. And what we see there is a
reflection as the build rate reduction that has been announced by the OEMs for
A380s, B777, and the C-Series and the part standardization and supply chain
optimization.

All of this and the overbuy we saw as an expectation of the
ramp up of the new platforms has led to an oversupply. Currently on the
airframe component side we are going through a phase of destocking that absorbs
the demand. And we actually do believe, from what we have line of sight, that
this goes through all of 2016 and continues into 2017.

On the aero engine side, which for us also large spectrum,
it means fan and turbine blades, rings, discs, shafts, structural castings, a
lot of new engine launches with multiple new technologies, product
introductions that are generating basically massive industry ramp up
challenges. There is strong engine ramp up in the second half.

We've seen that this really does not slow down but, with the
new engines ramping up and the high level of technical sophistication, there's
a lot of increased product introduction costs for qualification of the
component. And, at the same time, the legacy engine spares and replacements
remain strong. So, here we have a different situation. We have very strong
demand at the same time, the ramp up is accelerating and we're going through
the near-term teething issues here of the aero engine industry.

So, let's move on to automotive, and let's go to North
America. We believe it's going to grow 1% to 2%. In the second quarter we had a
range that stood between 1% to 4%, but we are now seeing that as a rather a
narrower range than the one that we had then.

What we do see is production is up 2.4%. But it's really a
tale of two cities. For trucks the demand is up by 7.3%, operations up by 7.3%,
and for cars it's down by 4.6%. And what we are currently seeing is the OEMs
are lining their output according to the demand.

Sales are up by 0.4%. We see a growing US inventory. It now
stands at 65 days, which is still in line with the industry target of between
60 to 65 days, but it's up three days month on month and six days year on year.
The incentives are rising. They have increased by more than 17% year over year.

Also a different picture, as you would expect, between the
cars and the trucks. On the car side, it now makes 14% of the average trading
price and on the truck side it makes 9.3% of the average trading price. In
general, the industry believes that everything below 10% is considered a
healthy margin, a healthy incentive.

So, the demand, we believe, for longer term, we do see
sustained demand picture in the US. If you just look at the vehicles in the US
that are 12 years and older, the number is more than 100 million out of 258
million that are in operation. So, it's a big chunk that potentially is there,
sitting there as the future demand.

In Europe automotive, we continue to believe it up. It's
going to be up 2% to 4%. We see the production rising by 3.7%. This is
different between the West and the East. West up by 5.2% compensated by the
East. Strong registrations and also good exports.

In China, we actually believe that it's going to be better
than what we saw in the last quarter. 6% to 8% we see here, up from the 3% to
5% that we saw before. Production is up almost 11%, sales up 11%, and some of
the legislation is helping this to get boosted. So, that's the picture on
automotive.

Let's move to the heavy duty truck and trailer market. Let's
start with North America. Unfortunately, not a good picture. We actually have
seen it continue to get worse in the second quarter. End of the second quarter
we said it's going to go down, and we saw for the year minus 26% to minus 28%.
We actually see now it's more in the minus 28% to minus 30% range.

We've seen the production coming down by 27% year to date.
Freight growth is still there but it's smaller than what was forecasted. And
obviously the psychological effect kicks in then in terms of investments for
the trucking firms.

Weak orders down 28%. Higher inventories, now it's higher
than the 10-year historical average with almost 58,000 trucks and the average
is at 47,000 trucks. And the order book is falling, down year over year by 39%.
So, not a pretty picture on that end.

In Europe, we continue to see it slowly coming up. 3% to 5%
is the growth we are seeing. Production is up by 8.3%. Also registrations in
the West are up by 16% almost, East is dropping by 5%.

And in China we also see that the stimulus programs are
taking hold. We actually saw that it's going to go 2% to 4% after the second
quarter. We now see it rather being in the 13% to 15% range. Strong sales, up
44%. Production is even up higher on a 56% level.

Packaging, actually we do see global growth rather a little
bit higher than what we saw before. Before we said 1% to 3% and now we said 2%
to 3%, very strongly driven by the US where we saw minus 1% to 0 as the picture
before. We think now it's a little bit better, 0 to 1%.

The drivers are the same. Carbonated soft drinks down, beer
segment up. And I think it's too early to tell whether this is a full trend or
whether there are some weather-related impacts here. We will see what's going
to happen going forward into the colder season in the northern hemisphere.
Europe 1% to 2% up and China 5% to 8%, no change on that.

Building and construction North America, we believe 4% to
5%. Non-residential contract award is, however, down minus 1.8%. Architectural
building index is positive for 2016 but in August the number turned to 49.7.
This is the second time it's below the critical mark of 50, so we have to watch
it.

Housing starts are up by 10.6%. And if you look at the
annualized starts, they stand at 1.2 million. This is below the long-run
average of 1.3 million. So, it has to be watched but we believe for this year
we still see a good picture there. Europe is 0 to plus 1% and China up 3% to 5%
growth.

And on the natural gas turbines we actually do see a 2% to
4% increase as the market moves to higher value-add product, higher efficiency
turbines with advanced technology. The gas turbine capacity orders up 0.7%,
strongly driven by the 60-hertz market up 7.7%. And the demand for spares and
upgrades is also good. Electricity demand is down year on year by 0.6%, so that
hasn't really changed that much yet.

Let's now talk about the businesses. Given that November 1
is almost around the corner, I decided to split it into a short part on
Arconic, which, for those that haven't followed us or have followed us, is the
old value-add businesses, so to say, and then the future Alcoa Corporation
which is the upstream business.

Let's go to Arconic. I just described to you what we see in
the end markets. And I'm happy to address this also more in depth in Q&A,
if there's an interest. But given this, as you know, our mantra is we focus on
those things that we can influence and do the best out of it. So, given this,
we are adjusting the revenue targets for 2016 but we are holding the margin
goals. So, let's go through this.

GRP -- what have we seen in the third quarter? We have seen
the profit up 23%, the EBITDA per metric ton up 7%. These are the numbers
excluding the cold metal plant aspects from Warrick.

What are we doing? We are changing the goals from what used
to be $5 billion to $5.2 billion, revenues to $4.8 billion to $5 billion, and
we are keeping the profitability target at the $344-plus per metric ton. For
the fourth quarter, as Bill has said, we are expecting the profitability to be
flat at $49 million.

So, what are the drivers for this goal change for 2016?
There are a couple of those. One is that we actually did expect that the auto
build rate would grow further, but what I just described to you is what we're
seeing now. It is plateauing, granted, on a high level and the auto
aluminization continues to be strong, so we will benefit massively from the
auto aluminization. I think Bill has shown in his slide that we are expecting
also, we had for this quarter 49% increase in auto shipments, and we are
expecting a rate between 45% to 50%, also, in the fourth quarter.

But at the same time, our expectation for build rates were
that it would continue to go up and compensate some of the other negative
effects, the big negative effect obviously here the heavy-duty truck market
decline. And then on the airframe side, the destocking of the model transition
continues on longer than we had expected. And the lower build rates that have
been announced, also, in this quarter. So that's the situation on GRP.

On TCS, we've seen in the third quarter profits have been up
by 7% and the EBITDA has been a record EBITDA margin. What we see going forward
in the fourth quarter, we actually see it will continue to go up by 8% to 10%,
and that means year over year to $43 million to $44 million. At the same time,
we can't ignore -- this includes obviously very strong our wheels business and
that's heavily impacted by what's going on in the North American heavy truck
markets, and you saw the massive decline that we are seeing there.

We obviously have taken a lot of counteractions and you see
that reflected in the profitability target continuing to be at 15%, while the
revenue target we're taking it down from what used to be at $2.1 billion to
$1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. The other thing is also sales inflicted one on
purpose, we are restructuring our Latin American extrusion business and
therefore we are purposefully losing some or taking out some revenues that we
don't think we want to continue to have going forward.

EPS -- the EPS business had a record third-quarter profit,
up 7% year over year. And the fourth quarter we expect it to be up 6% to 14% to
$130 million to $140 million. At the same time, we also have to see what is
driving the full-year revenue.

Revenues, as I mentioned already, we have on the airframe
side we have the destocking, we have the model transition, we have lower build
rates. At the same time, on the positive, we have very strong aero engine
demand. However, the industry is going through their ramp-up challenges on the
aero engine side.

Let me also mention Firth Rixson, our acquisition there. We
have been targeting the revenues of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for this year.
Firth Rixson is very strongly oriented towards the aero engine side, though we
see that realistic range as more between $900 million to $950 million revenues.
At the same time the margin level we had originally said was going to be
between 14% to 16% and we see it now more between 14% to 15%.

Also, our other acquisition, RTI, doing very well. We had
targeted $755 million to $775 million of revenue for 2016, and we continue to
hold that range. At the same time, the EBITDA margin, we originally said we
were going to come in between 17% to 19%. We believe that we're now more on the
upper range, rather on the 19%.

So, what does that mean for EPS in total? We are bringing
the revenue down from $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion to $5.6 billion to $5.8
billion range, while we are holding the profitability at the 21% level.

Let's now also talk about Alcoa Corporation. We are really
progressing in all of the business segments. And just to touch upon a few
highlights here, on the bauxite business, Juruti is at a production record. I
mentioned already $53 million of contracts for third-party bauxite in this
quarter, almost $500 million of third-party bauxite phased over the course of
the year. And that's a business that we will continue to build out as a core
corporation.

Alumina -- Saudi refinery achieved 90% of the nameplate
capacity. Good productivity there. On the energy side, Brazil third-party
revenues up 26%. Very good progress on that end helped by the pricing situation
there.

Alumina costs down by $349 per metric ton on the cast
product side. EBITDA per metric ton, 40% higher than in the prior year. And on
the rolled product side, the conversion to the cold metal plant is on track and
we see in Warrick a record year to date recovery

I think the most important message here on Alcoa Corporation
is the enormous success on coming down on the cost curve. Keep in mind, this is
a commodity business and this is all about where you are on the cost curve so
that what we've always said, that you can sustain and be profitable in whatever
environment you have.

On the alumina side, we've come down from the 30th percentile
to the 17th percentile, and on the aluminum side from the 51st percentile to
the 38th percentile. This is fantastic and above what we originally had set
here as targets.

Let's also talk about productivity, as you know, a major
part of our DNA, and a major part of the profit drivers. Also good news on
that. And we see that for future Arconic stands at this point in time at $547
million of productivity for the year, and future Alcoa Corporation stands at
$569 million. This is above, already, the annual targets, so very good job. The
team has committed to continue moving forward and keeping the pace at the rate
ideally that they have been running along this year. You also see this is
backed by more than 20,000 action sheets in the different categories for
productivity growth, as well.

So, I thought I would end it, given again that November 1 is
so close, and you from then on will be looking at two companies here and have
the opportunity to hold two stocks, I thought I'll end with giving you an idea
of what we are saying to the investors, why should you own Arconic and why
should you own Alcoa Corporation. So, let me start with Arconic.

Arconic is very strongly positioned in attractive markets.
And I would say they fall into two categories. One is secular growth with
compelling margins, like aerospace and automotive. This makes up about 50% of
the revenues.

And then the other big chunk, solid growth, attractive
margin. And this is true for transportation, specialty industrial, and building
and construction. Again, makes 50% also of the revenue.

We are clear market leader in major markets. If you just
want an indication for that, and look at the revenues in the business, the
number one or two position. Aerospace 85% of the revenues are in number one or
number two, North American auto 96%, commercial transportation 93%.

We are a major supplier to industry because of all of the
sectors that Arconic is in. Arconic is a differentiated driver via innovation
and advanced technology solutions, has unparalleled capabilities of
multi-material manufacturing processes, as well as application engineering.

Has a track record of breakthrough advances. I'm not going
to mention all of those. Also, on the recent ones, Ampliforge, metal powders,
lightning strike fasteners, Micromill, bonding. The list is long. And has a
very strong culture of innovation-driven engineering and very good research and
development base. Excellent people, and in the end it's all about people.

The margin profile is compelling, also driven by relentless
pursuit of cost reductions and consistently delivering productivity, as I just
read on the last slide. And a disciplined capital allocation.

Last, but not least, the people are everything. The
management team, as well as the culture that exists at Arconic, is focused on
performance, and is focused on creating value.

Alcoa Corp. -- what you see at Alcoa Corp. is really a
reshaped aluminum leader. And you saw it very strongly in the position on the
cost curve. What I would say, a compelling industry play here.

World-class low-cost assets, global partnerships to being in
high-growth markets, opportunities like in bauxite to continue to grow
substantially. Exciting industry outlook. Bill just went through this. Very
often we don't remember that there are not that many markets that have a demand
growth of 5%. And we have said demand is going to double in these 10 years. And
we are seeing that demand is doubling in these 10 years, and every one of us
sees it in their own environment.

I think the reshaped Alcoa Corp. is well-positioned, also,
in whatever the future will bring here. The management team is very
experienced, has been behind the drive to reshaping the firm. The culture and
the company is extremely operator centered, so running the assets well. That's really
a good discipline there. And also a disciplined approach to capital allocation,
so focus on making high returns for shareholders.

I hope that this captures your attention. And I very much
hope that you will continue to follow and invest in Alcoa Corporation as well
as Arconic going forward.

So, with this, let me conclude the presentation, and let's
go to the Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

David Gagliano, BMO Capital Markets.

DAVID GAGLIANO, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: Great. Thank
you for taking my question. I wanted to focus in on the Arconic businesses,
specifically for 2017.

I noticed in the slide deck, the second quarter, the
expectations were for more than 10% growth in 2017. And I notice that's not in
the slide deck this quarter. I'm wondering, given the change that we've seen in
aerospace, what do you expect for 2017 growth in aerospace?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Dave, you are very attentive. You noticed
that. And there's obviously a reason why we didn't put it in there.

The range -- you've seen there's a lot going on, on the aero
structure side, as well as on the aero engine side. The environment has been
more dynamic than what we had expected, even in the first quarter, second
quarter, and third quarter. And you've seen what we are projecting for the rest
of the year.

If you talk to the experts and look at the 2017, the range
that people put out there is huge, absolutely huge. And I would say it's
basically, using the stick hunting gorillas in the fog. I don't know whether
this picture works well, but it's very hard to predict.

What we are planning to do once 2017 hits, and actually once
we go on to the road show, which will be coming up soon, we will provide for
both companies, for Arconic as well as Alcoa Corporation, we will go more in
depth into the 2017 view and give you also some numbers on what we see there.
So that's our goal here. The same thing is going to hold true for Alcoa
Corporation.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Sure. We'll give better view on
supply/demand for 2017 as we go into the webcast towards the separation.

DAVID GAGLIANO: Okay, that's helpful. Just as a follow-up,
just in terms of as you build out these expectations, obviously in the
downstream businesses your order books, I'm assuming the visibility is very
high there, at least for 2017. Again, we've seen these challenges in aerospace.

I'm just wondering directionally, given those challenges,
you still delivered solid growth year over year in the EPS business. What do
you think in terms of directionally growth potential in the EPS business for
2017? Do you still foresee, for example, an up 0% to 5% sort of year in the EPS
business in terms of revenues?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: The good news is the order book is full.
And the other really good news is the demand for aero engines is gigantic. The
new engines, which are technically highly advanced, you can expect that they
cause some teething problems in a relatively complex supply chain situation,
right? So, that's what we are going through. But the desire to ramp up fast is
enormously high.

This all depends on how quickly can we get through this. We
are doing all that we can with every one of our customers, as well as part of
the supply chain, to get through this relatively quickly. But, frankly, Dave,
we will give you 2017 outlook when we go on to the road and provide, which is
in two weeks from now. So, you will get it very soon.

DAVID GAGLIANO: Okay, great. I look forward to it. Thanks.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Timna
Tanners from Bank of America.

TIMNA TANNERS, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Yes, good
morning, guys. I suspect you may answer my question similar as to the last one,
but I'm going to go ahead and ask them anyway. I know that a lot has changed
over the last year, 1.5 years, but I was just looking at the Firth Rixson
forecast from 2014 and just wondering how do we think about the EBITDA guidance
of $350 million that was initially for 2016? Is that still a good long-term
number for what Firth Rixson is capable of, aside from some of the near-term
headwinds that you've described in its own operational challenges? Or can you
give us any color on how you're thinking about Firth Rixson's past and its
going forward prospects?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Firth Rixson, as I already said earlier,
the major reason why we acquired Firth Rixson is because they are a very
important part of our aero engine component portfolio. The aero engine teething
problems affect them squarely.

At the same time, we have really made very good progress on
driving the synergies out. We are basically ahead of where we originally
thought we would come out, and also in getting the operational productivity.
And we're trying to take advantage of the aero engine ramp-ups. At the same
time, these teething problems do affect them.

I think in the long run we will get there, but you saw that
we are taking the revenue targets down for the year, as well as adjusting the
profitability to the lower end. So, obviously we are not where we wished we had
been. A good part of it is just the situation that we face in the market. In
terms of our own control, I'm actually pretty happy with the progress that
we're making. But it's work.

And let's not forget, everybody, Timna, focuses on Firth
Rixson. I also talked a little bit about RTI. In RTI, we are ahead of our plan.
We have confirmed the revenues are coming in, in the range that we always
thought, but we are going to be at the upper range of the margin at 19% much
earlier than we thought.

And, frankly, we have been able -- also, RTI is in the main
aerospace, but what you see there, the team has been not so much focused on the
aero engine side, more focused on the frame side with titanium. And the team
has been very good in overcoming the headwinds. We are ahead there with the
synergies. And, also, we've been able to get a lot of productivity out there,
too. So, that's very good.

And on TITAL, the numbers on TITAL are even more stunning.
Granted, it's smaller, but we've had over 100% growth of revenues compared to
last year, and similarly the strong profit increase. So, we're happy with where
that is going. And that's in titanium investment cast basically for Europe.

TIMNA TANNERS: Okay, got that. Thank you. I just wanted to
ask about Alcoa on the aluminum side. I feel like we had a flurry of
announcements a couple quarters ago about curtailing capacity of high-cost US
operations. And I just wondered if there's any progress in looking at some of
the other operations that may be higher cost than any programs or plans that
you can detail for us?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: That's a good point, Timna. We have been
part of that because we announced a couple of closures, as you know, in the US.
We originally had planned to close Massena, and we also had planned to close
Intalco. We did close Wenatchee.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: We curtailed Wenatchee, not closed.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: And in the discussions here in the north
country in New York, we were able to achieve a power contract that got us into
a profitable situation, so we didn't have to close it. And the same thing
actually, to our surprise, happened on the Intalco side, and that's why we also
kept Intalco running, and profitably running. So, that's been what has been
going on there.

TIMNA TANNERS: Okay, thank you.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Evan
Kurtz from Morgan Stanley.

EVAN KURTZ, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hi, good morning, guys.
Just a quick one on the new segments as we start to think about how to model
these things going forward: When should we expect more updates as far as
revised Form 10, just filling in some of the blanks that we got on the first
Form 10 as far as segment ATOIs for the new groupings?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: We've had four versions of the Form 10 at
this point. If you recall, we were able to give you the first quarter and then
the first half. We will have more information available to you in the early
part of November. So, right after the close of the separation, you'll get more
information on the segments then.

EVAN KURTZ: Okay, great. And then just a question on how you
price third-party bauxite sales: We can for the first time look at what the
revs are in that business and get a sense of what revenue per ton is. What's
included in that revenue? Are there freight costs?

When you sell bauxite, what's the delivery point? Is it the
mine? Is it the port? Is it delivered in China?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Just to be clear, on our revenues in
bauxite, you've got a combination of internal and external. The internal
revenues are internal transfer pricing where we try to approximate market as
best as we can. It's very difficult to approximate a market where the mine is
sitting right next to the refinery, but we make a best attempt to have a market
and arms-length pricing there.

For the external revenues, they are largely including
shipping costs over to China. So, they are on a delivered-into-China basis.

EVAN KURTZ: Great. And then just one last question on
working capital: It's been a big use of cash this year and, actually, if you
look at the first nine months of last year. Is there a seasonal pattern here?
Should we expect some sort of release as we get into the year end?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Absolutely, and you've seen it year in and
year out. We've tried to do a better job of smoothing out over time.

But we typically burn working capital. It's a consumption of
cash, through the first nine months, and then we deliver cash back in the
fourth quarter. And that's been consistent.

Historically you see it in both businesses, probably a
little bit more on the Arconic side. Both businesses will typically generate
cash in the fourth quarter.

EVAN KURTZ: Great, thanks. I'll hand it over.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Jorge
Beristain from Deutsche Bank.

JORGE BERISTAIN, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Good morning, guys.
Again, just trying to follow-up a bit on the downstream businesses, I'm just
going to recap, but over the last three years roughly since 2014, you've added
over $1.5 billion of revenue, particularly in the EPS business, but we've yet
to see any real incremental pickup in EBITDA.

So, I'm trying to understand what is it that fixes this
business going forward? What is going to be the turnaround inflection? Is it
going to be revenue starting to flow through in 2017?

Are there internal cost cuts that you can keep doing?
Because it just seems that those assets have just not been performing to snuff,
or the stuff that was in downstream is just performing a lot weaker than it was
also previously expected. So, I'm just trying to understand what is the
inflection point and what should we be looking for, for this business to start
to perform as to what the guidance was when you initially acquired them.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: When you talk about downstream, I assume
you're talking about all of the Arconic businesses?

JORGE BERISTAIN: Sorry, more focused just on engineered
products and solutions.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: I see. On engineered products and
solutions, I actually think -- let me recap what is hitting here and why the
revenue is trending below our expectations. The airframe structures, we see
strong demand for narrowbodies, but softer demand for widebodies. It's public
knowledge. We can't make the market. We would love to have it in a different
way.

You look at the A380 announcement, the 777 announcement, the
C-Series, plus the Boeing third-quarter deliveries of 5% lower than the third
quarter last year. At the same time, we have the additional pressure from the
destocking and the supply chain. So, that's one factor.

The second factor is the aero engine launches, and that's a
major driver of our revenues here in EPS. We do see that there's a lot of
demand there, but it's basically a multi-step supply chain. And we currently do
see some supply chain challenges here on the aero engine side.

Supply chain is long. It goes from the material to the metal
forming to machining to final assembly. And when you go through this, you
actually have to invest in the qualification, and that's the phase that's
currently going on.

But the interesting thing on both sides, the fundamentals of
the businesses are very strong. The aerospace market, the number that I find
most convincing is always to look at -- because it's all driven by the macros
growth of middle class and urbanization -- the number that I find most
interesting is, every year the aerospace industry adds about 100 million more
passengers from Asia alone. So, that gives you an idea of the strong market
that's out there.

At the same time, when you look at the margin level here, we
are performing at a margin level of about 21% here. And we have, when you look
at, Jorge -- and you have been one who has been following us for a long time --
when you look at where we were in 2008 with all of these businesses, and with
the organic businesses, as well as what we added organically and inorganically,
this was an 8% business and we've brought it to this level.

We will continue to work on that, and continue to improve
and continue to grow. We are focusing on those things that we can influence,
and there are certain things that we can't influence. But, as I said, the
fundamentals are very strong. We have to get through these launch issues that
exist.

JORGE BERISTAIN: Okay. Sorry, but just to recap, then, on
the launch issues, is it that there's the qualification growing pains that are
happening right now with the new engine launches and you would expect margins
to improve, say, in 2017, once you're flowing the product better? I'm just
trying to understand what the drivers could be next year.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Yes, you're absolutely right, because what
is happening in the qualification period, you have a lower first pass yield,
you have additional qualification costs, you have a lower utilization of your
equipment. This is changing dramatically once you are going into steady state
-- I mean, dramatically once you go into steady state.

JORGE BERISTAIN: Okay, that's what I was trying to get at.
Thank you.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Because the other thing, keep in mind, this
is the crazy thing here, demand is massive and everybody is working tirelessly
on getting this done.

JORGE BERISTAIN: Got it. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Justin
Bergner from Gabelli & Company.

JUSTIN BERGNER, ANALYST, GABELLI & COMPANY: Good
morning, Klaus. Good morning, Bill. A couple quick questions: In regards to the
EPS segment, could you help us understand the breakout between engines and
airframe? And if airframe is what's driving the weakness, how is it that RTI's
guidance on a sales basis is unchanged within the segment?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Let me start with the last one. The RTI is really
a big compliment to what the RTI folks have been achieving there. This is
spectacular that they have been able to get to this level.

And largely, it's three factors, I would say. One is the
synergies that we had planned for all the time. We got them implemented very
fast.

Secondly, it's productivity that we have been getting out,
partially also by doing some things there, taking best practices that we are
moving over from other businesses over to RTI. And, thirdly, through a very
good positioning in the market and a huge proximity to the customer. It's a
great job by the team.

To your second point, when you look at EPS, out of EPS about
76% of the EPS revenues are -- and this is 2015 number, approximation -- 76% is
the aero market. And then if you break that out into engine and structure, I
would say it's roughly 50/50 between engine and structure.

JUSTIN BERGNER: Thank you for that detail. One other
question, if I may? Have you clarified what the costs are to undergo the
separation in total, and what the extra cost will be to have two stand-alone
businesses versus one? And if not, when do you expect to provide those numbers?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: I'll answer the second one, first. On a
dissynergies basis we have identified fairly small levels of dissynergies that
we think we can largely overcome with efficiencies. So, the dissynergies that
we would be looking at, of course you've got two CFOs, for example. We're
looking at ways that we can -- probably not a great example (laughter), but it
is a dissynergy. So, you've got two different companies and we're looking for
ways to streamline.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: I would not recommend a company without a
CFO.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: No, you get the point. As far as the
overall separation costs, at this point we haven't given much in the way of
guidance. But I can tell you we have spent around $200 million in cash year to
date on separation, but we still have some spend left to do in this last month.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: And also, just as a little fun fact on the
side, we have been very substantially benchmarking, as we always do, how the
costs for separation typically are for others. And we are very proud of how
efficient we have been in the separation and how low our separation costs have
been relative to what we've seen at other places.

JUSTIN BERGNER: Great. Thank you. It does seem like the
costs have come in lower, but we'll await final detail.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Yes, and you will get this. You will really
get this when both teams go on to the road shows. As I said, both are planning
to start this in two weeks from now, so you will also get a glimpse on to 2017.

We probably have time -- we might not have time -- but time
for one more question. One more, is that possible?

OPERATOR: Your final question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto
from Cowen and Company.

TONY RIZZUTO, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Thank you. Hi,
gentlemen. My question is on the jet engine side. Klaus, you mentioned some of
the supply chain challenges. I was wondering, how are those jet engine
deliveries facing in the fourth quarter? Earlier you were expecting a fairly
good ramp in 4Q.

And then, also, possibly associated with that, when you talk
about teething pains I noticed that one of the Japanese airlines, ANA, has been
talking about issues revolving around the turbine blade material, at least on
the Rolls Royce engine for the 787. I don't know if GE is experiencing similar
issues. But about the engine deliveries that you're seeing in 4Q, is Arconic
currently sourcing any of the materials that go into that blade material?
Whatever you could tell us on that would be great.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Look, obviously I cannot speak for our
customers. One thing I can tell you, we are supplying, and you know this, we've
gotten the charts out there where you see we are literally supplying every
commercial jet engine that exists on this planet. And on many of those we have
a lot of material on there. So, we are basically supporting all of them to
manage what I would call an unprecedented ramp-up. It was really multiple, very
challenging new technologies.

What we typically have is, in this phase, the supply chain,
as I described, is relatively long, so we are supplying aluminum lithium, for
instance, for fan blades. And then it goes to a machine shop, and then it goes
to some coating, and then it goes to somebody who basically puts all these
pieces together. So, the chain is long. And then it's final tested and built
in.

The only way how you can get a hold of these issues is to
get your arms around the whole supply chain under the guidance of the OEM. And
that's how this industry is working this out. So, with pretty much everybody we
have jointly committed action plans and we are fulfilling those.

TONY RIZZUTO: Okay. All right, that's very helpful. I
appreciate that. I was going to ask another, but I'll get that offline. Thank
you.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Okay, we've got to move on, so let me
conclude. I think you saw that with all that's going on we steered steady
through this quarter, delivered profits growth at Arconic, and Alcoa Corporation
performed well in a low pricing environment. Productivity was exceptional.

Alcoa Corporation has delivered on its 2016 cost curve
growth, actually overachieved them. The three-year target adjustment at Arconic
reflects basically the near-term industry realities.

The fundamentals, let's not forget the questions -- thank
you very much for the questions -- the fundamentals in the key markets remain
solid. Separation is on track and we are looking forward very much to launching
two new companies on November 1. So, this will be the last time we will get
together on this constellation, after 128 years -- not with everybody in the
room.

So, thank you very much for listening to us and paying
attention. I'm very much looking forward to also see you as investors and as
interested parties going forward for Alcoa Corporation, as well as Arconic.
Thank you very much.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the
second quarter 2016 Alcoa earnings conference call. My name is Shawntelle, and
I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, today's conference is being
recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to
your host for today, Matthew Garth, Vice President of Financial Planning and
Analysis and Investor Relations. Please proceed.

MATTHEW GARTH, VP OF FINANCIAL PLANNING, ANALYSIS & IR,
ALCOA INC.: Thank you, Shawntelle. I'm joined today by Klaus Kleinfeld,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and William Oplinger, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by Klaus and Bill, we
will take your questions.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's
discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events
and expectations. You can find factors that may cause the Company's actual
results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's press
release and presentation, and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we
have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion.
Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be
found in today's press release, and in the appendix to today's presentation,
and on our website at 

 under the "Invest"
section.

Any reference in our discussion today to historical EBITDA
means adjusted EBITDA, from which we have provided reconciliations and
calculations in the appendix. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to
Klaus.

KLAUS KLEINFELD, CHAIRMAN & CEO, ALCOA INC.: Yes. Thank
you, Matt. So let's get started by characterizing the quarter in the usual
fashion. We continue to improve our businesses, and we have provided you with a
lot of information that show already the two companies that are soon to come,
Arconic, our value-add business, and Alcoa Corporation, our current upstream.

So let me start with Arconic. The Arconic segments have
revenues in the second quarter of $3.5 billion, up 1% year-over-year. And this
is a composition of 5% revenue increase, mainly related to acquisitions, offset
by 4% predominantly coming from metal price impact. EPS has revenues of $1.5
billion in that, that's up 15%. All of these are year-over-year numbers.

After-tax operating income came out at $294 million, that's
up 3%. Global Rolled Products in the $68 million after-tax, record quarter for
automotive sheet shipment, up 17%. Engineered Products and Solutions record
after-tax operating income of $180 million, up 9%. Transportation and
Construction Solutions, $46 million, up 5%.

We also signed in this quarter, a multi-year contract with
Embraer, valued at approximately $470 million, and proudly shown today at the
Farnborough Air Show. And we also opened the state-of-the-art 3D printing
metals powder production facility geared towards making metals for 3D-printing,
mainly for titanium, nickel and aluminum alloys powders in the aerospace world.
And on top of it, we achieved $176 million productivity savings in the second
quarter. For the first half, this adds up for Arconic to $360 million. So we
are on target to deliver the target of $650 million in 2016.

So Alcoa Corporation, the total revenues of $2.3 billion, up
7% here. It's all sequentially, this is the way the market looks at that in the
commodity space. Predominantly, this is driven by 22% higher alumina prices.
It's 2% higher aluminum pricing organic growth, and slightly offset by
curtailed, divested and closed operations. The third-party revenues are at $1.8
billion, up 9%. After-tax operating income stands at $150 million, up
sequentially as pricing improved. Productivity savings also clearly playing
into this.

We secured a $60 million of a new third-party bauxite sales
contract that stretches over the next two years, and we reached a power
agreement for the Intalco smelter in Washington state which improves the
competitiveness, and we fully curtailed Point Comfort, our Texas refinery. And
lastly, great productivity, $199 million productivity in the second quarter
adds up to $379 million for the first half, and going well against the target
of $550 million in 2016.

And last but not least, the separation is on track. Ten days
ago roughly, we filed our initial Form 10 on June 29, and the separation will
happen in the second half 2016. Bill, with this, over to you.

WILLIAM OPLINGER, EVP & CFO, ALCOA INC.: Thanks, Klaus.
Let's begin by reviewing the income statement. Second quarter revenue totaled
$5.3 billion, down approximately 10% year-over-year. Growth from recent
acquisitions and organic growth was offset by lower alumina and metal pricing,
and the impact of divested and closed businesses.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales decreased by 210
basis points sequentially, largely due to the impact of higher metal and
alumina prices on revenue, as well as productivity gains. Overhead spending
increased year-over-year, primarily as a result of costs related to the planned
separation of the Company, and the acquisition of RTI. Other income of $37
million relates primarily to the previously announced sale of the Australian
natural gas pipeline, as well as a supplier arbitration recovery related to a
fire in our Iceland facility in 2010.

The second quarter effective tax rate of 46.1% was driven by
nondeductible separation costs, tax associated with the sale of corporate owned
life insurance, and discrete tax items in the quarter. Excluding these impacts,
our operational rate was 31%.

Overall, net income for the quarter was $135 million or
$0.09 per share. Preferred dividends were $17 million in the quarter. Excluding
special items, net income was $213 million or $0.15 a share.

Let's take a closer look at the special items. In the
quarter, we recorded after-tax charges of $78 million or $0.06 per share,
primarily related to portfolio transaction costs, and the aforementioned tax
items. All of our portfolio transaction costs this quarter stem from work being
done to separate the Company.

Restructuring across the business included charges related
to previously announced curtailments in our upstream business, plus headcount
reductions associated with lower market demand, largely in the aerospace
businesses, and in our extrusions business in Latin America. Note that roughly
20% of the restructuring-related charges are non-cash. In addition, included in
the special items are the gains from the sale of the Australian pipeline, and
the recovery related to the Iceland transformer fire in 2010.

Now let's look at our performance versus a year ago. Second
quarter adjusted earnings of $213 million were down $37 million from the prior
year quarter, driven largely by the drop in alumina and metal prices. Lower
price mix was predominantly related to contract renewals and OEM supply chain
efforts in the aerospace businesses.

Strong productivity gains in all segments contributed $237
million in savings, which are much more than offset by the $52 million of cost
increases. The largest drivers of these cost increases include maintenance,
labor, and benefits, as well as the cost to secure metal as a result of the
Warrick smelter curtailment. Lower energy prices in Brazil and the US drove a
decline in energy sales year-over-year.

Now let's move to the segment results, starting with GRP.
GRP turned in another strong quarter, as solid productivity gains and reduced
growth project spending were partially offset by cost increases, and the use of
cold metal at Warrick after the smelter shutdown. EBITDA per metric ton was
$326 per metric ton, or $380 per metric ton excluding the Warrick impact. This
is well above our 2016 target of $344 a ton, a target which we expect to meet
or exceed.

As we look to the third quarter of 2016, we expect GRP
performance to reflect the following factors. Strong automotive sheet
shipments, up 50% from a year ago, lower aero demand from continued inventory
destocking and model transitions, lower commercial transportation build rates,
and $15 million of after-tax costs as a result of the Warrick smelter
curtailment. Overall, ATOI for the segment is expected to be up 5% to 10%
excluding the Warrick impact.

EPS, the Engineered Products and Solutions business posted
record revenues for the second quarter, up 15% year-over-year, primarily driven
by the inclusion of RTI, now known as ATEP. This increase was partially offset
by pricing pressure, supply chain inventory destocking, and weaker demand for
legacy platforms and widebody aircraft. ATOI was $180 million for the quarter,
up 9% versus the prior year. ATEP contributed ATOI of $21 million in the
quarter.

Productivity gains in the segment more than offset cost
increases, and growth project spend like the LaPorte expansion and the
relocation of production to low cost locations. Unfavorable price mix
year-over-year is largely related to new contract renewals in 2016, and higher
use of standard products by our customers. As we look to the third quarter, we
believe production of jet engines and new aircraft models will increase. We
also expect continued price pressure and accelerated airframe supply chain
destocking for legacy model components. In addition, we expect strong North
America IGT growth, while oil and gas, European IGT and North American
commercial transportation markets will continue to be soft. Overall, for the
third quarter, we anticipate ATOI to be up 5% to 10% year-over-year at current
exchange rates.

Now let's go to the TCS segment. TCS, the second quarter
revenue declined 5% year-over-year driven by weakness in the North American
heavy duty truck and Brazilian markets, partially offset by strong performance
in our building and construction business. ATOI for the second quarter was $46
million, up slightly versus the prior year quarter as productivity gains more
than offset market headwinds and cost increases.

TCS achieved record margin levels with an EBITDA margin of
16.3% in the second quarter. As we look to the third quarter, we expect
continued weakness in the North American heavy duty truck market, offset by
growth in our building and construction business, and productivity gains. Overall,
third quarter ATOI is expected to be up 1% to 3% year-over-year.

Now let's move to Alumina. Alumina second quarter ATOI
improved by $101 million due to higher API pricing, which increased 22% from
the first quarter. Lower energy and raw material costs, combined with strong
productivity at our operating locations more than offset unfavorable currency.
In the quarter, we benefited from increased third-party bauxite sales and
better margins from our partnership mines.

As of the end of the second quarter, we have fully curtailed
our Point Comfort refinery. Including the reduction from this curtailment,
production for the third quarter is expected to be up 20,000 metric tons. In
the third quarter, we expect API pricing to follow a 30 day lag, and LME pricing
to follow a 60 day lag. 85% of our third-party shipments will be on API or spot
during the course of the year, and ATOI is expected to be up $5 million
excluding the impacts of pricing and currency.

Let's turn to Primary Metals. Primary Metal's second quarter
ATOI improved by $27 million sequentially due to higher metal prices and lower
input costs. We also benefited from the closure of the Warrick smelter in this
segment. These favorable impacts were only partially offset by lower energy
sales in Brazil and the US.

Looking forward to the third quarter, we expect production
to be up due to the additional day in the quarter. Pricing will follow a 15 day
lag to the LME, higher alumina costs of $35 to $40 per ton of aluminum as prior
quarter prices flow through our inventory, and productivity will offset
seasonal higher energy prices. ATOI in this segment is expected to be flat,
excluding the impacts of pricing and currency.

Before moving to the cash flow statement, let me summarize
the third quarter guidance. GRP ATOI is expected to be up 5% to 10% excluding
the Warrick impact. EPS ATOI up 5% to 10%. TCS up 1% to 3%, and the upstream,
up $5 million excluding price and currency impacts.

Now let's look at the cash flow statement. In the second
quarter, cash from operations was $332 million, contributing to free cash flow
for the quarter of $55 million. This result included the investment of $200
million in the Western Australia gas supply contract.

Pension expense in the quarter of $85 million was slightly
greater than cash contributions of $77 million. The contributions year-to-date
of $147 million represent nearly 50% of our anticipated full year total of $300
million. Lastly, capital expenditures of $277 million for the quarter included
$146 million for return-seeking projects, and $131 million for maintenance and
other sustaining projects. Two-thirds of the capital expenditures were in
support of the Arconic businesses.

Let's now take a look at actions we've taken to strengthen
the balance sheet. Going into this year, we saw weakness in the commodity
markets, and volatility in the debt markets. With that, we've taken swift
action to strengthen our balance sheet, including the initiation of a program
to sell nonessential assets. The program has been very successful, and I would
like to you update you on our progress.

We sold our stake in the Western Australia pipeline and
ATEP's medical device business, generating nearly $250 million in proceeds in
the second quarter. We also redeemed the corporate-owned life insurance program
which was set up a number of decades ago. Those sales generated $457 million in
the first half. Lastly, we sold assets held by our captive insurance company in
the second quarter generating an additional $111 million in proceeds.

In the second half of the year, we expect to complete
additional asset sales with proceeds of approximately $400 million. These
include the Yadkin hydroelectric project in North Carolina, property at the
former Eastalco smelter site, and the Intalco smelter wharf. The Intalco
property sale will not affect our ability to use the wharf or run the smelter.
In total, we're expecting proceeds of $1.2 billion from these actions.

Now let's take a look at how these items benefited the
balance sheet. We have very strong liquidity, and we ended the quarter with
$1.9 billion of cash on hand, $600 million higher than the same time last year.
Net debt at $7.2 billion compares favorably with the net debt of second quarter
2015 at $7.4 billion, and the prior quarter at $7.7 billion.

And now, I'll move to a review of the aluminum market
fundamentals. We've updated our view of the market slightly since last quarter.
Global demand growth remains at a robust 5%, while supply growth of 2.5% is up
50 basis points from our Q1 estimate, resulting in an aluminum deficit of
775,000 metric tons.

Let me discuss China briefly. 2016 Chinese demand growth at
6.5% is driven largely by Chinese government stimulus in the property market.
However, we've also seen improved electrical end use, and strong demand in the
transport and packaging sectors. On the supply side, China is increasing by
roughly 3%. But it's important to note that China's net supply growth rate is
the lowest it has been since the global financial crisis. Even outside of
China, we see the majority of growth coming from Asia, while North America has
curtailed significant production, putting rest of the world on track for
approximately 2% supply growth in 2016.

Now let's take a more detailed look at the aluminum
environment. As I said on the prior chart, projection is currently 775,000
metric ton deficit in the market for 2016. It's important to note that China is
not exporting significant primary metal currently. Inventories continue to
decline, with a 7% decline versus a year ago, and 8% decline sequentially. LME
and China stock reductions are the big drivers behind this reduction. The
continued global deficit has resulted in all-in prices recovering globally.

If I turn to the alumina market for 2016, alumina demand
growth is projected to outpace supply growth globally. Consistent with our
first quarter forecast, the alumina market remains in a 1.5 million metric ton
deficit, with China importing 3.5 million metric tons of alumina, and the rest
of the world in deficit, post exports to China. However, this level of China
imports are down slightly from our last projection, as approximately 40% of
curtailed capacity has been confirmed to have restarted as of the second
quarter in response to stronger domestic Chinese alumina prices.

The price has maintained its recovery due to the improving
fundamentals, rising $45 per ton since the lows we experienced at the beginning
of the year, and remaining consistent with the prices we saw at the end of the
first quarter. So let me turn it back to you, Klaus.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Yes. Thank you very much. And as customary,
let me start with a view on the end markets, and let's start with the aerospace
market. As we have discussed already, quite well in the last quarter this 2016,
in the aerospace market is clearly a transition year, and we have been seeing
some of this actually today in the announcements from Farnborough, so it's
really a world of two different halves.

In the first half, if you look at large commercial aircraft
deliveries, they have been down by 1%. At the same time, if you calculate the
full year, we believe that it's going to be flat to plus 1%. But we do see that
there is now a very careful ramp-up of the new models, the teething problems
that we have particularly seen on some of the new technology are more on the
jet engine side have been solved and the orders are coming in.

However, the lower orders are there for legacy models. But
we do, we have seen, particularly on the jet engine side, strong June
deliveries, second best month on record. And we do believe that the second half
is going to show a growth of 6% versus the first half. We do also believe, that
given this transition, that demand is going to move over or has moved over into
2017. That's why we projected double-digit growth for 2017 over 10%.

We do see a very robust commercial jet order book, over nine
years of production, solid airline fundamentals here. IATA projects the airline
profitability at all-time high, with $39 billion of net profits expected. And
when you look also at the cancellation rate, the cancellation rate in the first
half for instance, it stands at 0.6%. That is lower than what we've seen even
in the last year, so fundamentals are strong.

I added a part here, that's important for what is the
implication of all of this for us. Because there is a difference, when you
distinguish between airframe components and jet engine components. Airframe
components like fasteners, extrusions, forgings, casting, sheet and plate. And
number one, we do see reduced rate of legacy widebody aircraft. So that's an
immediate effect.

The second effect is, when you look at what has happened,
particularly on the large volume platforms, the move over from the A320 to the
A320neo, or 737 to the 737 MAX, the OEMs have done a very, very good job in
standardization, and the supply chain optimization. So that's the second thing
that we see there. And we will, therefore, see that near-term demand will be
filled basically through destocking.

The situation on the jet engine components is very, very different.
And here I'm talking about fan and turbine blades, rings, discs, shafts,
structural casting. The new engines have launched.

They have multiple technology. And it's now all about the
execution, in terms of ramping up the supply chain challenges, after the
coolish first half, starting already in the end of last year. So this is all
going into a very, very different phase now. At the same time, the legacy
engine spares and replacements will remain strong. So here demand is clearly
leading to new orders, and we do see that already in our order book.

So second market, end market, let's go to automotive. North
America, we expect 1% to 4% growth. Production is up by 2.6% year-to-date. The
sales are healthy, at a plus 1.3% year-to-date.

And if you look at the numbers, you're talking about 17.4
million cars. This is a peak since basically 2000, where it was, the last
record was 17.3 million cars. And the light truck share now has reached 60%.
That's obviously also very important for us, in regards to aluminum intensity.

We do also see going forward, when you look at vehicles that
are over 12 years old, they are adding up to 104 million vehicles, out of 258
million that are in operation. So there's probably some pent-up demand in
there. We also do see the inventories are stable at 66 days. That's kind of in
the target range. Incentives are up, but so are prices.

In Europe, we believe growth of 2% to 4%, production is up
4.1%. In the west, 6.1%, offset by minus 8.5% in the east, and registrations
are also up 9.9%, and exports are up too, with 4.8%. China also, we see up 3%
to 5%, strong production, with plus 5.2%. Sales are up 6.5%, or 9.3%
year-over-year. And also very interesting, driven by strong similarity here to
the US, driven by a surge in SUVs and CUVs, basically crossover utility
vehicles, basically smaller SUVs. And the demand has increased there by 34.7%
year-over-year.

Heavy trucks and trailer, the next segment, North America,
we do continue to see a decline, minus 26% to minus 28%. Production is down 22%.
Year-to-date stands at 107,000 trucks, was 137,000 last year. Weak orders, down
35%, and year-to-date down -- basically 40%.

Inventory is high, with 64,500 trucks, 27% higher than the
historic 10 year average that stands basically at 47,400 trucks. The order book
is falling, and it stands at 108,900, down 35%. However, it's still above the
historic average of 101,000 cars. Let's not forget in this, that the order
intake last year was at a near record, near record high.

In Europe, we actually believe it's going to point up, 3% to
5% strength. In Western Europe production is up by 2.4%. Registration in
Western Europe, up 18.4%. Orders up 5%. We do see a decline, however, in
Eastern Europe of 16.6%.

China, we also see it pointing up, 2% to 4%, strong sales up
25% here, and production up also 25%. If you look at the year-to-date, then
10%. So there's probably even some upside possible here.

Packaging, really no change, North America minus 1% to 0%,
Europe, 1% to 2%, China, 5% to 8%, with no change to the past. Building and
Construction, we do believe that North America is going to go up 4% to 5%,
nonresidential contracts awarded up 1.3%.

Architectural Billings Index is positive, with 53.1, and has
been positive for 24 out of the last 26 months. Housing starts up 10.6%. That's
all good.

In Europe, we actually see, obviously Europe is not one
thing, but overall we see minus 1% to plus 1%. And in China we do believe is
plus 3% to plus 5%. Lastly, industrial gas turbines, we continue to see this
market coming back, with plus 4% to -- plus 2% to 4%. Very strongly, through
the new heavy duty gas turbines, the orders are up by 4.3% in the first
quarter. 60 Hertz is growing, 6.9% April year-to-date. And all of this is also
driving demand for spares and component upgrades on existing turbines.

So let's also talk about the business, and I have also
structured my presentation along the future. So let's start with the Arconic
businesses. So let me summarize the highlights that you just heard also from
Bill.

GRP. GRP in the second quarter, EBITDA per metric ton is
$380, up 11%. This excludes the Warrick special impact. Strong productivity,
record quarter for auto sheet shipments, up 17%. The outlook, we continue to
see a positive trend here, and we believe it's going to be up 5% to 10%. Also
that is excluding the alternative metal supply at Warrick.

TCS, revenues are down, the North American truck and the
Brazilian market pressures have basically done that in the second quarter, but
record EBITDA, profitability and strong productivity. We believe that we will
continue to see the segment in spite of the headwinds grow. We believe the
after-tax operating income to be up 1% to 3% going forward into the third
quarter.

EPS, record revenues, 15% growth year-over-year primarily
driven by the acquisition. And I also talked about the aero market dynamics
here. We believe we will continue to see this positive trend in the third
quarter. We believe ATOI is going to be up 5% to 10%. So all groups on track to
meet their 2016 goals.

So let me highlight a few businesses, and start with Firth
Rixson. Firth Rixson, we talked about quite a bit in the last quarter. So Firth
Rixson is on track to achieve the 2016 target. We have seen in the first half
revenues of $468 million, at a profit margin of 15.4%, and profits of $72
million.

We have been able to improve, as well as sustain our
operational performance. Synergies have added up to $47 million. This is well
ahead of our year-end target which stands at $51 million. And we have been able
to debottleneck some of the production processes, which is particularly
important for the second half.

I talked about the dynamics in the aerospace market. As we
are ramping up the production for the next generation engine platforms, always
keep in mind, Firth Rixson is in the main around jet engines. So this is in a
nice, sweet spot.

Savannah, we also talked about our isothermal operation
qualifications is doing okay. 60% of the parts are forged and to qualifications
under way, so basically 12 out of the 19 parts that we have in there. And we're
targeting that the revenues will be ramping up in 2017 then, once they are all
qualified. So let me also -- so this is all I have today on Firth Rixson.

Let me also give you similar update on what was formerly
RTI, and is now called ATEP. And here you see it on the slide. So ATEP is ahead
of the integration plan. When we acquired the business, the pro forma numbers
were at a margin of 14.5%.

If you look at the profitability in the first half of 2016,
we're now standing at a 20% EBITDA margin with $400 million revenues and $80
million profits. And when you look at the synergies, we have currently
synergies of about -- achieved synergies of $55 million. So we are more than
one year ahead of our year-end 2017 target, that was $47 million.

We have quite a full list of steps that we are undertaking
here, I'm not going to go through them all. We have a clear path how to hit the
target, and you can see them here on the right-hand side. And so, we are on a
good path, they're actually on a very, very good path there. We are ahead of
our own plan.

I didn't prepare a chart, but I want to also fill you in on
our titanium investment casting acquisition in Europe, Tital. Tital is showing
a strong top and bottom line performance, well ahead of our business case. So
all of these actions, and many more have allowed us to be very, very
well-positioned on the next generation structures as well as engines.

This slide, you have seen some versions of this before. This
is an update, also reflecting the latest wins. And you see on the left-hand
side, you see the revenues per aircraft. And this, what you see are the light
blue reflects the revenues that we have per aircraft, indexed to the 737NG. And
then on the right-hand side, you basically see the new generation platform, and
what the revenues basically per ship set are on this. And as you see here very
well, we've been really very well able to build out our position on the
structures, and at the same time, also on the jet engine. So we've gained
share, substantially improved our position. And obviously, as the market is
taking off and working through the backlog, we are well-situated for the years
to come here.

Let me also remind you, that Alcoa has always been a leader
in aerospace innovation. More than 90% of all aerospace alloys that are in
service were invented by Alcoa, and we are always charging ahead on the next
frontier. And in that light, we have shown that we are today leading in
additive manufacturing in aerospace. We opened in July, our metal powder plant.
The metal powder plant is geared towards titanium, nickel, and aluminum alloys,
powder alloys optimized for the 3D-printing and for aerospace components.

We are advancing the feedstock as well as the processes as
well as the product design as well as the qualification. That's the beauty of
being in this industry for such a long time, and understanding what is required
to make things successful. At the same time, we are developing exclusive
advanced processes, processes like Ampliforge. Ampliforge basically allows us
to finish a 3D-printed metals component using a traditional process, and by
this enhancing the properties, and reducing also the material input.

And what we are very happy about is, that this is recognized
also by very important customers. We are already seeing that customers are
drawn towards this, and find this very attractive. So this allowed us to win a
supply agreement with Airbus for 3D-printed titanium fuselage and engine pylon
components. The first delivery of this is going to happen, basically as we
speak in the third quarter of this year.

So let's also take a quick look onto the automotive market.
And with this, let me be very clear. The aluminization as I call it, of North
American auto platform content use. And this, the data of the market experts
here, and it is not just -- which is very often understood -- it is not just
about the fully aluminum intense vehicles. You also have to look at the
closures components.

I mean, look at hoods here. Hoods are predicted to go up
from a penetration of 6% to 28%, doors 43% to 73%, liftgates and trunks, 7% in
2015 to 26% in 2020. Fenders 6%, up to 19%. And this is -- now go to the
right-hand side of the slide. This is why people believe that we will continue
to see the pounds of aluminum per vehicle to grow.

We are going into really nice new growth phase. 77 pounds
growth between 2015 to 2020, this is a 20% growth. And this is all, taking into
account today's conventionally available aluminum alloys for automotive.

Now add into it, fast forward what we have in store, the
micromill. And the micromill, the first micromill applications, we target
clearly at the automotive market. And when you look at what capabilities the
micromill material has, the micromill material has the capability to add to
this incremental 250 pounds per vehicle, by attacking what today is squarely
reserved for steel.

Why? Because micromill material is 2 times more formable,
30% lighter, and absorbs 40% more energy. So this is a good picture, and
another market where the market looks interesting in North America, I filled
you in on this. On top of it, the penetration is going to go, and Arconic will
benefit from that. So much about Arconic.

Let's now talk about Alcoa Corporation, previously our Alcoa
upstream businesses, right? And let me highlight one of the businesses, a very,
very fine business, the bauxite business. We are number one bauxite miner in
the world. We mine 45.3 million tons, right? The market, just to give you an
idea for, is 290 million tons.

And when you look at the tons here, our tons are next to
major markets, and we have growth opportunities. Plus, we have a very good
knowledge about refining, as well as multi-product solution for customers. What
that means is, we know how to fine-tune the bauxite to the refinery that it
goes to, like nobody else does, because we run a lot of refineries. And that's
a big, big plus when you enter the third-party bauxite market as we have done
it.

We believe the third-party bauxite market -- you see it
here, up on the upper right hand side, it's going to double in the next 10
years, an annual growth rate of roughly 7%. And we have been really successful
since we started this business, a really strong start, and increasing our
third-party bauxite business. With $60 million contracts signed in the second
quarter, in total our third-party bauxite sales stand at around $410 million,
and those contracts stretch over 2016 and 2017.

We have shipped the first Western Australian bauxite as a
trial cargo to China, and they are going through the evaluation. But one thing
that I'm particularly happy about, our Juruti mine, our Brazilian Juruti mine
is it will be exporting 1 million tons to China in 2016. And that's roughly out
of the 5 million that will get produced there, right?

And you see it reflected also in the higher profitability.
So this team has done an unbelievably good job. I mean, really fantastic,
fantastic, and, again, also here, like in many of the other segments, more to
come.

So this is true by the way for many Alcoans. When you look
at the productivity that we have been able to generate in the first half, $739
million in productivity. And when you then look at us, you know we have the
degrees of implementation, action sheet system, we have 18,000 ideas in the
system which lead to future improvement. So this is why we feel so comfortable
in continuing to have productivity increases also going forward.

It's broken down in productivity, where we have roughly
16,000 action sheet growth. 1,800 in asset management, roughly 600. So the
productivity is well on track and ahead of our targets.

When you look at future Arconic, $360 million. When you look
at future Alcoa Corporation, $379 million. Very, very good job here.

So with this, let me also talk a second about the separation.
Lastly, the separation is going as planned. We have just filed, it seems like
yesterday, but it's 10 days ago roughly, our initial Form 10. We are on course
to separate the Company in the second half of this year.

So let me summarize. We are increasing, continuing to
improve our results. Arconic is gearing for profitable growth in aero, auto,
and other interesting businesses. Alcoa Corporation benefits greatly from a
more competitive portfolio. We brought the cost position down, and has a
leading bauxite position. Both companies are strengthened with $1.9 billion
on-hand, and the separation is on track for the second half of this year. So
with this, let's open the line.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

Your first question comes from Andrew Quail with Goldman
Sachs. Your line is open.

ANDREW QUAIL, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Yes, good afternoon,
Klaus and Bill. Thanks very much for the update, and congratulations on a very
strong quarter. Just a couple of questions. One is on your aero guidance. Just
want to know if it's all volume related, or does it reflect some change in
pricing? And two, would your combined 2016, 2017 expectations at the start of
the year be the same as they were, or has all the growth been pushed into 2017?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Let me start with the second one. The
growth has not been pushed into the second year. It is, as I explained it, I
mean, and you hear it not just from us, I mean from everybody, and you will
hear more in the next days in Farnborough. I mean, there were some well-known
early technical issues, and they are kind of normal when you do these type of
enormous innovations, particularly on the jet engine side. And that's why the
producers went very, very slow, with a very slow ramp-up. But these problems are
solved, and now really it's about executing to fill the orders.

And so, the whole supply chain is really ramping up now on
the jet engine side. On the structured side, that's why I differentiated, on
the structured side, structured side is a bit different because there is a
near-term destocking going on, right? So that's why we have the guidance as it
is. And on the pricing side, you can actually see it that, yes, there will
continue to be pricing pressures in the market because people really have to make
sure that they are more competitive. We assume that and, therefore, we continue
to have productivity in this, and come out with solutions that are more
innovative, so that our customers are more competitive.

ANDREW QUAIL: Thanks very much, Klaus. One more. Just on the
pension, just wondering if with the split in the second half, do you guys have
to mark-to-market the pension at all?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: We will when we perform the split. So the
underfunded status will be updated at the date of the separation.

ANDREW QUAIL: And do you guys give any guidance on the
assets? I know in the K, you've obviously given some good guidance on the
liabilities. Do you give any guidance on the asset sensitivity?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: We do. And it's in the K, and it's -- if I
quote it without looking at it in the K, I'll probably get it wrong, but it was
something like a 0.25 point, on both pension and OPEB was around $450 million
is my recollection.

ANDREW QUAIL: For the assets?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Yes. Go look in the K.

ANDREW QUAIL: Okay, I will. Thanks, Bill. All right. Thanks,
guys.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Thank you, Andrew.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Evan Kurtz with
Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

EVAN KURTZ, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hi. Good afternoon,
Klaus and Bill.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Hello, Evan.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Hey, Evan.

EVAN KURTZ: I have another question on EPS business. If I
take your full year guidance kind of triangulate with the 5% to 10% for the
third quarter, it implies -- it depends how you run the math -- but I'd say
kind of a minimum of 30% ATOI growth in the fourth quarter. And I realize the
comps are pretty easy, given the low numbers from last year. But I was
wondering that, given the magnitude of that growth, how much of that is just
aluminum price behavior versus what it was last year, versus a recovery in the
structural inventory issue?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: On the EPS side, you will see very, very
little aluminum price aspects, I mean, so that's really not in there. And I
mean, as I said before, there is a ramp-up curve that we are seeing in the
second half. We saw actually a very difficult first half, already starting with
December last year, right? This seems to be over. This is ramping up, and we
are on track to meet our targets, and you've seen that, the second half. We
believe that particularly on the jet engine side, we are seeing already -- we
are seeing already, a very strong demand coming in. We saw it already in the
June days.

EVAN KURTZ: And is there seasonally anything that happens in
the fourth quarter, because it was pretty weak in 2015 and 2014 as well? Or is
that just coincidence?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: I think that this year is going to be
different. This year is going to be different because you, as I commented, you
have this transition year. And we had, for instance, I mean, the Airbus saying,
that they have I think 25 A320s that they have fully manufactured, but they are
without the engines. So they are waiting for the engines to be delivered, so
they can then also ship them over to their customers. So this is what's going
on there.

So I think that you could not -- you cannot draw conclusions
from the past. This is a very, very different, and a bit of an off year because
of the enormous amount of innovation that's going on. And the innovation
actually is the foundation why there is such a strong demand. I mean, when you
see the new jet engines getting 15% on average, 15% of efficiency improvement,
that's something.

EVAN KURTZ: Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just
maybe one follow-up, if I may.

Boeing had an announcement out a couple weeks ago that
they're changing a lot of their payment terms and inventory management. And we
did see, a working capital injection, a pretty large magnitude in the first
quarter. I was wondering if that is actually tied to Boeing's new stance on, I
guess, basically forcing their customers to manage working capital for them? Is
that already in your numbers, or is that something that we may see in the
future?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: We've seen that already in the second
quarter. If we look at working capital, biggest driver on working capital
year-over-year is the acquisition of RTI, now known as ATEP. But we've also
seen some creep up in working capital, and one of the reasons is because of
some of the moves that our customers are making.

EVAN KURTZ: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Thank you, Evan.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from David Gagliano with
BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.

DAVID GAGLIANO, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: Hi, great. Thank
you for taking my questions.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Hi, David.

DAVID GAGLIANO: Hi. I just have a couple of number questions
on slides 13 and 14. It looks like there's in the ATOI bridges for the alumina,
and primary aluminum segment, there's about $20 million of portfolio actions
included in the bridge. I'm wondering what is that? And secondly, is that
included in sort of that 3Q outlook commentary that you mentioned?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Yes, the 3Q -- whenever we give 3Q
commentary, it's always in the upstream business, it's always on a sequential
quarter basis. And it uses a base, as everything excluding price and currency
impacts. So the positive that we got out of portfolio actions in the second
quarter, in the alumina business, in part was the curtailment of Point Comfort.
And then on the smelting business, the portfolio action that the -- the biggest
portfolio action there, is the curtailment of Warrick. So both of those are
curtailed. And so, yes, it would build upon the favorability that we see in those
segments.

DAVID GAGLIANO: All right, makes sense. And then, just one
other clarification question. On slide 26, the EPS third-party revenue targets
for 2016, the bottom right corner, looks like the EPS one went down about $100
million. It says it's from the medical sale, although the revenue in that
business is only $70 million, at least it was for the year pro forma. So that
would imply like $30 million of that $100 million. Is there anything else going
on in that haircut to the -- or in that reduction, I guess, better way to say
it?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: No. No, the actual numbers, and I think
Klaus had it on his presentation, the reduction associated with Remmele was $55
million in revenue. And you may say, well, why is that $55 million different
than the $70 million? But that $55 million was accounting for the fact that it
was a year-over-year versus when we had owned them part of the year. So that
$55 million has been backed out of the target.

DAVID GAGLIANO: Okay. So then, I still am trying to understand
one of the questions Evan asked a minute ago. It's not quite as onerous, in
terms of the growth rates in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter when
you adjust for that, but it still implies growth. And yet, versus last quarter,
it looks to me like the only thing that's really changed in the outlook
commentary was a pretty steep reduction in the global aerospace growth rate
expectations from 68% to kind of flattish. So essentially, what I'm wondering
is, why haven't you cut the guidance for the EPS segment for the year, given
the change in the outlook?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Because we are seeing that this is ramping
up. This is ramping up, and because we have taken pretty severe actions also on
the productivity side in the first part of the year, when we weren't quite sure
what was going on there. And you've seen that in the restructuring that we've
done on the EPS side. I mean, I would say, roughly about 1,000 people that we
have taken out, or taken out, or moved to low cost, a pretty big move to low cost
countries, right? So all of this is what we have done.

DAVID GAGLIANO: Okay.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: And we're working hard to get the ramp-up
done so. But that's a better problem to have.

DAVID GAGLIANO: Okay. All right. Great. That's helpful.
Thank you. I don't mean to pick on numbers when -- No, no, it's fine. It's
actually a very good quarter. I should have said that in the beginning.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Thank you, David.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Exactly, David. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Jorge
Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

JORGE BERISTAIN, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Hey, guys, it's
Jorge with DB. Just again, congrats on a solid quarter, especially in the
upstream. I did want to talk a bit more about ATOI, specifically in engineered
products. So again, on page 11 of your PowerPoint, where you are giving us kind
of that sequential bridge as to what happened year-on-year in the quarter. It
would seem that again you're facing pretty big headwinds on what you're calling
price/mix, and it's down $40 million year-on-year, and it was down $30 million
year-on-year in the first quarter.

So what I'm trying to understand is, this what you're
alluding to when you're talking about the structure being weak? And is this
where you're seeing some kind of price concessions that had to be given to the
OEMs on your legacy business? That's my first question.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: No, that's not on the legacy business. It's
basically related to the business that is coming, the new business that's
coming, right? And frankly, I mean, it's better to be on a platform than not to
be on a platform. And you've seen also in the slides that I had in my deck, I
mean, how successful we have been to expand our base on the structures, as well
as on the jet engine side. And we, I think we addressed that also in the last
quarter. And so, that's what's happening there.

And part of it I would say, is a normal, it's a normalcy in
the market, everybody has to come down, right? And we have to make sure that we
will continue to deliver productivity. Or have innovation and innovative
solutions as we do, right, that customers are willing to pay a premium for. And
so, these are the two levers that we have in our hands, and I think we continue
to use them.

JORGE BERISTAIN: Okay. And then, the second question I had
was on cost increases, and I'm trying to understand how your pricing works in
this division? I would assume it would more or less be on a cost plus type of
formula, but can you kind of quantify what type of cost increases you're facing
there, that you're not able to pass on to clients?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: It does not work on a cost plus basis. I
mean, so simple labor cost increases, you can not, you can absolutely not count
on. And it, I mean, it's not a cost plus environment at all.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: So in that category, just to be clear, we
bifurcated two sets of cost increases in the EPS business. The first is
associated with the growth projects. I talked a little bit about that in my
prepared remarks, a tremendous ramp-up in the large structural castings
business in LaPorte that we're spending some money there. We're also spending
money to reposition the portfolio down into lower cost countries like Mexico,
especially in our fasteners business. The additional cost increases that you
see there, $18 million, some higher maintenance spend. And as Klaus said, as
Klaus alluded to, labor and benefit spend but very, very, well offset. I have
to give credit to the business, that they've taken tremendous amount of
productivity actions, and $53 million of after-tax impact year-over-year on
strong productivity.

JORGE BERISTAIN: Okay. And given that you said that these
are concessions, going back to the price/mix category, these should be
well-known. Could you give us any kind of guidance into the second half as to
how -- when this category kind of lapses, or is this going to be a continual
cost pressure that you're under, given even existing contracts where it sounds
like you're having to give up some price?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Look, I mean, we give you guidance on where
we come out, and there's a lot of elements that go into it, right so?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: That's a very good answer. I mean,
ultimately, Jorge, if you go back and look at the third quarter of last year,
the guidance that we're providing is 5% to 10%. That's baked in everything we
know about the markets and pricing, and so that's the guidance that we provide.

JORGE BERISTAIN: Okay. Thanks, guys.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Okay. Thank you, Jorge.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Timna Tanners with
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.

TIMNA TANNERS, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Hi, good
afternoon.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Hello, Timna.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Hi, Timna.

TIMNA TANNERS: Hello, it was nice to see the jet engine details,
so thanks for that. We wanted to ask two questions, one on the benefit from
bauxite sales? So trying to understand, is this just some temporary
opportunistic move to increase bauxite sales, given China's greater alumina
needs and consumption there, or is this something you think would be more
permanent? And then, if it is, are you going to help us model it going forward?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Okay, Timna --

WILLIAM OPLINGER: I'll take the second one.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: The first one, the answer is very simple,
yes, this is permanent.

TIMNA TANNERS: Yes.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: I mean, permanent is a big word, Timna. But
I think it's certainly something -- and certainly when used in conjunction with
China, and then you suddenly get into a different time frame. But this -- China
does not have enough bauxite, and China has been -- as long as I know importing
bauxite. They are now these days importing 40% of the bauxite. They have been
pretty substantially surprised by some of their major bauxite resources being
shut. I mean, the Indonesians that had become a very strong supplier of
bauxite, the Indonesian government decided to have a ban on bauxite, bauxite
exports, and the ban continues to hold.

Then the Chinese moved over to Malaysia, and suddenly you
saw in the last one and-a-half years, Malaysia playing a larger part in their
imports. And here we go, the Malaysian government for good reasons also decided
we're not going to let anybody just export our bauxite, and leave behind very
often kind of structurals -- that illegal mines leave behind landscapes that
can never been vegetated again. I mean, so they put out a mining bauxite mining
ban, and the ban continues. So it was just recently renewed.

So what China Inc. has done basically, as they need the
bauxite, they have very strongly reached out to those that can provide a more
stable supply of quality bauxite. So we've seen that now Guinea has started to
fill in a strong role here. So there's quite a bit of bauxite to China coming
from Guinea. But it's also interesting that we have been able to secure
contracts from Brazil. And Brazil, last time we looked on the map is not the
closest to China. So this is all good signs, and this will continue for a long
time. And as I also said, I mean, we shipped the first Western Australian
bauxite as a trial cargo to China. They will trial it in their refinery, and
then we'll see what we can make out of this.

And recall, we have about a year and-a-half ago, when we
changed our organizational structure of what was called GPP into different
businesses, that's when we formed the bauxite business, and very actively put a
team in there to explore also third-party bauxite sales. This is there to stay,
and this is there to be more enjoyed going forward. That's my view.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: And Timna, we, in the Form 10, we had the
bauxite segment broken out. As Klaus said, going forward, Alcoa Corp currently
has six segments, and the bauxite and mining segment will be one of them. So
you get good detail in that. And you may be wondering when will you see that
again? When we have the amended version of the Form 10, after we get the
initial round of SEC comments, we will provide an amended version, and we will
have the second quarter segment results for Alcoa Corporation in there.

TIMNA TANNERS: Got you. That would be great. And on the flip
side where, an area that still continues to be a challenge, on Global Rolled
Products. I'm just fascinated about that growth in auto, 50% year-over-year,
and yet the ATOI guidance being where it is, and I know that packaging has been
a drag.

So I guess, I just want to take a step back, and ask what's
the outlook for packaging? When can we see your next results not -- what time
frame would we not see that negative comment on packaging? When can that
stabilize, do you think, or what is the outlook for that industry longer term?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: That's a very good point, Timna. You may
remember that we decided for North American packaging, that North American
packaging will be part of future Alcoa Corporation, and will not be in Arconic.
And there is a host of reasons for it. But one reason is that this business has
turned into a more commodity like characteristic. So unfortunately, the
pressures on packaging will continue, it will continue. There is a bit of an
oversupply in the market, so we will continue to see it.

At the same time, we have taken strong actions also, because
part of this move is that Tennessee is going basically leaving the segment, and
is entirely -- as you may also remember, we refocused Tennessee which used to
be just a packaging mill, and expanded it into becoming an automotive mill. The
automotive mill is ramping up, and it's one of the big reasons why you are
seeing these increases, also in automotive. And Tennessee will eventually not
manufacture for packaging.

And we will also use the mill in Saudi Arabia, the mill that
we built there, which is very, very good and very modern mill, but currently
has too few contracts, and is very well able to do packaging material. We will
use that to supply to the US market. And that's basically the setup that Alcoa
Corporation has, a much more competitive set-up to play strong and good, and
less costly structure in the packaging market in North America.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Couldn't agree more. We're excited to have
it in Alcoa Corporation, and looking forward to making it a successful
business.

TIMNA TANNERS: Okay. Great. I'll follow up offline. Thanks.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Okay, Timna, thank you.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from David Lipschitz with
CLSA. Your line is open.

DAVID LIPSCHITZ, ANALYST, CLSA: Good evening, guys.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Hey, Dave.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Hi, Dave.

DAVID LIPSCHITZ: Quick question. In terms of the Primary
Metals, you said $35 to $40 impact from the alumina, is that included in the
guidance, or is that part of the pricing impacts?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: That's part of the pricing impacts, Dave.
All the LME, API, both input costs and output pricing are excluded from the
guidance.

DAVID LIPSCHITZ: Okay, just wanted to make sure. And then,
secondly, I don't know if you're going to be able to answer this. Can you tell
me -- because I know you broke it out in the Form 10, and I know we'll get it
in the new Form 10, what the actual alumina realization price was in the
quarter, excluding the bauxite stuff?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: The bauxite -- I don't have the alumina
realization price, but the bauxite sales were roughly $87 million in the
quarter. So that should help you, be able to model out what the alumina
realizations were.

DAVID LIPSCHITZ: Okay. And then, in terms of how you do it
-- when you do it internal versus external, is it the same market price, or do
you -- are you able to sell the external stuff at a higher price than you would
sell it to yourself?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: There occasionally may be somewhat of a
timing difference, but in the end, we try to make sure that internal and
external pricing is done at arm's length and match very, very closely. So they
should be very similar, Dave.

DAVID LIPSCHITZ: Okay. Thank you.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Thank you, Dave.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Justin Bergner with
Gabelli & Company. Your line is open.

JUSTIN BERGNER, ANALYST, GABELLI & COMPANY: Good
afternoon.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Good afternoon, Justin.

JUSTIN BERGNER: Most of my questions have been taken, but I
did have one or two still.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Go ahead.

JUSTIN BERGNER: On the asset sale proceeds, are those
pre-tax or post tax numbers? And does any of the increased asset sales change
or change on the margin any of the proposed capital structure comments that
were made recently on the separation call?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Yes. So the proceeds that we've given you
are cash proceeds. So they're our best estimate of cash, and that would be post
tax proceeds. And clearly, the reason why we're doing the nonessential asset
sale program is to improve the overall balance sheet of Alcoa Inc., and that
will improve the, ultimately the balance sheet of Arconic, once Alcoa
Corporation is spun out.

So the capital structure comments that we made to you 10
days ago still stand. And that is, we would be looking to raise approximately
$1 billion of debt in Alcoa Corporation, and we would be picking up roughly
$2.6 billion of pension and OPEB liabilities in Alcoa Corporation.

JUSTIN BERGNER: Great. Thanks for the clarity. My other
quick question was in regards to the Engineered Products and Solutions segment
and the $40 million price mix headwind, I mean, should we expect a similar
price mix headwind in the second half of the year on a quarter by quarter basis?
Or will that price mix headwind be coming down from the second quarter levels?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Yes, Jorge asked the same question already,
so, and let me answer it again. I mean, so the thing is, as I said before, the
pricing pressures will continue to be there, and we have to compensate this
with productivity as we will, as we have, and you've seen how much more is in
store there. Or with innovation that the customer is willing to pay more for
it, and we've also done that, right?

So at the same time, we are not providing particular
guidance on pricing. We have a guidance on the third quarter, and we have a
guidance on the full year. And as I said, we confirm to that.

JUSTIN BERGNER: Great. Thanks for the extra clarity.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Thank you, Justin.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Okay. Next question, please.

OPERATOR: Your last question comes from the line of Tony
Rizzuto with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.

TONY RIZZUTO, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Well, at least I
got on here. Hey, Klaus.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Hey, Tony.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Hey, Tony.

TONY RIZZUTO: I've got a couple questions. With all the
discussion about the competitive pressures on the structure side, I'm just
wondering how has the competitive dynamic changed with Precision Cast Parts now
a private Company?

MATTHEW GARTH: That's a good question, and that's a really
good question. I mean, the -- unfortunately, Berkshire Hathaway has decided to
not show the separate numbers for PCC. So it was always a good benchmark for
some of the EPS businesses, but unfortunately, we are not getting that anymore.
And the rest, pretty much is there to come.

You've seen how successful we have been in gaining more
share. We have strengthened our position substantially, and we will continue to
strengthen it. And also through innovations that are further out, like what we
are currently doing on the 3D-printing metals powder, as well as the Ampliforge
and other things that we have in store. So competition, I believe is a good
thing. So we forge ahead.

TONY RIZZUTO: All right. That's helpful. It's a tough one
for us to understand, obviously (multiple speakers).

And my other question is on the asset sales. You guys refer
to the $1.2 billion during 2016. You've already received $815 million
year-to-date, and you've already announced another $400 million in the second
quarter. So that target, it sounds to me to be somewhat conservative. Are there
other nonessential assets that you may be targeting?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Well, look, I mean, I think we are all here
in it together because we want to increase the value for the shareholder,
right? I have always believed -- I mean, talking about things in theory going
forward is not helpful on this. And so, I think Bill has described it very,
very well, in saying this is what we have been able to execute up to now,
right? And all of these assets, as you clearly can see, are nonessential
assets, right? So, and they help us tremendously in strengthening our balance
sheet.

TONY RIZZUTO: Understand. You'd rather talk about these when
you've got them in your pocket type of thing. Certainly, understand that. Thank
you very much.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Thanks, Tony.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Good talking to you. Okay, I think that
gets us to the end here. So let me just summarize. We will continue to improve
the performance of our businesses as you see, and we have been making Alcoa
more agile. We saw the profits in this quarter up at Arconic. We saw upstream
performing, even though it is a low pricing environment.

We will continue to be laser-beam focused on all these
things that we can control, like productivity, like monetizing nonessential
assets, focus on cash, strengthening our balance sheet, drive profitable
growth, using also as using innovation for it. And the good news is, separation
is on track. And I will be rushing now to the airport to make it over to
Farnborough to meet with a lot of our customers, and to get another good dose
of what is going on in the market.

And what I'm most excited about, I will also see a lot of
Alcoa/Arconic material in the air. I mean, just to mention, first will be the
Joint Strike Fighters will be there. They will be flying, and I'm very much
looking forward to it. The A320neo, the 737 MAX, the Bombardier C Series CS100,
and another first, the Embraer Air E2, also first time there. So that is
exciting, and we will keep you in the loop with all the good things that are
happening. Thank you very much, and talk to you soon.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the
first-quarter 2016 Alcoa earnings conference call. My name is Shannon, and I
will be your operator for today. As a reminder, today's conference is being
recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to
your host for today, Matthew Garth, Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis,
and Investor Relations. Please proceed.

MATTHEW GARTH, VP OF FINANCIAL PLANNING AND ANALYSIS &
IR, ALCOA INC.: Thank you, Shannon. Good afternoon, and welcome to Alcoa's
first-quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

Let me begin by apologizing for the late distribution of the
press release. Our news wire provider network went down, so we distributed the
release as quickly as we could. I'm joined today by Klaus Kleinfeld, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer; and William Oplinger, Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer. After comments by Klaus and Bill, we will take your
questions.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's
discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events
and expectations. You can find factors that cause the Company's actual results
to differ materially from these projections listed in today's press release and
presentation, and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we have included
some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most
directly-comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press
release, in the appendix to today's presentation, and on our website at 

 under the "Invest"
section. Any reference in our discussion today to historical EBITDA means
adjusted EBITDA, from which we have provided reconciliations and calculations
in the appendix. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Klaus.

KLAUS KLEINFELD, CHAIRMAN & CEO, ALCOA INC.: Very good,
Matt. Thank you very much. In the usual fashion, let me characterize the
quarter. Solid performance, strong productivity, separation on track. We have,
for your better digestion actually, separated out your Arconic, as the new
value-add company will be called, and new Alcoa, gives you a better taste for
the future two firms.

Let's start with the Arconic segment. Revenue is $3.3
billion, down 2.2% overall. This is really a combination of the growth of 6.7%,
predominantly acquisition related, and a decline of 8.3% from metals and FX
changes, and also minus 0.6% from divestitures or closing of operations.
Profits are up 8%, record adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.4%.

If we then go down into the segments, global rolled products
profit up 26%, the EBITDA margin per metric ton, probably the best measure of
how they're doing, $374. And if you include the Warrick metal, cold metal plant
it would have been even at $390 per metric ton.

And then in Engineered Products and Solutions, record
first-quarter revenues, record first-quarter profit up 4%, transportation and
construction solutions up 3% profitability, and record first-quarter adjusted
EBITDA margin of 14.9%. Good news, also, we've been able to secure a supply
agreement with Airbus for 3D printed titanium parts for Airbus on the planes.
So this is obviously also indicating an important future business opportunity.

We've been able to secure multi-year $1 billion industrial
gas turbine contract, the largest IGT contract to date. We have been able to
sell Remmele Medical, proceeds of $102 million. $179 million of productivity,
plan is $650 million in 2016. Global rolled products, transportation,
construction solutions are on track to meet their three-year targets, and we
have set a new goal for EPS that will better reflect the aerospace market and
the Firth Rixson performance, and obviously we'll go into it and I'll talk to
this in detail in my presentation.

So then, when you go to the new Alcoa segments, third-party
revenues of $1.7 billion, down 32%. This also is a combination of growth of
4.5%, offset by 26% through lower prices and FX, and another 10.6% through the
curtailment and closures of operations. Both segments are profitable. We've
been able to sign a $350 million third-party bauxite contract.

Ma'aden, the refinery is now at 80%, nameplate capacity,
we've been able to curtail, fully curtail. We are able to fully curtail Point
Comfort by the second quarter. Warrick smelter is closed, $175 million of
productivity, plan is $550 million in 2016.

We've sold the pipeline, natural gas pipeline, or our stake
in it, in Western Australia, for $154 million, and we are on track to meet our
three-year targets, which is a cost curve target to get down to 38th percentile
for aluminum and the 21st percentile for alumina. And as a third point,
separation is on track. With this, let me hand over, Bill, to you.

WILLIAM OPLINGER, EVP & CFO, ALCOA INC.: Thanks, Klaus.
As we usually do, let's review the income statement. First-quarter 2016 revenue
totaled $4.9 billion, down approximately 15% year-over-year. Organic growth,
and growth from the recent acquisitions was offset by lower alumina and metal
pricing, and the impact of divested and closed businesses. Cost of goods sold
percentage decreased by 230 basis points sequentially, largely due to
productivity gains.

Overhead spending increased year-over-year, primarily as a
result of costs related to planned separation of the Company, and the
acquisition of RTI. Other expenses of $34 million were related to the results
of our Ma'aden joint venture and unfavorable currency translation.
First-quarter effective tax rate of 73.2% was primarily due to non-deductible
separation costs, and tax associated with an asset sale and discrete tax items
in the quarter. Excluding these impacts, our operational rate was 32%.

Overall, net income for the quarter was $16 million or $0.00
per share. Preferred dividends were $18 million in the quarter, which reduced
EPS by $0.01 per share. Excluding special items, net income was $108 million,
or $0.07 a share.

Let's take a closer look at the special items. In the
quarter, we recorded after-tax charges of $92 million or $0.07 per share,
primarily related to restructuring and separation costs. Restructuring across
the business included accelerated depreciation of the Warrick smelter, costs
from the Wenatchee and Point Comfort curtailments, and headcount reductions
associated with lower market demand, largely in the aerospace businesses.

In the EPS segment we've reduced 600 positions in the first
quarter, and have a plan to reduce an additional 400 positions this year, also,
given the current market environment, we're evaluating a further reduction of
up to 1,000 positions. Portfolio transaction costs stem from work being done to
separate the Company. Note that roughly 75% of the restructuring-related
charges are non-cash.

Now, let's look at our performance versus a year ago.
First-quarter adjusted earnings of $108 million were down $255 million from the
prior-year quarter, driven largely by the drop in alumina and metal prices.
Lower prices, predominantly related to new contracts that have been signed over
the last year, drove a negative impact also. However, strong productivity gains
in all segments contributed $232 million in savings, which more than offset $80
million in cost increases. The largest driver of these cost increases were
costs associated with our recent exits in the upstream business, as well as
increases in labor and benefits.

Now let's move to the segment results. GRP turned in another
strong quarter, as growth in automotive sheet shipments and solid productivity
gains were partially offset by spending on growth projects and utilizing cold
metal at the Warrick facility, after the smelter shutdown. As Klaus alluded to,
EBITDA per ton was $374 a metric ton, or $390 a metric ton, excluding the costs
associated with the Warrick curtailment, well above the three-year target of
$344 a metric ton.

As we look to the second quarter of 2016, we expect GRP's
performance to reflect the following factors: Strong automotive sheet
shipments, lower commercial transportation build rates, and $15 million of
costs after-tax to secure metal as a result of the Warrick smelter curtailment.
Overall, ATOI for the segment is expected to be up 5% to 7%, excluding the
Warrick impact.

Let's move to EPS. EPS posted record revenue for the first
quarter, driven by the inclusion of RTI, now known as ATEP, Alcoa Titanium
Engineered Products. ATOI was $162 million for the quarter, up 4% versus the
prior year. ATEP contributed $17 million in ATOI, which is ahead of our
business case estimates.

Firth Rixson delivered ATOI of $11 million, and an EBITDA of
$34 million. On an operational basis, after-tax productivity gains in the
segment of $66 million more than offset cost increases of $39 million, and
growth project spend of $15 million. As I mentioned in the overall Alcoa
bridge, the unfavorable price mix is mainly in our base aerospace segments.
Klaus will spend some more time talking about the performance drivers in EPS
here shortly.

As we look to the second quarter, we expect the aerospace
market to remain solid. However, it will be tampered by declines in legacy
program deliveries, careful new program ramp-ups, and inventory management at
OEMs. We expect to gain share through innovation, and continue to drive
productivity across all businesses, amid pricing pressures. Overall, for the
second quarter, we anticipate ATOI to be up 5% to 10% year-over-year.

Now, let's move to TCS. TCS first-quarter revenue declined
9% year-over-year driven by the North American heavy duty truck market, and the
relatively weak Brazilian market. ATOI for the first quarter was $39 million,
up slightly versus the prior-year quarter, as productivity gains more than
offset currency, market headwinds, and cost increases.

As we look to the second quarter, we expect improvement in
the North American non-residential construction market, with sustained levels
in Europe. Continued softness in the North American heavy duty truck market, offset
by European improvement, continued weakness in our Brazil operations, stemming
from the current economic environment. However, the second-quarter ATOI is
expected to be flat year-over-year, as strong productivity gains counter these
factors.

Let's now move on to Alumina. Sequentially, the alumina
segment was heavily impacted by declines in API pricing, which fell another 19%
on average this quarter. Strong productivity at our operating locations, and
improved mix of smelter grade shipments priced on API helped to partially
offset these pricing headwinds. We've ramped down our Point Comfort refinery,
which is currently operating on one digester, and we will be fully curtailed in
the second quarter.

Creep production, however, with our system will offset the
Point Comfort decline, yielding flat production sequentially. As we look
forward to the second quarter, API pricing, as it usually does, will follow a
30-day lag, and LME pricing to follow a 60-day lag. Continued expansion of
third party sales of bauxite, as Klaus alluded to, we recently signed a large
bauxite contract. Benefit from acceleration of our productivity program. ATOI
is expected to be up $15 million, excluding impacts of pricing and currency.

Let me turn to Primary Metals. Primary Metals's first-quarter
ATOI improved by $54 million sequentially, due to very strong productivity
improvements, and further declines in alumina costs. The closure of the Warrick
smelter was completed in the quarter. Looking forward to the second quarter, we
expect production will decrease 50,000 metric tons, because of the Warrick
closure.

Pricing, as it usually does, will follow a 15-day lag to the
LME, and energy sales will continue to decline, but our accelerated
productivity program and favorable raw material costs will more than offset
these headwinds. In this segment, ATOI is expected to be up $10 million,
excluding the impacts of pricing and currency.

Before I move on to working capital, let me summarize the
second-quarter guidance. GRP up 5% to 7%, excluding the Warrick cold metal
plant. EPS up 5% to 10%. TCS flat in tough market conditions, and the upstream
up $25 million, excluding pricing and currency impacts.

Let's take a look at working capital. DWC increased 14 days
year-over-year. Acquisitions, mainly ATEP, drove 10 days, while the organic
business increased by 4 days. In the organic portion of the business, the
increase of 4 days is almost entirely related to the ramp-up of our automotive
sheet business and new growth programs and EPS.

We move on to the cash flow statement. Cash from operations
was negative $430 million for the quarter, leading to free cash flow of
negative $681 million. This reflects our usual seasonal increase in working
capital, as well as annual incentive compensation payments, semi-annual
interest payments, and the third of five annual DOJ and SEC settlement
payments, related to the Alba case.

This quarter, we contributed $70 million of cash to the
pension plan. One question we often get asked is whether the pension expense
sits in the segments or in corporate, so I'll take a second to clear that up.
Pension expense associated with the active employees and retirees from existing
businesses is included in the respective segment. Pension expense associated
with sold, closed businesses, or corporate employees, sits in corporate.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $251 million, with $123 million
related to return-seeking projects.

We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash. We've also
announced the sale of a few assets to increase our cash position, so let me
take a look at those in more detail. As you can see from this slide, we've
initiated the sale of non-essential assets as part of our actions to strengthen
liquidity during the separation process.

These include both upstream and future Arconic assets. We've
announced the sales of our stake, as Klaus alluded to, in the Western Australia
pipeline, and ATEP's medical device business, and have already closed on the
pipeline deal. In addition, we are redeeming the corporate owned life insurance
program which was set up a number of decades ago. Those sales generated $234
million in the first quarter, with approximately $270 million more expected in
the second quarter. So if we move to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter
with $1.4 billion in cash on hand and debt at $9.1 billion, resulting in net
debt of $7.7 billion, slightly higher than our position last year at this time.

Now let's take a look at the aluminum market fundamentals.
We're revising our 2016 global demand for aluminum from 6% to 5%, with
consumption on pace to reach 59.7 million metric tons. The slight decline in
demand is from two key markets, China and North America.

Chinese growth is being reduced to 6.5% versus our prior
forecast of 8%, due to slower growth in the construction and electrical
segments. North American demand growth is being reduced to 4%. However, at the
same time, we've seen a reduction in supply, leaving our 2016 deficit
projection largely intact. Aluminum supply growth is projected at only 2% year-over-year.
At approximately 3% supply growth, China's net supply growth rate is the lowest
that it's been since the global financial crisis.

Even outside of China, we see the majority of growth coming
from Asia, while North America has curtailed significant production, putting
the rest of the world on track for 1.5% supply growth in 2016. So the net
impact is a global deficit of aluminum of approximately 1.1 million metric
tons, with the rest of the world in deficit by nearly 2 million metric tons and
China in surplus. Global inventories on a days of consumption basis have
fallen, both year-over-year and versus last quarter, and we expect them to
continue to fall, due to the global deficit this year. Premiums seem to have
stabilized with all three of the major global premiums currently above their
low points from the fourth quarter.

We move to the alumina market. The 2016 alumina market is
also in deficit of approximately 1.4 million metric tons. However, this is a
fairly large revision from our prior estimate of 2.2 million metric tons. The
lower deficit is predominantly the result of lower demand due to smelting, as I
alluded to on the smelting side, and Chinese refinery restarts.

Similar to aluminum, alumina demand growth is projected to
outpace supply growth globally in 2016, moving the market from the 2015 surplus
to a projected deficit. The price has responded to the improving fundamentals,
recovering almost $50 per ton since the lows we experienced at the beginning of
the year. Now, let me turn it back over to Klaus.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Thank you very much, Bill. So why don't we
start with a look into the end markets that are most relevant for Arconic and
also for the new future Alcoa.

Start with aerospace. Aerospace we project 6% to 8% growth
this year. This is a little lower than our 8% to 9% that we saw for this year
earlier in the year.

We see that the market is going through a transition, given
an unprecedented level of new model introductions, and we are seeing lower
orders due to that for legacy models, and a careful ramp-up of the new models.
Large commercial aircraft deliveries stand at 9%, plus 9%. The order book, the
jet order book is bigger than nine years of production.

We actually see solid airline fundamentals from passenger
mile demand to the cargo demand, airline profitability is expected to hit a
record this year. The global trend is also fully intact with the middle class
as well as urbanization and the cancellations are below the five-year average
and below 2% of the gross order book.

Let's go to automotive, and let's start with North America.
We believe a 1% to 5% growth. This confirms our earlier view. Production was up
7.4%, strong sales, 3.1%, sustained demand also, we see the average age of the
vehicles of 12 years and older is increasing, so pent-up demand showing in
there.

Stable inventories with 65 days. The average transaction
price is up 2%. So all of that are pretty good news in that market in North
America.

In EU, automotive in EU rising production of 1.9% and the
west, 4.3% offset by minus 14% in Eastern Europe. Strong registrations, over
10%, and exports increased, expected to increase by 6.9%. China, production's
recovering, plus 3.9%. We expect for the full year, 2% to 5%, and then sales,
plus 4.1% year-to-date and minus 1.3% year-over-year.

So let's go to the next segment. The heavy duty trucks and
trailer. North America, we already had a pretty bleak outlook for this year.

And originally said minus 19 to minus 23. Looks even worse
than what we saw before. Granted, it comes off now a high base of last year. We
see minus 23 to minus 27.

Production is down 19%, weak rate growth demand, weak orders
down 42%, inventories climbing 15.6%, it now stands at 66,800. The 10-year
average is 47,400, so gives you a feel for it. The order book is falling, it
stands currently at 131,000. This is still bigger than the historic average of
101,000, which is reflective of the strength that we've seen in the previous
year there.

So Europe, we actually think that it's also a little slower,
1% to 5%. We originally thought it would be 3% to 7%. We see strength in
Western Europe, production's up 20%, registrations are up almost 22%. At the
same time, we see a decline in Eastern Europe, down 8.6%, mainly driven by the
two big markets, Russia and Turkey.

In China, sales are up 26.8%. Production's turning, slowly
turning. Remember, they had this artifact with end of 2014 with the change in
emission standards there.

So packaging, no news on all fronts. We believe North
America minus 1% to zero, Europe 1% to 2% growth, China, 5% to 8% growth.

Then on building and construction, North America 4% to 6%
growth. We see the non-residential contracts awarded at plus 4.7%.
Architectural building index relatively steady. Housing starts at 10.6 plus.

Europe we believe is going to be between zero and minus 2%,
flat to slight decline, obviously very substantially, depending on what country
in Europe you look at. China, plus 3% to 5%, we see there.

Last segment here, industrial gas turbines, we see a growth
of 2% to 4%, actually stabilizing, strongly driven by the new high efficient
turbines, with advanced technology. Heavy duty gas turbine orders are up 12%,
that's pretty nice. And the 60 hertz gas-fired generation market is up 18.5%,
also strong demand for spares and component upgrades. So that actually
concludes the part of the end markets.

So let's now go over to look at the business side, and let's
start with what we call future Arconic, or value-add businesses. Let's talk
about the first-quarter performance and the outlook for the second quarter, and
then for full year. This is a very unique year, because usually, as you know,
we don't give a full-year guidance at this time of the year, but this is the
final year of this time's three-year target, so we put this in here to give you
an overview on that.

So on GRP, to start with the first one, order shipments up
38%, strong productivity. You can see the mix is changing in the portfolio. We
also believe in the second quarter that the profitability is going to be up 5%
to 7% year over year, and we are confirming our target which is $6 billion to
$6.2 billion of revenues, and $344 per metric ton of profitability.

On TCS, we have seen a record first quarter with an EBITDA
margin of 14.9%, in spite of the headwinds, obviously that our wheels business
has been facing through the heavy duty trucks and trailer business, that I just
mentioned. Very, very good performance. Our outlook for the second quarter is
pretty much, because of that, flat year-over-year, and we are confirming the target
of $2 billion to $2.2 billion revenues, and a 15% return on that.

EPS, we have seen a record first quarter. We've seen an
EBITDA margin of 21%, and we will see more about ATEP or former RTI that's
ahead of what we planned, and Firth Rixson is progressing but behind, and I'll
talk more about this in depth. We are, as the second quarter outlook, saying
this is going to be up 5% to 10%.

As you remember, our three-year target was at $7.2 billion
revenues, with a 23%. We are lowering this target and putting out a new goal,
and our goal in depth into this, to explain what the situation is there, and
the new goal is $6 billion to $6.2 billion in revenues and profitability
between 21% to 22%. So let's give you more details, so that you can reconcile
the old to the new target.

And I would actually encourage everybody who has a chance to
look at the slides, to look at the slides, so that you can actually follow
these buckets in the best possible way, right? Because I think you want to
understand what's really going on there. So let's start here on the revenue
side. On the revenue side, we're coming down from $7.2 billion to $6 billion to
$6.2 billion.

We already said at Investor Day, compared to when we put the
target up, the exchange rate has changed. That alone has an impact on the
revenue of roughly $200 million. Then comes the aero industry headwinds that
we've seen here, and that is an impact of roughly $500 million.

The non-aero headwinds, which is mainly the off-highway
segment and the mining segment here, as well as oil and gas, adds another $200
million revenue headwinds. Then the lower performance of Firth Rixson, another
$300 million, and there's a positive one of $200 million of share gains. That
pretty much explains why we have set this target, and what has been happening
in there.

Let's now to go to the right hand side, and do exactly the
same thing on the profitability side, so on the EBITDA side. So you've seen
what we're doing on the right-hand side, what this shows here, is what are we
planning to do to get to the new target which is 1.260 to 1.360 which is
basically the amount in between 21% and 22%. So we're focusing on those things
that we can control very strongly.

So productivity, we expect to have at $400 million. Then we
have counter position to that, which is cost increases of $280 million. But if
you look at the character of these cost increases, this is not all bad because
quite -- the majority of that really is costs that are either ramped up costs
for organic growth, like our aluminum lithium facility in Lafayette, or the
move to low-cost countries where we basically invest in bringing this over
there, and will substantially reduce our costs going forward here.

Then competitive pricing, that also shouldn't be a surprise.
You know how the customers are beating down on everybody in the aerospace
industry. At the same time, you've seen that we have been able to win $10
billion of new contracts. We had to give about $100 million of pricing. At the
same time, beneath that, you actually see there's also already in this year a
positive part with the share gains, that we are getting there roughly $60
million, and then obviously a big positive, It's obviously more important to be
on the platform than not to be on the platform. And then, at the last point, is
we see a full year of RTI in here which we call ATEP now. We're substantially
ahead of plan, and that adds another $110 million.

So let's go to the next slide and let me address Firth
Rixson, because that's where a lot of questions obviously are coming from you
all. This is clearly behind our original expectation, and this has been
impacted by market headwinds, the press outage, and the isothermal ramp-up, and
I referred to those things already in previous conversations, but let me put
some numbers around it. But before I do that, let me update you where these
things stand.

The press is back online. And in isothermal, we are also
seeing additional demand. We're pursuing this. The qualification of the
existing contract continues. We believe that production shipments will start in
2017.

All included, that said, our 2016 revenue guidance comes
down from our plan from $1.6 billion to $1.1 billion to $1 billion, with a
margin of 14% to 16%, and an absolute EBITDA of $150 million to $170 million.
So if you now go to the yellow box here in the upper left corner, you actually
see that, and that's a bit of good news, that we are making progress here.
Because if you compare the first quarter of 2015 with the first quarter now,
you're actually seeing profitability is up from 11.6 to 14.3.

Let's also spend a minute on how do we get to this
performance, and so that we better understand what goes into achieving this
2016, this new 2016 goal. Again, the focus is on those actions that we have
full control over ourselves. So it's no surprise for you, that you see a big
chunk of that being productivity, and another chunk of this being actions by
management, like exiting unprofitable product, entering new engine platforms,
optimizing available capacity, right? At the same time, there are some
headwinds and these headwinds will remain, and we've talked about that.

So we have improved the performance, as you've seen, but we
are clearly behind. And if I were to quantify that, I'd probably say probably
by about two years behind here. So keep in mind, at the same time, the Firth
Rixson acquisition is not about a quarter or a year.

The Firth Rixson acquisition, you have to see in light of
what it is doing for Arconic. It is an important cornerstone for our aerospace
presence. It is allowing us already today to have a full product suite for the
jet engines. This has positioned us on a very different level via our jet
engine, as well as our industrial gas turbine customers.

So let's also now go and talk about another substantial
acquisition that we did last year, which is RTI, or as we call it today, ATEP.
So the integration is going very well. The performance is up, and it's ahead of
plan. If you look here on this slide, on the left hand side, this shows the
pre-acquisition EBITDA and EBITDA margin, and the margin has been around 14%.

If you now look to the right hand side, and look at the
first-quarter performance of former RTI, now ATEP, the profitability has been
increased to 18.7%. What have we done? We've been able to accelerate our
synergies. We are probably a year ahead, and we've been able to gain share. All
of this together has allowed us to overcome the market headwinds that we've
also seen here.

So therefore, we feel comfortable with our targets for this
year, that you see on the right hand side here, to basically be able to get to
17% to 19% margin and generate $135 million to $160 million of EBITDA in 2016.
Just to make this complete, our third but much smaller acquisition, TITAL, is
fully on track.

You have seen this, in this quarter, the excellent
performance of GRP. We have consistently and continued to shift to higher
margin, higher value product in GRP. One of the questions that I've been
receiving from some of you is, why don't we see more of this and faster? And I
want to provide some color, so that you see what is really going on in this.

So therefore, here on the left hand side, you see the
measure for profitability in this business is basically the conversion margin,
EBITDA per metric ton, right? And we've broken out here GRP into really two
segments, packaging and aero transportation, industrial, which is basically the
rest. You see what's been happening. A massive decline in profitability in
packaging, minus 55% in this timeframe that we've chosen here.

At the same time, as we are doing portfolio actions and
selling and closing rolling mills, as well as order ramps up, we've been able
to increase the aero transportation industrial segments, the profitability by
62%. And the good news is, and that's what you see on the right hand side, auto
will continue to grow in the coming years. So we very much push for constant
productivity, and that is what we can control, and as you know, that's much
needed in light of the headwinds.

So the good news is, if you look at the left hand side here,
at Arconic, we currently have 11,644 actions under way for this year, right?
And the actions so far have generated $179 million of productivity by the end
of the first quarter. The target is to get up to $650 million of productivity
by 2016, and I think we're well on track to do that.

The same good news is true for the future new Alcoa. Future
new Alcoa has achieved $175 million of productivity target at $550 million, and
there are 5,518 actions underway to get to that target. Also, well deployed, as
we would call it.

So let's also look at new Alcoa, our upstream business.
We're driving down the cost curve, and we're meeting the three-year targets.
Alumina curtailed Point Comfort, will be curtailed Point Comfort this quarter.

Saudi Arabia, 80% at nameplate capacity, Suralco curtailed,
good productivity, outlook up $15 million, with constant pricing and currency
for the second quarter, and we are confirming the target to come down to the
21st percentile by the end of the year on the cost curve. Aluminum, Warrick
smelter closed. Wenatchee curtailed. Record low cost per ton in Saudi Arabia,
good productivity. In the second quarter, we believe the profits will be up by
$10 million, again, assuming pricing and currency constant. And we are confirming
our cost curve target to come down to the 38th percentile by the end of the
year.

Lastly, let me update you on the separation. We are on
course for the second half of 2016. There's a lot of detailed work going into
separating a 120-year-old firm. Very exciting, but I would say the most
interesting thing for you out there has probably been the launch of our new
value-add name, and the refresh of the Alcoa brand, which we should see on page
14. There it is, for those that haven't seen that yet.

Let me summarize this. We're pulling all upstream levers.
Arconic is geared for profitable growth, substantially in aero and auto. We see
traction there, our robust business improvement programs underway, and we are
on track for the separation in the second half. So with this, I turn it over to
the Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

Your first question comes from the line of Evan Kurtz from
Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

EVAN KURTZ, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks everyone. Thanks
for taking my questions. Just a quick one on aerospace. Seems like the market
might be weakening a little bit. I was wondering how you protect yourself from
that? Do you have any minimum requirements, contracts where you get some take
or pay penalties if they dip below a certain amount in a given year?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: The contracts vary substantially, but
typically, the way this works is you get certain components on a jet engine or
on a plane platform, and then it all depends on whether -- how much this sells,
and typically if it doesn't sell, you don't get it. If it sells more, you get
more. That's really how this works.

EVAN KURTZ: Okay. So if they were to cut production
schedules more, that would be a one-for-one relative to your revenue in
aerospace, is that how to think about it?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: That's exactly how you have to think about
it. What you're seeing here is a little bit of a different phenomenon. They are
very carefully ramping up the new platforms, and that's, I think, a very
responsible behavior on their side, because there's a lot of new technology in
the jet engines, as well as in the structures, so they are carefully ramping it
up, so that they are not spreading the goods all over the planet, and then if
there are maintenance issues, they have an issue.

I see it rather than stretching out, because the demand, as
you can see by what I just talked about on the end market, demand continues to
be strong, right? You have a nine year order book. And there's almost no
cancellations and the fundamentals are strong, so that's what's happening in
the market.

EVAN KURTZ: Thanks for that. My follow-up is just on the
bauxite opportunity. Nice to see the $300 million third-party sale. What is the
-- I was hoping could you size the opportunity there. How much spare bauxite
capacity do you have? I assume with some of the refineries down, that you can
go above and beyond that, but any quantifying, that would be helpful.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: We have curtailed Point Comfort. We've
curtailed Suriname. And so any additional bauxite that we're getting out of the
system, we're selling into the third-party market. And so the size of that deal
that we just recently announced is $350 million over a couple of years, and as
we're looking to grow our third-party bauxite business.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: The nice thing is with the mining, it's
much easier to increase your capacity, as well as to slow down your capacity.
This is not like in a refinery or in a smelter, where you have certain
increments. A smelter you basically can typically only do a half a line, in a
refinery it's a digester that's the unit that you can bring up or down.

In a bauxite mine, it's much, much easier, and you can ramp
it up and ramp it down much faster. You leave it in the air, in -- you leave it
in the ground, we're still on aerospace, you leave it in the ground, you leave
it in the ground, if there's no demand, and you bring it out. Frankly, I think
we are really not limited by our own capabilities. We have one of the largest
bauxite reserves.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: We have one of the largest bauxite
reserves, and we're the largest bauxite miner. We mine around 45 million metric
tons a year, and looking to get bigger in the third party market.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Exactly.

EVAN KURTZ: Thanks, everyone.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Curt
Woodworth from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

CURT WOODWORTH, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: First question just
on the guidance at Firth Rixson. When you look at it relative to your initial
guidance, say 18 months ago, you're off almost $190 million of EBITDA, and you
commented that you think that's -- you're two years behind your initial plans.
The question is, how much of the miss is on the isothermal piece, and then when
you say you're two years out, does that mean you still think you can hit that
initial target you outlined for the $1.6 billion of revenue, and the $350
million of EBITDA?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Well, the good news on the isothermal, we
have structured the contract in such a way that we have a performance clause in
there. This is not directly for the isothermal alone. It's for Savannah, and
that was more for practical purposes, how to calculate that. That's $130
million, if I recall that correctly. So that's a performance, that's a
performance part in the purchasing agreement, with the seller. So in case that
doesn't happen, we would not have to --

CURT WOODWORTH: That's $150 million earn-out that we --.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Exactly. So that's the good news there. The
other thing is on isothermal, as I mentioned before, it is coming up, the
qualification is underway, and we have had additional requests from customers,
which we are currently working on securing, which obviously allow us to improve
the utilization of the isothermal press. We knew from the start on that
isothermal, it's a very, very complicated technology, and that's why we did the
earn-out, because we knew there was a risk in it from the start. Again, to be
clear, the earn-out is on Savannah in total, not just on isothermal.

The question you mentioned, the second part of your
question, will we get it in two years? Frankly, after our recent experiences, I
would really leave it as I described it. We're two years behind, and I would
say we will work on it.

And the other plan, which is something that I shared with
some of you already, but let me share it here. We are planning the moment -- we
are separating the two companies. We will be coming out with new three-year or
multi-year, let me put it this way, multi-year targets.

By that time, so in the second half of the year you will
also get much more clarity on the longer term for both companies, and we will
also come out with the measurements that are more in tune with the two types of
businesses that you will be seeing, a commodity business, as well as the high
performance technology business. We have been talking to quite a number of
investors, and we're currently in the process of getting the investor matrix
lined up.

CURT WOODWORTH: As a follow-up, just on the packaging
business, you said that profitability's down about 55%. It's not clear what the
timetable is on that chart but it looks like it's --

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Timetable's very simple. It starts
basically with the year --

WILLIAM OPLINGER: 2011.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: 2011. We put the 2011 at 100%, and then you
see how it's going from there.

CURT WOODWORTH: Falling 55% roughly, in say two years. Do
you think that's a structural change? How much of that -- do you see a
bottoming, and is it a combination of say, scrap spreads narrowing and pricing
pressure, or mix, and do you think you can turn that around at all, because
it's still significant.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Looks on the chart as two years but really
it's four, because we only showed 2011 to basically early 2016.

CURT WOODWORTH: It is pretty flat the first year.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Well, yes, in the first two years. The
answer is very simple, yes, there is a structural change in the business and
that's also why we have been doing things like, for instance, changing
Tennessee, that used to be a packaging mill only, into an automotive and
packaging mill. That's why we have been restructuring some other parts, closing
some down, on our Australian mills, for instance, two Australian mills.

We sold the three mills in Europe, two in Spain, one in
France, this all goes into it. We clearly believe that there is a structural
change in the market, and we're very happy that we have been building up the
higher value businesses in there, and that's really what you can see here also.
But the unfortunate thing is the market, the packaging market has really
substantially deteriorated.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: And I would also point out, Curt, you look
at the strength of the productivity that GRP has done year over year, and
that's really an attempt to offset some of these declines in the market in
packaging.

CURT WOODWORTH: Okay. Got it. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of David
Gagliano from BMO Capital Markets.

(Operator Instructions)

DAVID GAGLIANO, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: Thank you for
taking my questions. Also, thank you for the increased visibility on the
targets in the downstream. Actually, I have a question that's related to the
other two segments. I don't know if I'm reading this correctly, but it looks to
me like you say the GRP and the TCS segments are on track to meet the
three-year targets for 2016.

And you gave revenue numbers for each of those segments in
the press release. But if I look back at the November 2015 investor day, the
revenue numbers in the press release for those two segments are about $1
billion below what they were, as of November 2015. So I'm wondering if you
could give us a similar bridge that you gave for the EPS segment, to explain
the difference.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: To be honest, I'm looking at it right now
and I'm happy to put this out in the deck. I'm not sure whether, we probably
have to run this through our legal process here. But I tell you, it's very
simple, and it ties back to what I just explained. Remember how much we have
divested and closed also in the GRP side.

What we've basically done, if you take the original target,
was nominal $7.1 billion, right? And we've divested and closed about $1.1
billion. So the target for 2013 where we put this out was roughly -- the starting
point was roughly $6 billion. And then if you look at what we have been able to
add, through all the other things here, so automotive and stuff, and look at
the LME and the FX, it brings it basically down to $6.1 billion.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: And on the TCS side, Dave, there's around
$200 million negative impact from currency, also. So the numbers that you see
on page 6, from it's probably not page 6 on your deck, but from Klaus'
presentation, have been adjusted for ForEx impacts.

DAVID GAGLIANO: Okay. And so just -- but just to clarify, on
the GRP business, the $7 billion number that was provided November 2015 was pre
--

KLAUS KLEINFELD: $7.1 billion.

DAVID GAGLIANO: $7.1 billion, was pre any divestitures?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: It was pre any divestitures and closures,
and they have eliminated on that chart the LME and FX. You also have to see the
LME pass-through part here and GRP.

DAVID GAGLIANO: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Justin
Bergner from Gabelli & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

JUSTIN BERGNER, ANALYST, GABELLI & COMPANY: Question on
the separation. Is there any update you can give us on when we can expect the
first Form 10 filing, or any update you can give us on sort of how matters are
progressing vis-a-vis pension and the PBGC?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Two things really. On the Form 10, we've
always said first half of 2016 is when we put out the -- is when we will put
out the Form 10. And we will --

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Regarding the PBGC, we've had initial
conversations, initial discussions with the PBGC. It's gone well, and we'll
update you, as we can. But the initial discussions have gone well.

JUSTIN BERGNER: Great. That's good to hear. As you divest
some of these non-core assets, is it possible to provide us a net proceeds
number, relative to that $750 million, and should we expect Alcoa to continue
to work through divesting non-core assets opportunistically in the quarters
ahead?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: We're always looking at opportunities, how
to monetize and generate value. So I think this has always been the case, if
you look also in the previous year.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: On the net proceeds side, you almost have
to go one by one. But on the pipeline, you realize that we will have a tax
impact, and also, we are a -- it's an AWAC asset, so we get our 60% share
there. On Remmele, there will be a small tax impact, and then on the corporate
owned life insurance, that will largely show up as cash this year, and we're
likely to consume a tax attribute in future years. So largely, that one will be
without tax impact this year in 2016. So the total proceeds, slightly less than
the $750 million we have for the gross.

JUSTIN BERGNER: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Tony
Rizzuto from Cowen and Co. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

TONY RIZZUTO, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Thanks for taking
my questions. My first question is, what percentage of your aero business is
spares or aftermarket versus OEM business?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: That's a good one. Do you know it offhand?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: I don't know it offhand, Klaus. I hate to
put a number out there without the actual numbers.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Neither would I. Neither would I.

TONY RIZZUTO: I'll follow up with you guys then offline.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Exactly, Tony.

TONY RIZZUTO: Okay. And then the second question if I may,
maybe if I could possibly ask a third question if that's all right --

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Let's start with the second before the
third.

TONY RIZZUTO: All right. With regard to GRP, it sounded like
you are seeing increased pressures on margins in the packaging market. Is that
fair? Is that a fair statement?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Just look at the slide that we just
discussed here. There's no way to deny that. At the same time, I'm not sure --
I would say, we have seen the level to come down to this level, as we have it.
So I think that -- you're talking about GRP, right, on packaging?

TONY RIZZUTO: Yes. And I'm talking about the level of
acceleration in those pressures, because I am hearing -- (multiple speakers)

KLAUS KLEINFELD: I would say this, at this point in time,
we're not seeing that increasing, but we're also not seeing it trend upward.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: I would reference you back, Tony, at least
to our short-term guidance. And so we're trying to be very clear in all of our
short-term guidance that all of our segments are trending upward, with the
exception of TCS. And so on the GRP side, we said, I think 5% to 7%
year-over-year. So even if we see additional pricing pressures, we're able to
mitigate it through good cost control.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: With regards to the spares, our good team
is just providing it, and I don't want to go into each one of the segments, but
I would say -- I would say, it varies substantially depending on which one of
the aerospace segments you are looking at, and it can go from -- I think it
also varies, if you look at by year, and I only have here in front of me one
year. So it varies, if you look at, this is 2015, if you look at 2015, it
varies from 50% in that year, some businesses, to 16%, or actually 10%, 10% in
some other businesses, right? But I would be very careful with this number,
right? Because the segment that has the 50% I think that's a very unique situation
that we had in 2015.

TONY RIZZUTO: Okay. That's helpful. May I ask a quick third
question if I may?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Sure, go ahead.

TONY RIZZUTO: Of the upstream adjusted EBITDA that you
reported, $185 million in Q1, approximately what percentage would be from power
sales?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Let us come back to you on that one, Tony.
I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I think that the -- just to give
you some color, power sales have been down on a sequential quarter basis, and
on a year-over-year basis, as we've seen the Brazilian power prices come off
fairly substantially. So I can get you that number in a minute.

TONY RIZZUTO: All right. Got it. Thank you so much,
gentlemen.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Josh
Sullivan from Sterne Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

JOSH SULLIVAN, ANALYST, STERNE, AGEE & LEACH, INC.: Just
regarding the revised EPS guidance, you talked about pricing pressures from the
OEMs. Do you think we've seen the bottom of that pressure, or just how do you
see that playing out over the next 24 months? And if you could dissect that
between maybe the legacy aircraft, and next generation aircraft?

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Look, I think that there's enormous
pressure from the OEMs. They are under pressure, through their customers. This
pressure will continue. We are assuming this pressure will continue, and we
will have to continue to build productivity in, and we will also have to
continue to win through innovation, and basically put out new cars, come out
with new ideas so it's not just giving a certain reduction on price, but coming
up with a technical solution that's superior, so that we can jointly win. And
that's I think where our technical skills come in, and we are pretty good at
that.

But the pricing pressure will continue. That's what we are
assuming, and we are in the business also to help our customers to win. So that
will be going on. You also see, we're pretty proud of having won this Airbus
contract for 3D metals printing, and in this case, it's titanium. I don't know
whether you noticed that.

As you may be aware of, also, we brought our new powder
metals plant online beginning of the year, and that allows us to do powder
very, very high quality metals powder for three different types of metal alloys,
and in the main titanium alloys, nickel alloy as well as aluminum alloys. So
this is a big, big enabler for the future growth.

JOSH SULLIVAN: Okay. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Your next question comes from the line of Charles
Bradford from Bradford research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

CHARLES BRADFORD, ANALYST, BRADFORD RESEARCH: Just a simple
question on the insurance sales. Was there a profit, and do you expect to book
a profit in the second quarter, when you finish up those sales? It may have
been in your deck. I might have missed it.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: There was no book -- no accounting gain on
those sales, Chuck. There is a lower tax basis, so we will have some tax
expense associated with it, but no book gain.

CHARLES BRADFORD: Thank you.

WILLIAM OPLINGER: And Tony, to answer Tony Rizzuto, I was
able to grab the numbers fairly quickly. Around 25% of that $185 million of
upstream EBITDA is associated with energy sales. Now, that's our energy
business unit. So that would be inclusive of energy that we're selling
externally, and internally. So it would be inclusive of energy we sell at the
Warrick facility, up in Canada, at our ownership there, and then also in
Brazil.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Next question, please.

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

Your next question comes from the line of Justine Fisher
from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

JUSTINE FISHER, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: The first question I
have is related to the pension liabilities. You had mentioned earlier in the
presentation that there are liabilities associated with operating businesses,
and then anything that's curtailed goes with -- can be left at the corporate
level, I guess, as opposed to the segment level. Does that mean that those
liabilities would potentially be offloaded to the PBGC, so if we are looking at
potential standalone for the upstream business, we can exclude -- I won't
quantify, but exclude some of the legacy liabilities that are on current
Alcoa's balance sheet?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: No, we would not be looking at offloading
any of the legacy liabilities to the PBGC. The legacy liabilities will be split
between the two companies. That's part of the activity that we're going through
now. And clearly, when we sit down with the PBGC, they have an interest in how
those get split, and the creditworthiness of the two companies. So that's part
of the exercise, but none get offloaded per se.

JUSTINE FISHER: Okay. Could you reduce or reschedule any of
the cash payments related to those liabilities, that might saddle the upstream
Company?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: We are making the minimum ERISA payments
today on those liabilities. And so, we're currently on a GAAP basis, around 74%
funded. On an ERISA basis, I believe it's in the lower 90s. But there would not
be any further reduction of payments that we could make, that we're making,
less than we're making currently.

JUSTINE FISHER: Just one last question. In this timetable on
steps to completion in the presentation, it mentions complete financing in the
second half of 2016. What financing is that? I mean, if the debt can move
downstream and you guys haven't announced anything, but if hypothetically it
did, it seems to me there wouldn't necessarily need to be any new financing.
Can you talk about what that refers to?

WILLIAM OPLINGER: Sure. We would be looking, the debt
ultimately will be attributed to the upstream and the downstream. In order to
do that, we will go out and without getting into too much detail around the
orientation of the separation, we will go out into the market, raise debt on
one of the two entities, and then pay off debt at the other entity. And so
that's what the financing would be.

JUSTINE FISHER: Okay. Thanks very much.

OPERATOR: At this time, this is all the time we have, and
I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Klaus Kleinfeld.

KLAUS KLEINFELD: Very good. So you have seen this quarter,
our profits were up in every Arconic segment. Alumina, aluminum segment, both
profitable in a very low pricing environment. We are laser beam focused on the
things that we can control, productivity, high productivity, we showed you
this, winning major contracts, monetizing non-essential assets. You should
expect our focus continues there.

Looking ahead, we are on track to meet our three-year
targets in all businesses except EPS, and I hope I gave you also the clear
adjusted expectations to better reflect what is going on in aerospace, as well
as the lower Firth Rixson performance, and the better RTI performance that
shows you our new expectations for EPS, and those ones, and the other thing
here is separation is on track. So stay tuned.

We will obviously have many more opportunities coming up
here to talk. Thank you very much for joining us for this call. Thank you.

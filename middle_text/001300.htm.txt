Note that elements of this presentation contain
forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of
our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change based on many factors,
including changing economic and business conditions, and we ask that you
interpret them in that light.

Unless otherwise noted, the cost action plans described
herein are not final. They may be modified or even abandoned at any time. No
final decision will be taken with respect to such plans without prior
satisfaction of any applicable requirements with respect to informing,
consulting or negotiating with employees or their representatives. We identify
the principal risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance in our
annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.

This morning, we will review our financial results for the
second quarter of 2020 and share our views on the third quarter of 2020. And as
always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO,
Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, CEO &
PRESIDENT, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning,
everyone.

Let's begin on Slide 2. The second quarter was one of the
most challenging quarters Honeywell has ever faced. The widespread
repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price volatility impacted many
of our businesses and end markets. There are a number of factors beyond our
control in the current environment. We are laser-focused on the drivers of
value that we can control. In the second quarter, we made numerous investments
in newly emerging growth opportunities. We aggressively managed cost to protect
margins, and we generated very strong cash flow.

We delivered adjusted EPS of $1.26 in the quarter on sales
that were down 18% organically, consistent with the greater than 15% organic
sales decline we signaled in May. Our Phase 1 cost plans delivered
approximately $500 million of year-on-year benefit in the second quarter, and
we completed planning for a Phase 2 plan. These actions helped us protect
margins, limiting our decremental margins in the quarter to only 33%. In fact,
we were actually able to expand segment margin in 2 of our 4 segments.

Despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions, we
generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, driven by cost actions and customer
collections, resulting in adjusted free cash flow conversion of 140%. We
prudently deployed approximately $900 million of cash, primarily to dividends
and CapEx investments. We committed approximately $250 million of incremental
growth capital expenditures compared to our previous allocated budget for new
projects to accelerate our investments in Safety Products, Intelligrated and
other growth opportunities. These are high-return investments expected to
generate triple-digit IRRs.

Let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss the work we've done to
pivot our business, given the current environment and emerging customer needs.

I am proud of the quick mobilization by employees throughout
the company to rapidly innovate and provide solutions for both urgent and
long-term customer needs. To address the urgent need for PPE, we are
significantly growing our personal protective equipment business. We expanded
face mask productions and specifically our N95 and equivalent mask production
in Arizona, Rhode Island, the United Kingdom, India, the UAE and China.

In the U.K., we created a new manufacturing line capable of
producing a significant amount of masks at our Newhouse site in Scotland, which
will assist the U.K. government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as
service the European -- serve the European region. In addition to our expansion
of United States, India and China capacity, we have added capacity in the UAE,
where we've partnered with Strata Manufacturing, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi
state fund Mubadala Investment Company, to produce N95 masks.

Beyond masks and other [PP&E], we are innovating to
provide creative solutions for new areas of customer demand.

We recently announced our partnership with SAP to create a
joint cloud-based solution to improve building performance based on Honeywell
Forge and the SAP cloud platform. Building owners often need to pull data from
disparate sources that are not normalized, making it extremely difficult to
determine the true efficiency and utilization of their portfolios. The
Honeywell Forge and SAP Cloud for Real Estate solution will streamline and
combine operational and business data, enabling customers to benefit from
building performance optimization, including reduced carbon footprint and lower
energy cost as well as improved tenant experience. This will be especially
useful as buildings come back online in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and
economic crisis as building owners are expected to focus on key performance
indicators tied to enhanced occupant safety and reduced operating costs.

We have also launched an integrated set of healthy building
solutions to help building owners improve the health of their building
environments, operate more cleanly and safely, comply with social distancing
policies and help reassure occupants that it is safe to return to the
workplace.

We are partnering with pharmaceutical and biotech customers
in our Aclar healthcare packaging business to develop innovative packaging
solutions for future COVID-19 therapies and vaccines. We have launched new
bottles and vials called Aclar Edge that enable ultra-high moisture barrier
without the limitations of glass. We've also launched the Honeywell
ThermoRebellion temperature monitoring solution, which can be rapidly deployed
at the entry of a factory, airport, distribution center, stadium or other
commercial buildings to quickly and efficiently identify whether personnel
exhibit an elevated temperature using advanced infrared imaging technology and
artificial intelligence algorithms.

In Aerospace, we are helping to provide a safer and
healthier travel experience with ultraviolent cabin cleaning system. The
Honeywell UV cabin system can treat an aircraft cabin in less than 10 minutes
for just a few dollars per flight for midsized to large airline fleets,
significantly reducing certain viruses and bacteria on cabin surfaces.

I am very proud of the part we are planning to keep people
safe and healthy by providing new solutions for urgent customer needs. We
remain committed to continuing Honeywell's long legacy of innovation and we are
continuing to invest in our future in good times and bad.

We also recently formed new business units dedicated to
advancing our position in growing industries for sustainable energy and
unmanned aerial systems. Our new sustainable technology solutions business in
PMT will develop and commercialize new technologies that will help meet the growing
demand for solutions that accelerate the path to a low-carbon economy. This
includes growth opportunities in the plastic circular economy, energy storage,
gas decarbonization and renewable fuels. In Aerospace, our new unmanned aerial
systems business has continued to introduce new, innovative products for this
exciting market and recently conducted in-flight testing of sensors that will
guide urban air mobility vehicles to land without pilot intervention.

These are challenging times for all. We are rapidly
addressing our end market and customer needs through innovation and
mobilization of resources across the organization.

Finally, I'd like to make a few comments about our
commitment to diversity, inclusion and equality. Let me be clear. We'll never
tolerate racism at Honeywell. Fully embracing the principles of diversity,
inclusion and equality and treating all employees with the utmost respect are
requirements for working here. In addition, we are committed to the following
actions. We'll continue to evolve our community relations programs and
partnerships with key external organizations to promote diversity, equality and
opportunity for all. We will intensify our focus on the recruiting, retention
and development of women, veterans and minority groups. And we will continue to
rigorously enforce our code of business conduct, which makes it explicit that
there is 0 tolerance specifically for racial discrimination. We recognize that
these steps are a starting point, not an end, and we are committed to continuing
to make progress.

Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 4 to discuss our
second quarter results in more detail as well as to provide our views on the
third quarter.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS, SENIOR VP & CFO, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. As we
highlighted in our May call, the second quarter presented significant
challenges. However, we effectively managed with the strong operational
execution that our stakeholders have come to expect of us.

For the second quarter, sales declined by 18% organically as
the effects of the pandemic spread across the globe. Substantially lower sales
volumes in our most challenged end markets in Aerospace and PMT drove 280 basis
points of segment margin contraction, while we delivered strong sales and
orders growth in both our warehouse automation and PPE businesses.

Our Phase 1 cost actions delivered approximately $500
million of year-on-year benefit in the quarter, which brought us to
approximately $700 million of savings in the first half. We will discuss that
later on in the presentation.

We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, down 40%
year-over-year as we funded over $250 million of repositioning in the quarter
to drive cost savings in 2020 and into 2021. As we previewed in May,
repositioning was significantly higher than the second quarter of last year,
driving a $0.19 headwind below the line. A higher adjusted effective tax rate
resulted in a $0.06 EPS headwind compared to last year, partially offset by
$0.04 of EPS benefit due to lower share count. This quarter, EPS is adjusted to
exclude the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to our
spin-off transactions in 2018. So on a GAAP basis, our second quarter earnings
per share is $1.53. You will find a bridge of our EPS in the appendix of this
presentation.

We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow driven by strong
customer collections despite a difficult operating environment. And our
adjusted free cash flow conversion was 140%, up 40 points year-over-year. In
terms of capital deployment, we paid out $650 million in dividends. We also
invested over $225 million in capital expenditures in the quarter, up $56
million from the prior year. Our CapEx in the second quarter included the first
tranches of investments that we are making to produce N95 masks to support the
coronavirus relief efforts. Overall, this was a very challenging quarter, but
we continue to execute, managing costs and our cash flow with the discipline
and rigor you can expect from Honeywell.

Now let's turn to Slide 5, and we can discuss our segment
results. Starting with Aerospace. Sales were down 27% on an organic basis as
the steep reduction in flight hours lowered commercial aftermarket demand. And
a slowdown in original equipment build rates, in addition to the 737 MAX impact
in air transport, impacted commercial OE more broadly. Our air transport
aftermarket business was down 56% organically, and our business aviation
aftermarket business was down 50% organically in the quarter.

The declines in commercial aerospace were partially offset
by continued demand for U.S. government programs, including the F-35, F-15 and
the Orion space program, driving 7% organic growth in the Defense & Space
business. For the quarter, the Defense & Space backlog finished up double
digits, giving us confidence we'll continue to deliver growth in that business
throughout the second half of the year. Aerospace segment margins contracted
510 basis points driven by lower commercial sales volumes and business mix,
partially offset by cost actions to improve productivity.

In Honeywell Building Technologies, sales were down 17%
organically primarily driven by deferrals of product purchases in Security,
Building Management Systems and Fire and softness in Building Solutions due to
delays in the projects and energy businesses, some of which is a result of site
access constraints due to shutdowns, particularly in India and the Middle East.
Organic sales improved sequentially as the quarter progressed for the short-cycle
products businesses. HBT's segment margin expanded 50 basis points in the
second quarter driven by commercial excellence and cost actions to improve
productivity, which offset the impact of lower sales volumes.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were down
17% on an organic basis. Process Solutions sales were down 13% organically
driven by volume declines in products, including thermal solution, smart energy
and field instruments.

In UOP, sales were down 25% organically driven by declines
in gas processing, lower licensing and lower catalyst shipments due to weakness
in the oil and gas end market. As expected, we saw new orders decline
significantly in the second half -- in the second quarter as COVID-19 and the
oil price volatility led to lower bookings in HPS and UOP. However, we have not
seen a significant project cancellation to date.

Organic sales in Advanced Materials were down 18% driven by
lower automotive refrigerant volumes due to automotive plant closures,
offsetting double-digit growth in packaging and composites and electronic
materials. Fluorine products sales into the automotive end market improved
sequentially by month throughout the quarter as automotive plants began to
reopen.

PMT segment margins contracted 460 basis points in the
second quarter driven by the impact of lower sales volumes, partially offset by
cost actions to improve productivity.

Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were up
1% organically driven by more than 20% growth in Intelligrated and over 100%
growth in the respiratory and personal protective equipment space, particularly
-- partially offset by weakness in sensing and IoT, portable gas sensing and
productivity products. Orders in SPS were up approximately 90% in the second
quarter led by record high bookings of $1.2 billion in Intelligrated, up 300%
year-over-year; and over $650 million of bookings in personal protective
equipment, positioning SPS well for the second half of the year and into 2021.
SPS segment margin expanded 150 basis points in the quarter driven by
productivity, including cost actions, net of inflation and commercial
excellence.

So overall, we finished a challenging quarter with
significant top line impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we grew in
several businesses, including defense, Intelligrated and [PP&E]. And due to
prudent cost management and commercial excellence, we were able to limit
decremental margins at 33% overall and expand margins in HBT and SPS.

Now let's turn to Slide 6 to discuss our cost management actions
in more detail. We previously announced our Phase 1 cost-reduction effort which
we rapidly started implementing in the first quarter. This included curtailment
of discretionary expenses, cancellation of 2020 merit increases across the
enterprise, reduced executive and Board pay, reduced work schedules and a first
phase of targeted permanent census reductions.

During the quarter, we completed preparation of a second
phase of cost actions to expand permanent census reductions, which we also
began executing in June. The result is that we reduced fixed cost by
approximately $700 million year-over-year in the first half, which is pushing
us towards the high end of our original Phase 1 target range of $1.1 billion to
$1.3 billion. The Phase 2 actions should deliver approximately $200 million of
2020 benefit, so the combination of Phase 1 and Phase 2 is expected to reduce
cost by $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion in 2020. Our aggressive deployment of
repositioning funds, $250 million in the quarter and $325 million in the first
half, is serving us well. I do expect our fixed cost to be pressured
sequentially in the third quarter as the permanent reductions begin to replace
the benefits of the more temporary actions.

Now let's turn to Slide 7 and discuss our balance sheet and
liquidity. We exited the first quarter in an incredibly strong position on the
balance sheet, and we took additional actions during the quarter to further
bolster our financial flexibility. In the second quarter, we issued $3 billion
in long-term debt instruments with maturities in 2025, 2030 and 2050, replacing
a portion of the term loan financing which we reduced commensurately from $6
billion to $3 billion. So as to access -- we fully drew down on the remaining
term loan so as to access the liquidity of $6 billion that we had highlighted
previously.

As a result, we ended the quarter with $15.1 billion of cash
and short-term investments on the balance sheet and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio
below 1. The $15 billion of cash and short-term investments compares to only
$3.5 billion of commercial paper and $800 million of long-term debt coming due
within the next year.

As you'll recall, we substantially completed our 2020 share
repurchase commitment in the first quarter, and we were focused on liquidity
preservation in the second quarter. We deployed $650 million to dividends and
approximately $225 million to CapEx in the quarter. While being prudent on
CapEx overall, we will continue to fund growth investments in the second half,
and we expect full year CapEx to be approximately $900 million, including the
additional growth capital Darius mentioned earlier. We are committed to holding
share count approximately flat to the second quarter for the remainder of the
year at a minimum. We are open to deploying capital to share repurchases and
M&A investments in the second half of the year if attractive opportunities
become available.

On the topic of M&A, we are pleased to welcome Emily
McNeal to Honeywell this quarter as our new Senior Vice President, Corporate
Development, and Global Head of M&A, who will be responsible for
maintaining and building our robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities that
are strategically well positioned to accelerate Honeywell's growth. We are very
excited to have Emily on board.

Now let's turn to Slide 8 to discuss our segment outlook for
the quarter. The next few quarters will continue to be unpredictable, and our
visibility has limits under the current circumstances. Accordingly, we are
continuing the suspension of full year guidance until the economic environment
stabilizes and we can once again give reliable and comprehensive forecasts. We
believe it's important that we provide a level of precision that is
commensurate with our ability to forecast in the current environment. And
therefore, we will provide the same set of inputs that we provided in May. We
are closely watching several key drivers of uncertainty in the third quarter.

First and foremost, the severity of increasing COVID
infections and the potential for additional lockdowns is still very fluid and
could have significant impacts on the macroeconomic environment. The support
provided by the fiscal stimulus programs deployed in the second quarter by
governments globally will diminish in the third quarter, and additional
stimulus is uncertain, particularly in the U.S., which complicates the
visibility to true economic stability. The geopolitical environment and trade
stability also continues to be a wildcard.

From an end market perspective, dynamics in the air travel
industry, including flight hours, retirements and used serviceable materials as
well as oil price volatility and CapEx and OpEx budgets, which affect our PMT
business, are not stable yet at this point. With that said, the impact on
customer solvency and aging receivables remains a question mark as well and a
potential future risk that we're monitoring.

Together, these drivers are difficult to predict and set the
stage for challenging quarters ahead. So as best we see it, starting with
Aerospace, we expect global flight hours to remain far below pre-COVID-19
levels, which will significantly impact our commercial aftermarket business. We
do expect air transport flight hours to begin recovering from second quarter
lows though sequential improvements in commercial aftermarket sales due to
flight hour improvements may be offset by the impact of used serviceable
material and rotation of fleets.

Our commercial original equipment business will continue to
be impacted by lower air transport OEM build rates and lower business jet
demand due to the economic slowdown. We are anticipating that government
defense budgets will remain intact, and we expect continued growth in Defense
& Space. In combination, we expect Aerospace sales once again to be down
more than 25% compared to the third quarter of 2019.

Moving on to PMT. A combination of volatility in oil prices,
coupled with the uncertainty stemming from the global pandemic, has continued
to put pressure on our businesses linked to oil and gas. We have seen a
continued reduction in customer CapEx and OpEx budgets as well as project
delays and site access constraints which are impacting the engineering and
licensing business in UOP and orders in projects and automation solutions in
HPS.

We also expect ongoing headwinds for our products businesses
and process solutions, causing decline in field services -- in field devices
and thermal solutions. As we've previously discussed, we entered 2020 with a
healthy backlog of global mega projects in HPS, which was still up over 80% year-over-year
for the second quarter, and we expect these projects to continue to convert
over the next few quarters. Access to customer sites will likely remain
inconsistent, especially in high-growth regions, including India and Middle
East.

In UOP, we expect continued weakness in gas processing and
lower catalyst shipments due to lower production and refining volumes.
Additionally, we anticipate new projects will continue to push to the right,
and progress on current contracts may be delayed, resulting in continued
pressure on UOP licensing and engineering.

Within Advanced Materials, we expect that automotive
refrigerant volumes will continue to recover as auto OEM plants increase
production and capacity levels. In specialty products, we expect strong demand
for health care packaging and electronic materials. Altogether, we expect PMT
sales to be down more than 10% compared to the third quarter of 2019 driven
principally by the volatility in the oil and gas markets.

In HBT, while we do expect access to customer sites to
improve in some regions in the third quarter, the current environment of
nonresidential projects in multiple verticals have paused, and customers are
deferring nonessential spending, impacting the timing of long-cycle building
solutions projects and delaying purchases of security, building management and
fire products. We expect these dynamics to continue in the third quarter but to
improve sequentially. In addition, Darius mentioned our new healthy building
solution and our partnership with SAP for buildings, which we see as emerging
growth opportunities. We expect HBT sales to be down more than 10% compared to
the third quarter of 2019.

And finally, in SPS, the surge in commerce as governments
enact social distancing requirements has strengthened demand for our warehouse
automation business and supports continued conversion of our robust
Intelligrated backlog. Our Intelligrated orders were up over 300% in the
quarter to $1.2 billion driven by major systems bookings and Intelligrated's
backlog remains very strong, up 140% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, so we
expect this business to perform well the remainder of the year.

We are also continuing to see record-level demand for
respiratory masks and other personal protective equipment. PPE orders were up
triple digits for the second consecutive quarter, with strength in the
respiratory, head, eye, face, gloves and clothing categories. Our personal
protective equipment backlog is now also up triple digits, and our total SPS
backlog is at an all-time high

the macro conditions continue to put pressure on other SPS
businesses, including sensing and IoT, gas sensing and productivity products,
where we expect to see declines in the third quarter. Overall, we expect sales
in SPS to grow single digits compared to the third quarter of 2019, less than
7% overall, a very good result.

So while there are signs of stabilization in the macro
economy, key end markets remain challenged and economic conditions fluid. We
have both opportunities and challenges in the portfolio, but on balance, we
expect sales for the company to be down again more than 15% versus the prior
year. We expect between $125 million and $175 million of additional
repositioning charges in the third quarter to fund our cost programs. This
increase in repositioning in the second and third quarters will drive higher
repositioning cash outflows in the second half of the year, putting pressure on
our free cash flow. Additional details for our tax rate, share count and below
the line expenses are included in the appendix.

With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Darius.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Thank you, Greg. Let's wrap up on Slide
9. As we expected, this quarter proved to be very difficult. But we effectively
managed through the challenges with strong operational execution and cash
generation. We remain cautious heading into the second half of the year as
there are still many unknowns. However, our diversified portfolio and
significant balance sheet strength will continue to provide resilience in these
uncertain times.

We acted quickly and responsibly to make structural changes
to our cost base during the quarter. We funded over $250 million in
repositioning, and we identified significant additional actions to align our
cost base to the current environment in 2020 and 2021. Despite the challenging
times, we are delivering growth in several parts of the portfolio, particularly
in defense, Intelligrated and personal protective equipment. We're also
investing in growth opportunities and working hard to provide innovative
solutions for emerging customer needs.

I am proud of everyone at Honeywell who's working hard to
adapt and deliver in this challenging environment. And I'm confident we will
emerge from this crisis even stronger than ever.

With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.

MARK BENDZA: Thank you, Darius. Darius and Greg are now
available to answer your questions. Lauren, please open the line for Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question is
coming from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER & MANAGING PARTNER,
VERTICAL RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: Two from me if I could. Very clear on the cost
out, what you expect to deliver in 2020. Darius or Greg, though, given that
some of the stuff is kind of in flight over the course of the year here, just
wondering if you could give us a little bit of feel of kind of what the
carryover positive effects of this Phase 1 and Phase 2 would be as we look into
next year.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, I think we sort of provide
some guidance on that in the 60% to 70% because I think you have really 3
buckets of costs that we think about, right, which is purely temporarily, and
think about those as furloughs, which obviously are going to come back. The
second bucket is what I call semi-permanent. Those are some of our indirect
cost base which obviously are impacted, which they're not permanent in nature,
but we think some of those are going to carry over into 2021. And obviously,
permanent reductions.

So the 60% to 70% is a pretty good guide around that
includes primarily the permanent reductions and some portion of the
semi-permanent because obviously, on the indirect cost, we're not going to be
as low as we were in 2020, but we're also not going to get back to 2019 levels.
So we kind of have, think about a 50-50 or something in that kind of a split
that we approximate. That's sort of the rough guide, how to think about that.

I don't know, Greg, if you want.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: No, that's right. And again, at the
midpoint of our $1.4 billion to 1.6 billion, you can kind of use the $1.5
billion number, extrapolate that 60% to 70% from there.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think the only -- Jeff,
the only unknown is sort of timing because the permanent ones, the timing isn't
perfectly predictable, and some of it may move sooner, some of it may move
later. So I think timing element is, I would say, somewhat unpredictable, but
not sliding more than, let's say, a quarter.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes, and that will become much, much
clearer 90 days from now as we get through the third quarter.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: And second question. Just again,
trying to get a sense of what the future holds. And I totally respect you don't
want to kind of give really explicit guidance yet, but the framework here
certainly helps. You gave us SPS orders. Could you give us orders for the other
3 segments in the quarter? Just so we have kind of a feel for what you're
working with here as we look forward.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean if you think about HBT and
PMT, they were down in the teens is the way to think about it. Obviously, in
Aero, they were down mid-double digits. I mean, they were significantly down.
But I think there's -- so that's sort of -- hopefully, that gives you some color.
But I think there's a couple of really important things to remember.

Our total Honeywell backlog actually is up 3%, and even the
PMT backlog is up 2%. So obviously, orders actually kind of came in more or
less where we expected them to do. But overall, the backlog position improved,
which I think was a pretty good sign. So all in all, not as bad as we
anticipated.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with
JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Just on Aerospace. When you look out to the kind of third quarter
just profile-wise, what do you expect between OE and aftermarket? Will one be
picking up a little bit, the other decelerating? I mean, what is the -- just on
a year-over-year basis, how do we think about kind of the moving parts for
those 2 guys on the commercial side?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Maybe I'll start. I mean, just to
give you a little bit of a -- so let's kind of divide it up into the 3
segments. So it starts with Defense & Space. We expect that to grow again.
So that's been the strength for our business in Aerospace in Q2. We expect that
to continue in Q3.

When you think about OE, we actually expect it to be flat to
down versus Q2 for a couple of reasons. Number one, obviously, we had some carryover
impact from Q1 in terms of shipments. Number two is, in some segments and some
of our OEs, that we don't see the robust production rates exhibited in Q3. So
we don't see that improving. In terms of business aviation aftermarket, we
expect it to be slightly better than it was in Q2.

And then finally, in ATR, that one is the toughest to call.
And I'll tell you why, because you can't just look at flight hours. So all the
flight hours will be better. And if you think about a low to mid-70s reduction
year-over-year in Q2, we kind of estimated Q3 to be something in the, call it,
50s or something of that nature, which actually may be a little bit aggressive.
But the thing to think about here is that it's not -- there's a lead and lag
impact. And the second component, which is somewhat unknown, although we
haven't seen it, is there're going to be cannibalizations from the parked
aircraft.

So that one for us is really tough to call. And so we're
going to have to just kind of see how the quarter evolves. And that's why it's
hard for us to give precise guidance because these things are unknowns. We had
airlines adding more flights in July and August. Now we -- they've pulled back
their schedules a bit in August. So there's a lot of moving pieces here, and I
think the ATR aftermarket component is the toughest one to call.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: And sorry, when you talk about kind of
that USM, the used parts dynamic, your business is electronics. There's some
software. Obviously, you have some mechanical components. But I mean, outside
of -- putting business jets aside, just looking at the large commercial stuff,
I mean, how much of your business is even kind of exposed to that? It wouldn't
seem to me to be a material mover. Maybe by a few hundred basis points, but not
something that can really swing things around in a major way. Correct?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No, it's not -- no, I don't think it's
going to be dramatic, but I think it would be wrong to just say, well, to tie
the aftermarket performance purely to the quarter-over-quarter flight hours.
Because we do think, obviously, flight hours are going to be better in Q3
versus Q2. But I don't think it's necessarily just a pure correlation. We think
it's going to be a modest, very modest impact.

And keep in mind that we also had some orders back all the
way from Q1 that we still filled in Q2. So we had a little bit of a lead-lag
impact. So I don't think something dramatic because the natural assumption will
be, okay, well, it's going to be a lot better in Q3. The fact is we're really
not sure because we need to kind of see how things evolve in some of the
factors I talked about.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes, I don't think airlines behaviors
aren't necessarily solidified yet.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Yes. One last one, just getting at the
cost discussion in a bit of a different way. Probably in the worst quarter
hopefully that you ever see as CEO, you guys are putting up a headline
decremental of 33%. Would the goal be to, kind of on the way up, leverage at --
when things normalize, kind of leverage at the -- a number that's comfortably
above that? Would that kind of be the high-level goal?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think -- look, I mean,
33%, given the sudden kind of stop in our business, I actually view is pretty
good, given that we have aerospace exposure and oil and gas exposure. So I
think that, that's going to be respectable performance.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Which, by the way, was substantially
different than '08 and '09. The aftermarket stop here is multiples of what it
was in the '08, '09 recession, which really puts a lot of pressure on those
type of [numbers].

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: But our plan here, though, is to show
improvement from this number going forward. I don't think it's going to be
dramatically better in Q3, but we do expect modest improvement in some of the
-- in that 33%. So that's sort of how we're thinking about it.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with
Melius Research.

SCOTT REED DAVIS, FOUNDING PARTNER, CHAIRMAN, CEO &
RESEARCH ANALYST OF MULTI-INDUSTRY RESEARCH, MELIUS RESEARCH LLC: Guys, there
was a lot of fanfare around this SAP Cloud-Forge thing. And maybe you can back
up a little bit. I mean, can you help us size it a little bit? Or think about
what -- how do you get paid for it? What's the opportunity is? Maybe some early
signs around take rate? Just some color about really what the upside is in that
kind of alliance.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think it's really, really
exciting because I think Honeywell and SAP have what I call complementary
growth strategies. So this alliance, we started out in buildings, but I think
it's -- I think we have much broader opportunities.

And just to give you a perspective, clearly, the connected
buildings part was really a highlight of our Q2 in terms of our connected
enterprise. And just to give you the level of growth, we saw 26% growth in that
segment in Q2. So in this environment and given -- I think that's tremendous.
Obviously, we're on to something.

In terms of some of the growth drivers, I mean, obviously,
it's energy savings, it's security, it's a coherent interface so that building
owners or maintainers can understand what's going on. It's building occupancy
optimization. Now with the launch of healthy buildings, it's also social
distancing. It's wearing [PP&E], temperature monitoring, clean air quality,
all these elements are part of that connected buildings offering, which we're
now augmenting even more with a broader focus on kind of creating a healthy
environment for the office worker.

And the other -- maybe one last thing I'd want to add on to,
Scott, is that we're also in our HBT business, we're also reorganizing to be
much more end-market vertical-oriented. So for example, we're going to go to
the market as a set of solutions for health care or hospitals, for stadiums,
for airports, for office buildings, for data centers. So that's an evolution in
our HBT strategy, and I think we're going to -- it's going to be that much more
effective because we're going to be that much closer and more intimate with
those customers and their needs.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Makes sense. And I'll follow-up with you
on the sizing. It doesn't sound like you want to answer that part of the
questions...

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, I think I'm not ducking the
question because, frankly, we're creating the market. Whenever you create a
market, it's hard to guess at the sizing. But just our own installed base is
vast. We think that over time, this could be $1 billion business, just that's
sort of our scope. And we don't think that, that's like decades away. So we
have big hopes, and double-digit growth rates are an expectation. And the good
news about that is, even in an environment like we had in Q2, which was an
all-time worst for Honeywell, I mean, literally it was probably the worst
quarter, hopefully, I'll ever see, 26% growth gives you the kind of traction
we're gaining in this segment.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Wow, you answered the question. So just a
quick follow-up. The order growth in Intelligrated is pretty dramatic and not a
total surprise, but they're big numbers. Can you actually satisfy that demand
without incurring some extraordinary kind of costs around maybe overtime or...

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, I mean, that's -- I mean, you
heard Greg discuss this. I mean, we're aggressively investing in our CapEx...

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: And people.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: And people. So we're cutting in some
areas because we have to, but we're actually adding a lot of people in others.
So $250 million of incremental CapEx that we never had in our budgets.

And Scott, I think this is an important data point I just
want to give you, and I think it's one to remember. When we bought
Intelligrated, it was roughly $800 million to $900 million business per year.
We booked $1.2 billion this past quarter. That gives you the kind of growth
profile that we're seeing in that business.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: What a terrible acquisition. Congrats,
Darius.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with
Barclays.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe just the first question around the free cash flow. So
you had good conversion in Q2. But I think the first half was running in the
80s-percent wise on conversion. You talked about some restructuring going
perhaps in the second half, Greg. So maybe just help us understand where you're
seeing free cash flow conversion perhaps for the year as a whole. And any other
major swing factors in the second half that we should think about.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. So I'm not going to give you a
conversion rate because, again, that also is dependent on where things come out
on the bottom line, which, as we discussed, we're not going to guide here
today. But as it relates to some of the pressure points, I mean obviously, we
harvested the receivables with our -- in Q2, which was good. And we also were
able to bring down some of our pass-through receivables. We worked very closely
with a lot of our customers, particularly in the airline space, to make sure
that we are managing some risks around that. So pleased about the results
there.

But going forward, again, as I mentioned, the solvency
risks, I think, are in front of us, not behind us. And so that may create some
challenges in the back half of the year if we start seeing additional
bankruptcies. And again, a lot of that depends on behavior, travel, any
stimulus that may come out in the back half of the year and so forth.

The other thing is I did mention repositioning. And we
booked over $300 million of repositioning. A lot of those are very fast
payback, less than -- think about less than a year kind of paybacks. And a lot
of those are very heavy from a severance perspective. So we spent about $170
million of cash repositioning in the first half of the year. I expect that to
be probably double that number in the back half of the year, roundabout. So
that's going to be a pressure point for us as well.

And then again, we are investing in capital. So this year,
if you think about back to when we originally did our outlook call early in the
year for 2020, we had about a $900 million capital budget. And even with this
decline, we're still at about a $900 million capital budget for the year.
That's because we did do some smart things to reduce CapEx in places where things
were slowing. But with all the growth programs that we're adding, and as Darius
mentioned, these things have triple-digit IRRs, so we're going to do them. So
our total CapEx for the year is going to be $900 million even this year. And we
only spent about $370 million in the first half. So that's going to ramp up in
half 2.

And then if you remember, we also did talk about at the very
first guidance call early in the year that we were going to have an extra
payroll cycle in 2020, and that's going to happen in 4Q. So that was like $150
million, $170 million.

So I think this would be our best cash quarter of the year.
And again, we're happy with the work that we've done, particularly around
receivables management. We have work to do on inventory now. And so those would
be the main things that I would highlight: CapEx, repositioning cash, that pay
cycle dynamic is going to play out in 4Q and we've got to work on our inventory
management.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. And I think from an investment
perspective, I would just add that we're nearly doubling our growth CapEx from
our original plans because I -- to be honest, I haven't seen IRRs ever that
were triple digit. And it's by far the best way we could put our capital to
work, some of these high-return CapEx projects, and they're terrific. And we're
not afraid to -- I mean, if need to be, we may even be targeting more
investments for growth in the second half.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL: So yes, I think your point just now
underscores that you're thinking clearly about the recovery and how to position
Honeywell for that in terms of organic investment. I guess following up on
that, how should we think about capital deployment from here? You're making
that push on the organic side. Are you looking out at the M&A landscape and
your balance sheet and thinking this is the right time to go ahead and start to
upscale the portfolio through acquisitions as you try and position yourself for
the next upturn? Or is it we probably should expect a balance of M&A and
buyback for the next 6 or 12 months?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think we're always going
to see some level -- we hope to see some balance, right? I mean, I think that's
kind of going to be the formula going forward. I certainly will tell you that
the M&A function is open for business. I mean, I think we -- it was prudent
for us to take a little bit of a pause in Q2 just to see how the world evolves,
how things are going to change and so on.

But, a, you kind of saw the kind of working capital
performance we have. We've further secured the balance sheet and protected it
even more. And I think you would agree that the balance sheet is very strong
and well-protected, well-funded. So in short, we're very much open for
business, both from an M&A perspective as well as potential buyback
perspective. And we already made a commitment that we're going to at least keep
share count flat from here, which is new news, and we're going to kind of take
a look at what opportunities are out there in the second half.

I mean, the M&A environment is just a little bit slower
just because everybody is focused on battling the crisis. But we think that,
that may open up a little bit more here in the second half, and we hope to be
active.

OPERATOR: Next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN, MD, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Just a question on Defense & Space, which was a highlight in
Aero. How much visibility do you have on DoD being able to accelerate payments
on programs? Basically, what happens in 2021? Is Defense & Space -- I'm not
asking about the end market outlook, but -- so there is a very sort of basic
cash outlay dynamics by the Department of Defense to you guys on existing
programs. So does that mean that 2021 has to be down? Or is there a chance that
2021 can be flat? Specifically on Defense & Space.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: At this stage, we're -- yes, at this
stage, we're not expecting a decline in '21 at this point. We feel like the
defense budget, as you highlighted, is still fairly robust. So not expecting a
material downshift from '20 to '21.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: And just a follow-up question. You
highlighted masks. And just, I guess, 2-pronged questions, I think. Right. I
mean it was great strategic move on your part on respiratory protections. So a,
do you have plans to continue to increase capacity on masks? And part two of
the question, does it open sort of strategic opportunities for you down the
line in safety to build on this new strength?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Andrew, I'd say -- well, first of
all, it's more than masks, right? So this isn't just masks. Mask's a part of
it, but it's other [PP&E]. It's also we're expanding capacity in our
sensing business for pressure sensors which go into a lot of the medical
equipment that our hospitals desperately need. So I would say the capacity
expansion is much more broad-based, and it's not just mask-oriented.

But certainly, as we look longer term, this sort of opens up
new opportunities for us. I would say maybe last, it's less about masks, but a little
bit more about steering the business towards serving the medical segment.
That's kind of how we'd think about it.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: And any plans to add additional
capacity, specifically on N95 in the second half on top of what you have...

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: I think -- yes, we've been doing that
gradually. And as we see the demand, we're certainly not going to be afraid to
add even more capacity. So as we -- the demand is still very robust. And I
think it's very possible that we could be adding even more capacity here in the
second half of the year.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with
Goldman Sachs.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE, VP & LEAD MULTI-INDUSTRY ANALYST,
GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Hey, Darius, maybe let's just
start on UOP and HPS. I know when we kind of talked intra-quarter, it seemed
like you were a little bit more sanguine about UOP kind of recovering quicker
just given miles driven should be fairly more resilient this cycle versus prior
cycles. I'm just curious whether that's changed at all and what you're seeing
along those lines.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think the segment for UOP
that was the most challenged is our gas processing segment, which obviously is
closely tied to the unconventional gas production in -- primarily in the U.S.
And as you know, that's very challenged, so we saw some pretty big drop off.

But even before this crisis hit, I mean, the mix in UOP can
vary substantially from quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year. And we always knew
we had a very heavy equipment mix in the business in the Q2 and Q3 of this
year. And even if this recession hadn't hit, we always had a challenging -- now
you -- mix going into it.

Now you combine that with kind of a push out of a lot of the
catalyst refills, push out of projects. Obviously, the refining capacity wasn't
as -- or demand wasn't as robust as any of us would hope here in Q2. If you
combine all these factors, and UOP, obviously, was a bit more challenged than
some of our other businesses,

HPS performed, I think, admirably in the quarter. I mean,
some of the products businesses were a little bit more challenged than the
systems businesses. So overall, pretty much aligned with our expectations.

And in terms of Advanced Materials, that one was heavily
impacted by the shutdowns in auto manufacturing and our supplied [sources],
which we expect to see some level of recovery here in the second half of the
year.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE: Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe
just my one follow-on question. Just going back to the cost-out commentary, and
Greg, maybe this question's for you. You made a comment about the just kind of
fixed cost pressure in 3Q versus 2Q. And so how should we be thinking about
like how much of the benefits are actually coming through in 3Q versus what
came through in 2Q?

And potentially, maybe talk a little bit about how the
temporary reversal, if there are temporary reversals that occur in 3Q, is
impacting that number.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. Yes. So that's exactly why I chose
the words I did because some of those temporary actions, furloughs, some of the
other reductions in discretionary spend, that may start ticking up during the
course of 3Q. And then as I mentioned, we're backfilling that with some of our
fixed -- or sorry, more permanent actions. But those are going to play out over
the course of June, July, August, September.

So the steepness of that backfill is probably going to be
more weighted towards the fourth quarter than the third. So we're doing our
level best to try to hold our fixed cost flat. They may not be in Q3, but I
would expect the 1 -- we talked about $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion as a range
with $700 million already achieved in the first half of the year. I would think
the balance of that is going to be a little bit more weighted towards the
fourth quarter than the third.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE: Got it. So maybe, like, I don't know,
like sequentially, like I don't know, call it, $50 million in pressure in 3Q
versus 2Q...

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: I'm not going to quote you a specific
number, Joe.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. It's just -- it's because we simply
can't call the timing of that perfectly. I mean, it's not -- obviously, when --
temporary actions are pretty easy to call because you can sort of unilaterally
implement that. When you go -- when you shift -- basically what we're doing in
Q3 and Q4 is we're shifting and substituting some of the temporary actions
we've taken in Q2 for permanent. The timing of that can't be exactly perfectly
called. And as Greg pointed out, I think it's going to be a little bit more
weighted towards Q4 than Q3.

OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with
Wolfe Research.

NIGEL EDWARD COE, MD & SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, WOLFE
RESEARCH, LLC: Really appreciate you making this a no-drama Friday. So I want
to go back to your comments around decrementals. And I appreciate the comments
that you think you can generate better decremental margins into the back half
of the year. And I'm wondering if that confidence extends to the Aerospace
margins. I think they were 39%, 40% or thereabouts in 2Q. And recognizing mix
is an important factor there. But do you think that you can maintain or even
improve on that performance in Aero?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, yes, I think the comment was more
in total. I think Aero is the toughest to call because of the uncertainty
around the mix that I talked about, particularly in air transport aftermarket,
which is, as you can imagine, a very interesting and higher-margin revenue
stream.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: And you could very easily see it being
sequentially down.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, so I'm not -- I can't tell you that
Aero's necessarily going to have better decrementals, at least in Q3, but we
are cautiously optimistic that Honeywell in total will continue to drive better
decremental margins as we move from Q3 and even more so into Q4, provided -- of
course, all of this is provided we don't have sort of a much broader and much
more aggressive Phase 2 of COVID-19, which I guess is, depending on who you
listen to, that, I guess, it's always possible in the fall. So that's kind of
how we're thinking about our math for the rest of the year.

NIGEL EDWARD COE: Okay. Very, very clear. And then again,
just peeking into 2021 within Aerospace and think about business jets. At a
very high level, how do you think the post-COVID world looks for the categories
you play in? Which is obviously the upper end of the markets. How does that
look from your perspective, your perch in the post-COVID world? It seems to me
like there could be some benefits, but I would be curious how you think about
that.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, like, a couple of points.
Number one is I think that you saw the bottom in Q2. See a gradual slow
improvement as we move into Q3, Q4. And then into 2021, we're going to continue
to see improvement. I think the real discontinuity here where we could see a
much more dramatic improvement, which is really going to be tied to a medical
solution, which is probably a vaccine, when it gets distributed. Because the
level of the leisure traveler is actually a little bit better than expected.
People are traveling.

But we need really that second leg to come in, which is the
business traveler. And that part of it, we think, is going to happen after we
get a much broader distribution of a vaccine, which right now, it's anybody's
guess when it will happen, but I think the news overall is actually pretty
good. And I don't think it's crazy to think that we may even have a certified
vaccine before the end of the year this year now, then we also have to think
about the distribution timing and so on.

So we're optimistic that certainly, there's going to be a
solution in the first half of next year, which obviously will stimulate a
greater level of air travel.

MARK BENDZA: Lauren, let's take one more question, please.

OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from John Inch with
Gordon Haskett.

JOHN GEORGE INCH, MD & SENIOR ANALYST OF
MULTI-INDUSTRIALS, GORDON HASKETT RESEARCH ADVISORS: Darius and Greg, so if you
look at your restructuring programs in the 60% to 70% of structural, how would
you anticipate, say, your pro forma headcount ending 2020? I just glanced the
K, it looks like you started the year with 113,000 employees. Where would we
expect that kind of to end up based on -- and I don't mean on a furlough basis.
I'm trying to sort of think about the significance in terms of headcount based
on your structural actions that you're taking and what you've called out.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think it's tough to call at this
point, and I'll tell you why. Because although we obviously know roughly what
we have in our restructuring plan. So we know what we're going to do there.
What we don't know is the capacity additions because all the work -- some of
the reductions are taking place in places like Aerospace, to a lesser extent,
PMT and so on. But now we're adding hundreds, if not thousands of people in
SPS, and we don't think we're done. I think that we're going to be making
further investments in people, further investments in capacity. So I think it's
a little bit too early to call exactly what that -- our staffing may look like
at year-end. And I'd hate to give you a number which may prove to be
inaccurate.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: No, that's fine. The magnitude of the
actions areas seem pretty substantial. So I'm just trying to sort of
triangulate that. Could that mean, if you weren't adding capacity, you're
taking out 5% of your headcount? Or how -- what else would you say about that?
I suppose is kind of the question.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think it's Aero, it's
substantial. It's closer to double digit. In some of the other businesses,
we're adding headcount. So a little bit all over the place. I mean, I think
we've tried to be -- protect as many jobs as we can because we frankly don't
want to be doing a lot of job reductions. But I also have to be realistic, and
we have to be realistic, that we don't think that this is a quarter or 2
phenomenon in Aerospace. And unfortunately, the business is going to shrink for
a little while.

We do think -- I'm not -- by the way, I'm not so pessimistic
that I think Aero is going to be down till 2024 as I've heard some estimate. I
actually think it's going to come back a bit faster than that, and it's aligned
to a medical solution. But realistically, it's probably not going to get back
to the 2019 levels until at least 2022 or maybe even a bit later. So we're
sizing the business for that kind of a reduction.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: Yes. That makes sense. Just as a
follow-up, guys. This ultraviolet airplane cabin cleaning technology, is it
applicable to -- or could you even sort of develop product for a commercial
building application or even residential? And that would seem to be like a
pretty big deal if you could actually extrapolate that.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. No. We're working on exactly that
type of a solution which treats the air with ultraviolet light and obviously
results in a much higher air quality than anything out there. So that is very
much part of our thinking and part of our solution. So we're doing some studies
around the timing required, exposure to UV light required. And that's very much
part of our thinking.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: Yes, no. You get that on the New York City
subway, the economy might actually come back.

OPERATOR: And that concludes today's question-and-answer
session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius
Adamczyk for any additional or closing remarks.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: I want to thank our shareowners for
their continued support of Honeywell. We are focused on continuing to perform
for our shareowners, our customers and our employees in any environment. We are
well positioned to manage through challenging times with our balanced
portfolio, track record of execution and a strong balance sheet. I'm excited
about the future of Honeywell despite the current challenging -- challenges
facing the global economy. We are capturing new growth opportunities by
providing innovative solutions for new customer needs, and our operational
rigor will continue to serve us well.

Thank you for listening, and please stay safe and healthy.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
Honeywell's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As
a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and I would now like to
introduce you to your host for today's conference, Mark Bendza, Vice President
of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

MARK BENDZA, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank
you, Savannah. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's First Quarter 2020
Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me today are Chairman and CEO,
Darius Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg
Lewis. Also joining us today is Senior Vice President and Chief Supply Chain
Officer, Torsten Pilz, who is here to participate in Q&A related to our
supply chain.

This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP
reconciliations are available on our website at 

. Note that elements of this
presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view
of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can
change based on many factors, including changing economic and business
conditions, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. Unless otherwise
noted, the plans described herein are not final and may be modified or even
abandoned at any time. No final decision will be taken with respect to such
plans without prior satisfaction of any applicable requirements with respect to
informing, consulting or negotiating with employees or their representatives.

We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that may
affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
This morning, we will review our financial results for the first quarter of
2020 and share our views on the second quarter of 2020. As always, we'll leave
time for your questions at the end.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO,
Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, CEO &
PRESIDENT, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning,
everyone. Before we turn to slides, I would like to make a few opening remarks.
We're clearly holding this call during unprecedented times. The COVID-19
pandemic has widespread impacts on our communities, from our families, friends
and neighbors to our employees, customers and suppliers. At Honeywell, our #1
priority is the health and safety of our employees. We have taken many
precautions to preserve the well-being of over 100,000 employees around the
world, resulting in very few infections across the company. Each of our
employees is demonstrating a strong commitment to our company, to our customers
during these challenging times. I sincerely thank them for their strength,
resilience and courage.

I would also like to express my gratitude to the men and
women on the front lines of this fight. The health care workers are working
every day to overcome this global health emergency. They are the heroes, and
we're doing everything we can to support them from increased production of
personal protective equipment and other critical supplies.

This morning, we'll discuss 6 key topics. First, we'll
review our first quarter performance, a quarter during which we over-delivered
on our original EPS and segment margin commitments despite a rapidly
deteriorating environment. I am particularly proud of this outcome as even in a
crisis, we demonstrated that our investors can count on a reliable, say/do
outcome.

Second, we will discuss how we're working to keep our
employees and the men and women on the front line safe and healthy. Third,
we'll discuss our outlook for the second quarter. The next few quarters are
likely to be amongst the most unpredictable quarters we have ever experienced,
and our visibility is limited under the current circumstances. Accordingly, our
outlook for the second quarter will have less detail than usual, but we'll
provide a level of detail that is commensurate with our visibility in the current
environment. We're also suspending our full year financial guidance until the
economic environment stabilizes and we can once again provide a reliable
forecast. Fourth, we will provide an overview of strong balance sheet and
liquidity position, which reflect years of responsible balance sheet
management.

Fifth, we will outline decisive and expeditious actions we
have already taken to manage through the crisis, protect shareholder value and
emerge stronger than ever. We cannot control the pandemic, but we can control
how we're mitigating risk to our operations and supply chain, engaging with
customers, managing costs and preserving liquidity. As you will see, we are
applying Honeywell's usual level of discipline and diligence to this
unprecedented situation. We've already locked in plans, which we are executing
so we are not searching for answers as the crisis continues to unfold. And
finally, we'll provide an overview of some new opportunities that are well
aligned to our portfolio.

Let's begin on Slide 2. We delivered EPS and segment margin
expansion above the high end of our original guidance in a rapidly deteriorated
environment. Earnings per share for the first quarter was $2.21, up 15%
year-over-year, and segment margin expanded 140 basis points to 21.8%.

The global spread of COVID-19 during the first quarter
created operational constraints for Honeywell, our suppliers and our customers.
In some cases, access to customer sites was restricted impacting our ability to
complete deliveries and provide services. COVID-19 and the OPEC+ dispute also
caused demand weakness, particularly in our short-cycle businesses and in the
aerospace and oil and gas end markets. The combination of these effects
resulted in an organic sales decline of 4%.

As you have come to expect from Honeywell, we responded
quickly to changing conditions by implementing cost control measures, which
combined with our productivity rigor and the commercial excellence, drove 140
basis points of segment margin expansion, 90 basis points above the high end of
our first quarter guidance. We also generated $800 million of free cash flow
despite lower cash collections from customers at the end of the quarter due to
the challenging macroeconomic conditions.

We continue to implement a responsible and balanced capital
deployment program during the first quarter. We deployed $2.7 billion of
capital across share repurchases, dividends and high-return CapEx investments
to position our company for the future. This was a challenging first quarter
due to the rapid escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the OPEC+ dispute,
where effectively -- but we effectively managed to the challenge to
over-deliver our profit commitments, demonstrating our strong say/do.

Let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss our response to the pandemic.
As the COVID-19 pandemic started to evolve, we acted quickly to ensure the
safety of our employees as well as to aid in the frontline response to the
crisis. We implemented several precautionary measures to keep our employees
safe including travel restrictions for all employees and full-time work from
home for nearly all of our nonmanufacturing employees. At Honeywell locations
where work cannot be performed remotely, such as manufacturing sites, we
implemented measures to protect our employees, including restricting visitors,
enhancing site cleaning and sanitation regiments, providing hand sanitizers,
staggering shifts and lunch breaks and putting safe distance practices in place
where possible. Where social distancing is impossible, we have also provided
employees with masks. We have also implemented mandatory temperature screening
at several locations and are putting capabilities in place to expand that
practice as needed. We'll continue to comply with all local and national
guidance from governments and health authorities.

In addition, we announced that Honeywell will pay for
coronavirus testing and treatment costs that are not covered by employees'
insurance and will provide a full year of paid sick time upfront for U.S.
nonexempt employees. Finally, we announced a $10 million employee relief fund
to help employees in financial distress.

We also recognize the urgency to keep medical professionals
safe. We have quickly ramped up production of our personal protective equipment
to address unprecedented demand. We recently announced that we're adding
manufacturing capabilities to our existing sites in Smithfield, Rhode Island
and Phoenix, Arizona to produce millions of N95 masks to help support the
urgent need for critical safety equipment. The additional capacity of these 2
facilities is expected to create more than 1,000 new jobs and produce more than
20 million N95 disposable masks monthly to support the U.S. government's
efforts to combat the virus. Our Smithfield, Rhode Island facility is already producing
N95 masks. We installed a production line in only 5 weeks, a process that
normally takes 9 months to complete.

Honeywell is supporting the fight against COVID-19 other
ways as well, including increasing production of our other critical personal protective
equipment, such as safety eyewear and face shields, increasing production of
sensors used in ventilators and providing testing services to ventilator
manufacturers.

Finally, we recently announced that we will shift
manufacturing operations at 2 chemical manufacturing sites in the U.S. and
Germany to produce and donate hand sanitizers to government agencies in
response to shortages created by the COVID-19 pandemic. These sites, which
manufacture high-purity solutions for laboratory research and testing
applications, will produce hand sanitizers over the next few months for
government agencies to distribute to entities in need. These are certainly
challenging times, and we're proud of our role and the many actions we have
taken to produce essential personal protective equipment to keep the heroes on
the front lines safe.

Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 4 to discuss our
first quarter results in more detail as well as to provide our views on the
second quarter and the balance sheet.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS, SENIOR VP & CFO, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. In the first
quarter, organic sales declined by 4% as the effects of the pandemic spread
across the globe, creating supply chain challenges and restricting access to
customer sites, which constrained our ability to deliver particularly in the
last 2 to 3 weeks of the month. Aerospace sales were up 1% on an organic basis
as demand for key U.S. Department of Defense programs and guidance and
navigation systems in Defense and Space was partially offset by the steep
reduction of flight hours and a slowdown in air transport OE build rates,
primarily from our previously communicated lowered 737 MAX deliveries to Boeing
in commercial aerospace.

Safety and Productivity Solutions sales were down 9%
organically. Increased demand for respiratory, personal protective equipment
was more than offset by weakness in the short-cycle part of the portfolio.
Intelligrated sales were down about 12% due to the timing of several major
systems projects as expected. As a reminder, Intelligrated organic growth in
the first quarter of last year was approximately 50% up due to strong major
systems backlog conversion, aftermarket services and increased demand for voice
solutions, which created a very tough comp for this quarter. Intelligrated
backlog remains robust, approximately up 40% year-over-year and as we discussed
in our last call, we expect growth to reaccelerate in the second quarter.

Honeywell Building Technologies sales were down 6% on an
organic basis, primarily driven by softness in building solutions projects and
lower short-cycle volumes in security and building management products.
Finally, Performance Materials and Technologies, down 5%, was negatively
affected by the sharp decline in oil prices stemming from the OPEC+ dispute and
the COVID-19-related disruptions, with HPS down 6% and UOP down 2%. Continued
illegal HFC imports into Europe and lower automotive refrigerant volumes in
Advanced Materials also contributed to the sales decline.

Despite these challenges, our productivity rigor, combined
with commercial excellence and swift cost actions, drove segment margin
expansion of 140 basis points, well above our original guidance of 20 to 50
basis points. We delivered earnings per share of $2.21, up 15% and well above
the high end of our original guidance range of $2.02 to $2.07. Segment profit
expansion drove $0.04 of earnings growth, while a lower adjusted effective tax
rate, primarily due to new India tax legislation, drove $0.13 of EPS
improvement compared to last year. Even without the favorable tax impact, the
first quarter EPS was $0.01 above the high end of our guidance and up 8%
year-over-year. We generated $800 million of free cash flow, down 31%
year-over-year, primarily driven by lower sales and slower collections,
particularly in late March.

We continued to execute our capital deployment plans in the
first quarter. We deployed over $600 million to dividends and $1.9 billion of
share repurchases, substantially completing our full year 2020 share repurchase
commitment. We also invested over $100 million on capital expenditures in the
quarter, including investments that will enable us to produce millions more N95
masks to help the coronavirus relief effort. Overall, this was a very
challenging quarter, but we continued to execute and achieved or over-delivered
on our segment profit, margin expansion and EPS commitments.

Now let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our operations. Our
portfolio is highly aligned to guidelines for essential and critical businesses
around the world. Our teams have been working tirelessly to ensure that we are
able to provide equipment and services to our customers in critical end markets
globally in compliance with government safety regulations.

The spread of COVID-19 has created operational challenges
for Honeywell, our suppliers and our customers as governments and companies
implement measures to slow the spread of the pandemic and keep employees safe.
These challenges included temporary site closures, staffing shortages,
inability to access customer sites for service and project engineers and
transportation and logistics disruptions. The operational constraints change
daily. However, we have implemented rigorous business continuity processes to
ensure they are proactively addressed and minimized to the extent possible.
Though operational disruptions have caused headwinds, our integrated supply
chain team's efforts, under Torsten's leadership, have been able to keep us
running. After the outbreak in China, we set up a tactical operations center in
January to monitor and manage global supply risk and establishes processes to
identify and assist suppliers in financial distress. We continue to monitor all
suppliers to ensure they remain operational, and we provide support to help
them reopen when they experience temporary closures. Today, well over 90% of
our suppliers are operational.

Our logistics team has been proactively securing
transportation and freight modes to ensure transportation availability amid
supply-and-demand imbalances. As it stands today, over 90% of our sites are
operational globally. Approximately 15% of our sites are currently experiencing
staffing constraints in select regions around the world, including sites in
Mexico, Europe and Asia Pac, where governments have mandated up to 25% to 75%
reductions in staffing.

We are pleased with our progress in responding to these
operational constraints and mitigating those impacts. We experience new
headwinds every day, but we continue to monitor our supply chain, work closely
with our suppliers and respond swiftly when new challenges arise. But because
of these actions, our global operations are running with limited but
unpredictable disruptions -- or interruptions, and these are some of the
dynamics that are contributing to our challenge on predictability of our
short-term financial outlook.

Now let's turn to Slide 6, and we'll discuss our segment
outlook for the second quarter. As Darius -- so previously, the next few
quarters are likely to be among the most unpredictable we have ever
experienced. And our visibility has limits under the current circumstances.
Accordingly, we are suspending providing full financial guidance until the
economic environment stabilizes and we can once again give reliable and
comprehensive forecasts. We believe it is important that we provide a level of
precision that is commensurate with our ability to forecast in the current
environment and, therefore, you'll see a different set of inputs versus our
normal guidance.

Starting with Aerospace, we expect more than a 50% decrease
in global air transport flight hours and more than a 40% decrease in global
business aviation flight hours in the second quarter based on industry sources,
which will significantly impact our commercial aftermarket businesses. In
addition, our commercial original equipment business will be impacted by the
ongoing 737 MAX production delay, OEM furloughs and temporary shutdowns and
lower business jet demand due to the economic slowdown. However, government
defense budgets remain intact, and we expect continued growth in Defense and
Space, though this will be more than offset by the broader end-market
challenges, and significant demand reduction in the commercial aerospace
segment. As a result, we expect aerospace sales to be down more than 25%
compared to the second quarter of 2019.

Moving to PMT. The dramatic volatility and decline in oil
prices related to the OPEC+ dispute, coupled with the COVID-19-related supply
chain disruptions, has created a challenging environment. We are encouraged by
the OPEC+ production cut agreement, and we hope for even broader action.
However, we need to see a sustained increase in demand to see a more meaningful
impact in the marketplace. As we've said in the past, oil price volatility and
sustained pressure on prices often leads to project delays and customer CapEx
and OpEx budget cuts, which is what we are seeing today. We expect a steep
decline in refining production in the second quarter and continued weakness in gas
processing. The reduction of customer CapEx and OpEx budgets will create
headwinds for our Products businesses, and Process Solutions in UOP with
declines in field services, equipment and catalyst shipments. Additionally, we
anticipate new projects will push to the right, putting pressure on UOP
licensing and engineering volumes in the near term.

As we have discussed in the last 2 earnings calls, we
entered 2020 with a healthy backlog of global mega-projects in Process
Solutions, and we do expect to burn those down over the next few quarters.
Although we have not received any long-cycle cancellations, we are expecting
new orders to decline significantly in the second quarter.

With Advanced Materials, automotive plant closures will
drive lower refrigerant volumes and a projected slowdown in global construction
will further pressure sales. However, in specialty products, we are encouraged
by strong demand for our health care packaging, armor and research chemical
products. Altogether, we expect PMT sales to be down more than 15% compared to
the second quarter of 2019.

In HBT, we see the impact of COVID-19 pandemic as
potentially shorter term in nature. In the current environment, nonresidential
projects in multiple verticals have paused, and customers are deferring
nonessential spending, impacting the timing of long-cycle Building Solutions
projects and delaying purchase of security, building management and fire
products. Lower building occupancy and temporary disruptions to site access are
driving delayed timing of certain Building Solutions services. However, we
believe these are largely short-term timing effects, and we continue to see the
underlying demand, particularly in fire and security products and our services
where orders grew in the first quarter. So Building Technologies may begin to
stabilize as businesses begin to reopen. We expect HBT sales to be down more
than 10% compared to the second quarter of 2019.

Finally, in SPS, the surge in e-commerce, as government
enacts social distancing requirements, has created more demand for our
warehouse automation business and supports continued conversion of our robust
Intelligrated backlog. In the second quarter, we will see growth from the major
systems projects that we booked last year. Our Intelligrated backlog remains
strong, up approximately 40% year-over-year, and we expect this business to
perform well for the remainder of the year. However, the macro conditions are
resulting in headwinds in our short-cycle SPS businesses, including
productivity products, gas sensing and retail. Weakness in aerospace, heavy
equipment and automotive end markets is also resulting in headwinds in the
sensing and IoT business, which will partially be offset by increased demand
for sensors in medical ventilators and respiratory equipment.

Finally, we are, of course, seeing record-level demand for
respiratory masks and other personal protective equipment, and we expect that
demand to continue for the foreseeable future. Mask production at our
Smithfield, Rhode Island facility is already online and our Phoenix facility is
expected to come online in the second quarter. PPE orders were up triple digits
in the first quarter, with strength in respiratory, head, eye, face, gloves and
clothing categories. Our personal protective equipment backlog is now up triple
digits. In the second quarter, however, we expect the macro and short-cycle
headwinds to more than offset the growth in PPE and Intelligrated. We expect
SPS sales to be down more than 5% compared to the second quarter of 2019.

So while our diverse portfolio is resilient, the combined
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the OPEC+ dispute are meaningful across
the global economy. While we have a rigorous MOS in place to manage our
operational risks, the continuity of our operations as well as those of our
customers and suppliers continues to change daily as the impacts of the health
crisis continue to unfold and evolve. As a result, we expect a very challenging
second quarter, with sales expected to be down more than 15% for the company
versus the prior year.

Now let's move on to Slide 7 and discuss our balance sheet
and liquidity. Our strong balance sheet provides a stable foundation as well as
opportunity for our company during challenging times such as these. We have
maintained a premium credit rating for over 25 years, which has been a
long-term competitive advantage for us, especially during difficult times like
the downturn in 2008 and '09, and again, today. It reflects many years of
responsible capital management, good stewardship of our pension plans and an
emphasis on prudent leverage and significant liquidity.

We exit 2019 in an incredibly strong position, and we took
additional actions during the first quarter to further bolster our financial
flexibility as a precaution in these unpredictable times. As discussed in our
outlook call, we further derisked our pension plan by increasing the plan's
asset allocation to 60% fixed income in the first quarter, which has proved to
be prudent as our pension plan remain overfunded at the end of the quarter and
requires no additional funding, even with the tremendous volatility in the
capital markets.

We also refinanced EUR 1 billion of February maturities with
a euro bond offering maturing in 2024 and 2032. We have no remaining bond maturities
coming due in 2020 and only $800 million of bond maturities coming due within
the next year. Most recently, we announced a $6 billion 2-year delayed draw
term loan agreement, which combined with our pre-existing $5.5 billion of
undrawn revolving credit facilities, brings our total undrawn sources of
liquidity to $11.5 billion.

As of the end of the first quarter, we had $8.8 billion of
cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet and a net debt-to-EBITDA
ratio well below 1. Altogether, we have over $20 billion of cash, short-term
investments and undrawn sources of liquidity readily available compared to only
$800 million of long-term debt maturities and $3.5 billion of commercial paper
coming due within the next year.

And as you can see on this slide, our balance sheet and
liquidity profile is significantly stronger than it was heading into the 2008,
2009 downturn when we were more levered, had less than $6 billion of liquidity
undrawn, and our pension was severely underfunded. We will focus on
preservation of liquidity during the second quarter and expect to enter the
third quarter with significant capital deployment options should we have
greater clarity on economic conditions.

With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Thank you, Greg. Let's turn to Slide 8.
As the COVID-19 pandemic started to spread, we immediately acted to maintain
the continuity of our operations and keep serving our customers. These actions,
in addition to Honeywell's diversified portfolio, strong balance sheet and
history of discipline and resilience in uncertain times, demonstrate our
ability to manage through a difficult situation. We've already discussed our
efforts within the supply chain and balance sheet this morning so let me walk
you through the -- our 3 other key priorities.

Starting with sales generation. We rapidly redeployed around
1,000 of our sellers to align to areas where we're seeing market demand,
particularly on our health care, e-commerce supply chain, remote factory
operations, cyber security and PPE offerings. We modified the sales incentive
plans for our 6,500 sellers, ensuring our sales teams have the proper
motivation to find the areas of growth in our target markets. Also, to ensure
our sales managers and sellers have the skills they need and best practices to
virtually connect with our customers, we developed playbooks containing sales
best practices and lessons learned from our China team, who were the first to
implement virtual selling techniques.

While not easy, our sellers have embraced the challenge and
opportunity of maintaining a high level of communication with our customers.
One of our HBT employees even turned a room in his house into a live demo
center for customers, and he used it to launch a product to 40 of our top
European partners via video.

We're also in the process of launching e-commerce websites
to enable our transactional customers to receive product information and place
orders quickly and efficiently. For example, our research chemicals business
launched a new website to enable their customers, performing important lab work
associated with COVID-19 pandemic, to quickly and easily replenish their
laboratory supplies.

Our sales and demand generation actions are being reinforced
by rigorous weekly review process led by me personally, together with Jeff
Kimbell, our Chief Commercial Officer. Demand generation remains a priority
even in these difficult conditions.

Let's move next to our cost-control actions. Our focus is on
maintaining our employee base while also positioning the company for long-term
performance post crisis. We have rapidly implemented a series of measures to
conserve cash and reduce costs, which will help mitigate the potential need for
more drastic actions later and will give us more flexibility to respond to
prolonged downturn or sudden disruptions in our end markets. Our cost-reduction
efforts will reduce costs by at least $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2020 and
will be more heavily weighted in the third and fourth quarters of the year.
This includes approximately $200 million of benefits from prior year
repositioning.

We have eliminated or sharply reduced discretionary
expenses, limited hiring and canceled merit increases on a global basis for all
levels of the company. Additionally, our businesses have, in some locations,
initiated a rotating schedule, reduced work weeks or eliminated work weeks. All
executives, up to and including senior staff and the Board of Directors, have
also reduced base pay this year and eliminated or substantially lowered
incentive payouts in 2020. We're also taking proactive steps to preserve jobs
at our manufacturing sites, including shortening or staggering work schedules
to match production volumes of demand. The expeditious completions of phase 1 cost
plan, previously described, is enabling us to complete a phase 2 cost action
plan, which will -- should be developed within 30 days. We believe that these
cost controls will enable Honeywell to respond to deteriorating market and
economic condition as the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic becomes
apparent.

Finally, let's discuss how we're optimizing working capital
to match demand in the current environment. We have a solid governance model
around cash management and working capital, and we executed a comprehensive
risk assessment for customers and suppliers to preserve our strong cash
position. We reviewed the policies for the highest risk and top revenue
customers to make sure we have the appropriate parameters in place to protect
our accounts receivable, and we implemented tighter exception criteria and
enhanced executive leadership team review and approval. Additionally, we also
set up processes to identify and assess high-risk suppliers. We trained and
mobilized over 600 procurement professionals to contact suppliers and take
their financial temperature. Many suppliers have already received essential
help to keep their doors open and their products and services flowing to
Honeywell's factories.

Having agile supply chain processes is more important than
ever to manage our expenses and cash investments. Therefore, we condensed our
sales, inventory and operations planning process from a traditional monthly
cycle to a weekly cycle. Combining this with sales leading indicators, we are
sensing demand changes and realigning our inventory and production schedules
faster than ever. Together, the actions we have implemented across the company
have positioned Honeywell to effectively manage through uncertain times, and we
are confident in our continued execution resilience.

Let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss our repositioning plan in
more detail. As you would expect from us, we're accelerating plans for
permanent cost reductions to ensure our cost base reflects the macroeconomic
environment particularly in Aerospace and PMT, where we see the end-market
challenges we have discussed this morning. We have ample capacity for
repositioning in the second quarter, and we're planning for a net reposition of
$175 million to $275 million. Our actions this year will provide cost-reduction
tails into 2021 and are proactively preparing a phase 2 plan, which we'll
likely deploy as we assess market conditions.

Now looking at Slide 10. Let me take a moment to share some
of the emerging areas of demand that we're addressing for our customers. In the
health care space, we see opportunities across multiple businesses. We're
increasing productions of sensors for medical ventilators and our sensing and
IoT business. Our research chemicals business is supporting scientists around
the world in the research, development and production of COVID-19 test kits,
therapies and the vaccines by prioritizing and ramping production of
high-quality analytical products that meet their application needs. And we are
offering expedited support services to our pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical
customers in our Aclar business to help facilitate faster health care packaging
decisions for COVID-19 oral solid medicine. We have already mentioned that many
actions we're taking to meet increased demands for personal protective
equipment, including masks, eyewear and face shields.

In both Building Technologies and Process Solutions, we see
strong demand for cybersecurity and advanced remote access and monitoring for
buildings and plants, as people increasingly work from remote locations. Also
in HBT, we have a suite of healthy building capabilities ready to deploy for
customers who are focused on the health and well-being of their buildings'
occupants. In SPS, there's strong demand for warehouse automation and supply
chain analytics driven by surging e-commerce.

And finally, in Aerospace, as passengers return to normal
flying behaviors, there will be increased focus on passenger health and safety,
which dovetails nicely with our leadership in environmental control systems for
aircraft. We're also offering creative solutions to airlines and airports to
protect passengers and to restore confidence in flying. So although the macro
environment is creating challenges, it is also creating new customer needs that
we're well equipped to address.

With that, let's wrap up on Slide 11. This quarter
represents the first of what will be some challenging times ahead. We exceeded
our segment profit, segment margin and earnings commitment, EPS growth of 15%
despite the substantial challenges we faced. We remain cautious as the
magnitude and final impact of COVID-19 pandemic and OPEC+ dispute is unknown.
As a result, there's significant uncertainty around commercial aerospace, oil
and gas and short-cycle demand, which we expect will meaningfully impact the
second quarter. However, we have a diversified portfolio and significant
balance sheet strength to provide resilience in these uncertain times.

We acted quickly and prudently to ensure the health and
safety of our employees, continuing to serve our customers and protecting our
shareholders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We took decisive actions to
reduce our cost base, optimize working capital and further bolster our strong
balance sheet and liquidity. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19
impact on our operations, and we're confident in our ability to manage through
the market volatility. We're playing a critical role in keeping medical
professionals safe through expanded production of N95 masks, other PPE needs,
sensors for medical equipment and ventilators and new production of hand
sanitizer.

Despite the challenges -- challenging times, we remain
committed to our strategic initiatives in the Honeywell Connected Enterprise,
supply chain transformation and Honeywell Digital. And we continue investing in
our future through breakthrough initiatives, new product introductions,
next-generation innovation across our entire portfolio. I am proud of everyone
at Honeywell, who's working hard to adapt and deliver in this challenging
environment. I am confident we will emerge from this crisis even stronger than
ever.

With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.

MARK BENDZA: Thank you, Darius. Darius, Greg and Torsten are
now available to answer your questions. Savannah, please open the line for
Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will
come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: So just on kind of the second quarter color, I appreciate that. You
guys have a gross margin of around kind of mid-30s or whatever it is. Should we
expect because of the significant kind of drop off here that -- and a little
bit more of a back half weighting on these cost saves, that you'd decrement
kind of a little bit more than that on a headline, kind of segment profit basis
in 2Q? Just trying to kind of get an idea of the rough deleveraging you're kind
of expecting in the business. Is there anything in the mix that would move that
around? Just curious on that front. And then would you expect that, that is
kind of the low point of the year, given that this should kind of -- all this
economic stuff should begin to kind of heal a bit and then the cost saves come
in?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, Steve. A couple [there]. I mean in
terms of Q2, yes, I mean, I think we expect our worst decrementals for the year
in Q2. I mean, obviously, we're in the middle of some cost actions. We're doing
that. We expect Q2 to be the most depressed from a GDP perspective. Our sort of
underlying assumptions here, and I emphasize the word assumptions, is that GDP
Q2 will be the worst, improve in Q3 and improve in Q4. So obviously, our
margins will kind of follow that trend. Q2 will be the bottom. We expect some
level of improvement in Q3 and further in Q4. That's sort of the overall trend.

We can't give a level of precision on this because,
obviously, some of the cost actions, timing of that, that's still a little bit
not totally within our control. And -- but we're taking aggressive actions, not
just with the phase 1 that was discussed, but we're also looking in phase 2,
which is going to be deployed -- well, finalized and deployed within the next
60 days for certain.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Got it. So I guess you're not really
kind of commenting on something you could hold around that, maybe a little bit
higher than that gross margin rate? Just kind of help frame us for that --
frame that for us.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, I mean, clearly, our Q2
decrementals will be worse. I mean, that's -- and then they'll start improving
for that. I don't know that I can give you any more precision than that. I mean
it's -- otherwise, it would -- essentially providing guidance.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Right. And then just on the buyback,
you guys talked about kind of completing your 2020 program, but obviously, your
balance sheet is in good shape. I mean, I don't know where you bought back the
stock this quarter. But are you -- do you have kind of capacity? And are you
willing that, as you get better visibility on the second half, that you could
be opportunistic in the event things pull back again?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean obviously, we have the
liquidity, and cash is not a concern for us, I mean, given our position,
balance sheet, the term loan we took on. So I mean we have a lot of optionality
in the second half. I mean I wouldn't expect much in the second quarter. I mean
I think this is the time to kind of assess the situation, see what's happening,
see what's going on in the medical arena, see if the markets are turning
around. So I wouldn't expect much here in the Q2 time frame, but we have a lot
of optionality in the second half to potentially get back in the market, but
we'll see.

I think that we're going to kind of hold -- tap on the
brakes here in Q2, see what happens, implement our -- both our growth plans.
And I emphasize the growth plans because I think that there are some
opportunities even in this crisis. Obviously, also execute the cost plans as
well because that's what we have to do in this environment is deal with
reality. And then we'll relook at capital allocation as it relates to buybacks
and so on as we move into Q3 and beyond.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Got it. Or sorry, one more way to go
about this. For the year, are the cost saves enough to kind of hold the
decrement to in and around your gross margin? Is that kind of what these --
what kind of the cost saves are aimed to do?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think it's too early to tell,
Steve, because we still haven't fully quantified the phase 2 impact.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: And we don't want -- we don't know what
the revenue reduction is going to be, strictly the...

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. So the problem of giving you
numbers here is that we're operating with 2 or 3 different variables, all of
which could move dramatically, so then you get down to a guess and as
Honeywell, we don't guess. I mean, when we say something, we do it, which was
evidenced by our Q1 delivery of segment profit.

OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Scott Davis with
Melius Research.

SCOTT REED DAVIS, FOUNDING PARTNER, CHAIRMAN, CEO &
RESEARCH ANALYST OF MULTI-INDUSTRY RESEARCH, MELIUS RESEARCH LLC: I guess just
a little bit of follow-up on the balance sheet question from Steve. I mean,
you're in a great position, and buybacks is one element, but M&A is
another. Is there an active pipeline you can continue to work? Is it just too
impossible to even think about doing deals right now? Or is there something
maybe for later in the year? Just some thoughts on that.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, I mean, as you can imagine, a
lot of the M&A activity is kind of a little bit of on pause. I think as
being a buyer, that's probably a good thing because I don't want to necessarily
be buying off of 2019 comps. I don't think that, that makes a lot of sense. But
given our balance sheet, which is in great position, yes, I think that this is
an area which could be an opportunity in the second half of the year. I think
the valuation should and will change. I mean, that's pretty obvious.

But whenever you have a sudden change in economic conditions
like we do now, which really flipped. I mean, they literally flipped from the
beginning of March. The end of March, we're sitting in a dramatically different
position. It takes a little bit of time or reality for dollars to sync in, in
terms of what their valuation should be. I mean, everybody still wants to value
their business off of 2019 figures, and that just isn't realistic anymore, and
you kind of have to look forward rather than look backward.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Yes. I could not agree more. Just a point
of clarification. You've got this $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion cost out, and it
looks like it's more kind of a shorter-term stuff. And then you have this $375
million to $500 million repositioning charges. Should we think about those as
kind of more short term and then the repositioning as the structural stuff? Is
there any way to reconcile as part of that cost out in the $1.1 billion to $1.3
billion?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Let me give you a little color on
that, which is, don't think of that as mostly short term. Think about that $1.1
billion to $1.3 billion, 30% to 40% of it is roughly short term. But the rest
of it is permanent, so that's -- it's not all just short-term stuff. And I
think you should think about the phase 2 actions, it's not all permanent, but
majority permanent.

OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Andrew Obin with
Bank of America.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN, MD, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Just a question on Aerospace. 25% decline of second quarter, I think,
quite a bit better than a lot of the peers that have guided...

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: More than -- just, Andrew, more than
25%. That's not -- point...

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Just to be clear. Yes, it's not a
25%. It's more than.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: More than 25%. So I'm just trying to
figure out. I think your peers have sort of been guiding more 30%s, 40%s, 50%s.
So just any color between the pieces within Aerospace, what's happening into
the second quarter? And I know you have provided some. And also, how does it
work out sequentially through the year? Is the second quarter the bottom? Or is
it going to get worse?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: So what you're seeing for us, of
course, is that we've got 40% roughly of our Aerospace business is Defense and
Space, and that's continuing to grow. It grew 7% in the first quarter, and we
see a nice growth trajectory in Q2 as well. And it really is in the commercial
side of the business that we're going to see a substantial acceleration of that
growth rate coming down. So -- and again, relative to the back half of the
year, as Darius described, we expect the second quarter to be the worst it's
going to get. But to be honest, we don't really know. And that's, again, part
of the reason why we're not giving full year guidance. We're telling you the
best we can see here out in the -- in the very short term, 90 days. And all of
the aspects of what happens with the health crisis, when do people go back and
fly again, that is not something that is very clear to anyone, including us.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: Yes. I'd -- just a follow-up on free
cash flow: a, any big onetime items that kept cash flow down year-over-year and
ability to release working capital down the line?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: It was mostly receivables. Our
collections were down year-on-year. Again, particularly as you got down to the
last few weeks of March, they slowed dramatically. You can imagine there were
some places where people weren't there to actually be able to execute payments,
and other customers are beginning to get a little bit skittish with their
payments as well. So that's really the major story for the quarter. And we
absolutely are going to do all the things Darius described on working capital,
including readjusting our supply plans to these new realities from the
standpoint of our inventory plan, and that's going on as we speak.

OPERATOR: And next, we'll hear from Julian Mitchell with
Barclays.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe just the first question around the SPS segment. So I
think it's the one segment where it looks like you're guiding for a narrower
decline perhaps in the second quarter year-on-year versus what was seen in the
first quarter. Just wanted to check that's correct.

And then within that, understood that Intelligrated is a
swing factor going from minus to plus year-on-year in Q2. Maybe help us
understand your assumptions about the rest of SPS in terms of safety and the
rest of productivity solutions. And whether what you're seeing already in April
does tally up with that down over 5% guide.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, on SPS, I mean, you think
-- should think about a couple of businesses accelerating for the couple of --
next couple of quarters, one being Intelligrated. I mean our backlog there is
tremendous and continues to grow. So that's -- we expect to see growth in
Intelligrated. Obviously, the demand on e-commerce is going to become more
acute, not less acute. And we have orders positions in the backlog. And even
our front log, that looks extraordinarily appealing. So that's a business.

Obviously, we've captured a tremendous amount of business in
PP&E (sic) [PPE]. It's -- and that business is going to accelerate more or
less every single month as we move forward through the year. So we expect to
see growth. And then modest to -- modest decline in some of the other
businesses, although sensing and IoT, we'll see growth in some of the health
care-oriented sensors. There are other segments that it's exposed to, like
aerospace, that are obviously going to be in decline, so that's going to be --
our productivity products business, kind of low single digit kind of decline is
kind of what we're expecting. Some of those segments are going to do pretty
well: transportation, logistics and health care; retail is not. So that's kind
of how we see that one. So overall, I mean, we do expect SPS for the year to be
our healthiest and strongest SBG. And I think it's -- we could even see growth
in that SBG even this year.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL: Very helpful. And my second question,
maybe just a broader one, not so much Q2, but a broader one around the PMT
segment. That segment managed to ride the '15, '16 energy downturn remarkably
well. Just wondered if you saw more pressure maybe in this downturn versus that
one because of the aspect around gasoline consumption being down in different
markets and maybe more pressure as well in Process Solutions because of extra
mid and downstream CapEx cuts. And how much of the fixed cost out, maybe
something from Torsten on that, can help in PMT offset this severe revenue
drop?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. PMT is going to be challenged for
the segments that are oil and gas-oriented. And obviously, we have exposure in
both UOP and HPS. I remember the '15, '16, because I ran that business at that
time. It wasn't that much fun. But I do worry about a couple of factors here.
The first one is there's just no demand. I mean, if you think about what comes
out of refineries, whether it's jet fuel, whether that's gasoline and so on,
the world needs to go back to work and start functioning again because no one
is flying, very few countries in the world are reopening. So there's very
little gasoline and fuel consumption. Price of oil is highly depressed. If you
look at -- if I remember correctly, the lowest price of oil that I seem to
recall back in the '15, '16 time frame, it was about $27, $28 a barrel. We're
substantially south of that.

So it's going to be a challenging time for PMT. And we're
going to be taking some -- we already are taking and will be taking even more
cost reductions to align with the demand. And you even heard some recent
announcements as early as today with Exxon and Chevron further cutting back
CapEx. So we have to adjust to the reality of today and focus on a lot of our
services and a lot of our digital business to drive growth and the segments
that are still growing because we do participate in the pharma segment. We have
some play in food and beverage, pharmaceuticals and so on. So it's not all doom
and gloom. But clearly, it's going to be a challenged time for PMT for a
portion of that business, not the entire business. And we have to align to that
reality and adjust our cost base to what we anticipate it will be.

OPERATOR: Next, we'll hear from Jeff Sprague with Vertical
Research.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER & MANAGING PARTNER,
VERTICAL RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: Just a couple quick ones from me, if I could.
First, just back on the cost reduction actions. The $375 million to $500 million
of restructuring actions is the same figure that you used back in January, but
now we're looking at this additional $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion of cost of
which 60% to 70% is structural. So it would seem to me that, that does require
a heavier lift on actual restructuring spend. So could you just kind of line
that up for me? And then provide a little bit more color on what the phase 2
might actually be?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Sure. So Jeff, a couple of things.
Number one, the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, about $200 million of that is
carryover restructuring from the prior year. So it's not 100% incremental. And
you're right, I mean, we guided a pretty sizable repositioning capacity as we
always do, because we're always building pipeline around repositioning. That's
been one of the things that's continued to feed our productivity delivery over
many, many years. And so what you're seeing here is we just accelerated a
substantial amount of that into the first quarter and the second quarter,
mainly to drive direct and indirect cost reductions to combat this situation.
So that capacity has always been there to deal with the pipeline as it gets
created. We've just now deployed it or about to deploy it into some very
specific things around direct and indirect cost reductions in the near term.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. And then maybe just one other thing
to add to that is a portion of that cost savings is also in indirect costs. As
we think about 2021, obviously, as you reduce your indirect cost, that doesn't
require really much, if any, restructuring. So we don't anticipate going back
to 2019 indirect spending levels in 2021. That's probably not realistic. So
part of that savings that we'll see is going to live through in 2021. It's
going to be someplace between what we're going to come back in 2020 and what it
was in 2019. So part of that is going to be a carryover.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: And when we think about this phase 2,
is this things that you had really already on the shelf Torsten was working on,
and this is also just a significant acceleration? Or are you -- does this
reflect kind of a new, broader reevaluation of just your cost structure and the
current situation.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No. I mean, look, we wanted to do, back
all the way in the March time frame, is react quickly and decisively because
the world really changed in the month of March. So our phase 1 plan was things
that we could do very quickly, very decisively, some moving up some
restructuring, some of the reduced work weeks...

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Ramping down...

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Pay reductions, all those kinds of
things. The phase 2 stuff is because we don't think that things like Aerospace
are going to return to normal next year. I mean I don't know if it's a 2-year
window or 3-year window. You've heard others opine on that, but I don't think
that that's a short term. So particularly in Aerospace and PMT, we're going to
have to align our cost base to the realities of what we're likely to experience
in 2021 and hopefully not beyond but maybe beyond. So phase 2 is, I would say,
a further realization of what the markets may look like in the future and our
realignment of cost base, more of a permanent realignment to adjust to that
reality.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: Perhaps just another, really quick
follow-up, just on aero. You gave us the flight hour numbers. I mean,
typically, we think of some kind of multiplier to that. Can you maybe give us a
little color on just what the last 6 weeks have looked like in aftermarket? I
would assume it's tracking down more than those flight hour declines, but hard
to tell, obviously, from my seat.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. I would say, Jeff, from an
aftermarket perspective, it's definitely accelerated in the first -- I would
say, the last 6 weeks, for sure. I mean the end of March, in particular,
started to see some pretty substantial slowdown. So when we think about it in
the second quarter, we're going to have some substantial reductions probably
greater than the flight hour reductions that I mentioned earlier in the
discussion. So probably greater than 50% types of aftermarket, down in -- in
the ATR segment in particular.

OPERATOR: Next, we'll hear from Nigel Coe with Wolfe
Research.

NIGEL EDWARD COE, MD & SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, WOLFE
RESEARCH, LLC: I think this is a question for Greg, but this is strategic as
well. But obviously, you've got a fair amount of exposure to some fairly
distressed customers, airlines, commercial aero customers, refineries, et
cetera. So how are you thinking about flexibility, credit risk and also
pricing? Are you seeing significant concessions on pricing or requests for
pricing concessions? And then how are you dealing with that?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. Yes. So I can tell you that we are
in active dialogue with our customer base, and particularly in those 2
segments, as you mentioned. Because they are hurting. So they're -- customers
are coming back to us and talking with us about ways in which we can work
together to ensure that they're able to navigate through this environment. And
so we're going through what you would expect a disciplined company to do. We're
doing not only direct dialogue with some of those larger customers, but we're
also doing a substantially deeper credit risk assessment on our whole
portfolio. And in cases where we need to do things like pay before shipments or
require cash before orders are taken, we're doing it. But we've got a -- that's
a nuanced strategy because you've got to be -- you have to have consideration
about the strategic customers that you're dealing with.

So that's -- it's an ongoing activity. I will tell you that
it's got the senior-most leadership attention. These are not decisions that are
being taken down in low levels of the organization. Each of the SBG presidents
and CFOs, and Darius and myself are having direct dialogue on some of these
larger customers, in particular. So it's going to be a challenge. There's no
doubt about it. I don't think we've seen the impact in the markets yet of what
could happen from a solvency risk standpoint. And I think that's yet to play
out. But we're taking appropriate actions, as you would expect us to go do to
manage through that.

NIGEL EDWARD COE: That's great. And then a follow-on to
that. A lot of companies have pulled their earnings guidance, but some have
opined on free cash flow. And obviously, the biggest input to free cash flow is
earnings. But can you just maybe describe some of the levers you're pulling on
working capital and some of the initiatives to maybe drive free cash flow
conversion higher over the balance of this year?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. I mean the 2 biggest areas we're
focusing on, as you can imagine, is inventory and receivables. So we've got
full-court press on with our receivables teams and the SBGs, as I mentioned, to
make sure that our collections activities are robust. And then Torsten and his
team, as Darius highlighted, have instituted a weekly executive [SAP], all the
way to the Honeywell level. And that's going to be a big focus for us, and I'll
let maybe Torsten say a few words about what we're doing there.

TORSTEN PILZ, SENIOR VP & CHIEF SUPPLY CHAIN OFFICER,
HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Yes. I mean the main focus area is to make sure
that we follow demand very, very closely and be very reactive and fast in our
actions. I think that's the main change that we instituted over the last couple
of weeks.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: One other thing, Nigel, though. I will
tell you, though, that we are not planning on cutting growth CapEx. We're in a
strong cash position. Those projects are high-return projects. I'm not planning
on sacrificing the future just to cut back on CapEx. And I -- that's probably
something that we're going to continue to fund.

OPERATOR: And next, we'll hear from Deane Dray with RBC
Capital Markets.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY, MD OF MULTI-INDUSTRY & ELECTRICAL
EQUIPMENT, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Great. I appreciate hearing
all the specifics on the Honeywell's COVID responses. And maybe just to pick up
right where you left off, Darius, if you could. You said you wouldn't cut
growth CapEx, but will there be any cuts to CapEx on the maybe maintenance
CapEx? And could you size that for us, please?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean there might be because,
obviously, we're not operating our facilities as much as we used to do. Some of
them are operating at reduced work hours, obviously, to align with some of the
volumes that we're seeing. Obviously, the maintenance budgets might be a bit
smaller somewhat. There might be some trims around some of the maintenance
budgets, just -- that's totally aligned to production. But -- so there'll
probably be some modest reductions in CapEx, but we are not planning on
reducing investments in future growth and future NPI projects.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. And the N95 masks is a good example.
I mean, you can imagine we're putting capital to work right now to go do that.
So again, absolutely going back and scrubbing our capital plan and making the
appropriate adjustments. But to Darius' point, I mean, growth is going to
continue to be funded.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: That's real helpful. And then just last
one for me. If we could talk a bit about potential secular changes. It might be
a bit too early, but there's been a lot of discussion about reshoring and
specifically, shortening supply chains and some of the sensitivities there.
You've obviously responded with the increase in the N95 masks. But since we
have Torsten here, maybe we can hear about how Honeywell is responding? Do you
think reshoring of supply chains are -- is something that will be a meaningful
driver? And how is Honeywell getting positioned?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think it is a little bit too
early to tell at this juncture as to what we'll do. But you have to remember
that our strategy always has and is kind of a regional-for-regional or
local-for-local production change. I mean, if anything, I'd like to accelerate
that. I'd like to be really local-for-local. I mean, we're mostly there. And I
think that's still very much the right strategy. You got to produce in the
countries in which you operate and leveraging those supply chains and operate
locally. So I'm not sure that's a dramatic change from where we have been. If
anything, it's probably an acceleration of the strategy that we already had.

OPERATOR: Next, we'll hear from Peter Arment with Baird.

PETER J. ARMENT, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD
& CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Darius, Greg, Mark. Darius, and
thank you for everything you're doing regarding all the masks and the PPE
stuff. It's really great. Just maybe a question on Aerospace, just to circle
back, more of a higher-level question. But just you -- the installed base of
equipment, and given the aftermarket is so important, you've always been kind
of representative of kind of the global fleet in terms of an installed base.
How are you thinking about like aftermarket beyond this? I mean do you think
there's going to be some structural impairment because of the heavy
retirements? Probably an unfair question, but I just figured I'd give it shot.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, I think a lot of that depends
upon how quickly we think the air traffic will return, and there's a little bit
of a trade-off. Will airlines want to dispose with cash to acquire new
aircraft? Or will they want to operate their current fleet to maintain cash
flexibility and retain those cash. So I -- and then also the timing matters,
too.

So is that something we're thinking about? Sure, absolutely,
exactly. There's kind of 2 different theories: One theory is you retire more
aircraft and bring in new ones, okay, because of the efficiencies and so on.
That makes sense. But another theory is, okay, you may not want to necessarily
as an airline, part with a lot of cash and further pend it right now when
you're in cash distressed state. So we'll see which way it goes.

I think the most important thing to remember, and we're
spending all our time and energy is providing solutions for airlines and even
airports in terms of how we can regain passenger confidence to fly again.
Because when people sits -- are sitting at home and we probably start opening
up the economies, the single-most important thing that can happen for this
industry is people gaining the confidence to fly again. And that's really where
we're spending our time and energy.

OPERATOR: And next, we'll hear from Josh Pokrzywinski with
Morgan Stanley.

JOSHUA CHARLES POKRZYWINSKI, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY,
RESEARCH DIVISION: First question. Yes. Can you hear me?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes.

JOSHUA CHARLES POKRZYWINSKI: All right. So I guess first
question, impact on -- of customer shutdowns and kind of the inability to do
service or get on-site with some folks. I appreciate that we're still kind of
operating in some of these loose bands. But relative to that, down greater than
15%. How much of that is just kind of an inability to get the work done,
whether it's in a building or refinery, et cetera?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes, Josh, it's actually -- it's really
hard to parse it and be able to say for sure. I mean we think we probably lost
2 to 3 points of growth in the first quarter due to some of these issues. And
to be honest, it's not like I know what they're going to be. Until people
movement becomes freer, we're going to struggle with service and project
execution in the solutions businesses. While social distancing norms become
clearer in the factories, that's going to have an influence over capacity and
attendance and so on. But it's near impossible for us to put a number on that,
which is partly why we shared the greater than -- down greater than this type
of a number as opposed to some level of precision because it's changing almost
daily, and it's different in every region of the country. It's going to be
different in certain states in the U.S. So I wish I could provide you something
more precise but frankly, that's part of the reason why our level of visibility
is precluding us from giving more precise guidance.

JOSHUA CHARLES POKRZYWINSKI: Understood. And then just a
follow-up on Jeff Sprague's question on the aftermarket versus flight hours. If
I think about past downturns in air traffic, any cannibalization risk that
comes out the other side and kind of delays that recovery in your business
relative to flight hours? Or do you tend to move in lock step in both
directions? I know everyone's product portfolio kind of lends itself to
different exposures on that.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, I think there's just a lead lag
effect, right? I mean, I think there is clearly a correlation on the
aftermarket to the flight hours flown, both on the BG and air transport side.
There's probably a little bit of a delay in terms of recurrence and growth in
flight hours and -- than being exhibited in the aftermarket consumption. But
other than that, I think that correlation is generally there. And as you see
flight hours return, whether it's in the business segment or air transport, you
should start to see aftermarket return, probably with some lagging effects.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. I think as you described earlier,
Darius, the bigger variable will be the new plane-old plane situation. If
people are buying lots of new planes, that's going to have a different effect.
If they're running the older equipment and not taking new deliveries, that's
going to affect that as well. So these are some of the variables that we'll
have to see how they play out here over the coming quarters.

OPERATOR: And we'll take our final question from Joe Ritchie
with Goldman Sachs.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Hello, Joe?

OPERATOR: Okay. And then we will hear from Sheila Kahyaoglu
with Jefferies.

SHEILA KARIN KAHYAOGLU, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Darius, on HBT, a large portion is exposed to commercial
construction. What are you hearing from your customers in terms of service
versus products? How are they doing? How do you think about a recovery? I think
you noted you think it's a short-term demand issue. Do you think we see any
sort of structural change for commercial demand?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No. I mean to answer your second
question first, I don't see any structural change for commercial demand. I mean
I actually think there is an opportunity of our HBT business because what CEO
of any commercial building isn't going to want to provide a safer, cleaner
environment for his or her employees. So I think that in terms of overall
commercial construction, I don't see any structural change.

Short term is a little bit tougher to predict because as you
can imagine throughout the world, you have different rules and regulations,
some regions, some states, some countries are allowing construction to keep
going. Others have put more tight restrictions, and it's not allowed. And as
the world kind of comes back, we're going to have a little bit better
visibility and actually access, both to service some of these buildings as well
as to products and solutions. So it's a bit of a mixed story, but it's more or
less realigned to the world kind of returning to some level of normalcy. And
it's really varied throughout the world in terms of -- in some places,
construction is moving. Others, it's in a paused state.

SHEILA KARIN KAHYAOGLU: And then I guess my second question,
maybe can you talk about what sort of recovery you're starting to see in Asia
and China by segment? How quickly are some of these businesses coming back?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think it's a little bit of a
mixed story, and maybe I'll use China as an example. So as you can imagine, in
China, January and February were extraordinarily slow, that the business was --
there wasn't really much of anything happening. March was better. March, we saw
a bounce back, which was encouraging. But April has been, no, not horrible, but
soft. I mean think about negative, single-digit kind of business. So I think
the assumption that China is back to normal, at least based only on the April
data point, may not be correct.

Aviation is just starting to pick up in China. And this is a
little bit of what I talked about before, which is we have to get the passenger
comfortable to fly again. Because just because you lift some of the restrictions,
that doesn't mean that people are going to jump on airplanes the second day
after that. So there's got to be a real level of focus and effort to make sure
that they come back. And that's what we're working with a lot of our airport
and airline customers on some of the solutions. And we have some really good
ideas to help them think through that.

OPERATOR: And that concludes today's question-and-answer
session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius
Adamczyk for any additional or closing remarks.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: I want to thank our shareowners for
their continued support of Honeywell. These are challenging and uncertain times
for all, and we remain focused on continuing to perform for our shareowners,
our customers and our employees. While we cannot predict how the COVID-19
pandemic will ultimately impact our business and the global economy, we are
well positioned to weather the storm with our balanced portfolio, track record
of execution and strong balance sheet. We have managed through uncertain times
before, and we'll do so again.

While 2020 will be challenging, I continue to be excited
about the future for Honeywell. Our operational rigor will serve us well given
the near-term economic outlook. Thank you all for listening, and please stay
safe and healthy.

OPERATOR: Thank you. That does conclude today's
teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful
day.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
Honeywell's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As
a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's
conference, Mark Bendza, Vice President of Investor Relations.

MARK BENDZA, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank
you, Abby. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Fourth Quarter 2019
Earnings and 2020 Outlook Conference Call. With me here today are Chairman and
CEO, Darius Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,
Greg Lewis.

This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP
reconciliations, are available on our website at 

. Note that elements of this
presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view
of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can
change, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the
principal risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance in our annual
report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.

For this call, references to adjusted earnings per share,
adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate
exclude the impacts from separation costs related to the 2 spin-offs of our
Homes and Transportation Systems businesses in 2018 as well as pension
mark-to-market adjustments and U.S. tax legislation, except where otherwise
noted. Comparisons are to the prior year period unless otherwise noted.

This morning, we will review our financial results for the
fourth quarter and full year 2019, discuss our full year 2020 outlook and share
our guidance for the first quarter of 2020. As always, we'll leave time for
your questions at the end.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO,
Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, CEO &
PRESIDENT, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning,
everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. We are very pleased with our results in 2019.
We finished a great year of another strong quarter. In the fourth quarter, we
delivered $2.06 adjusted earnings per share, above the high end of the guidance
range; 130 basis points of margin expansion; and maybe most importantly, $2.3
billion of adjusted free cash flow, resulting in a fourth quarter conversion of
154%.

With this conclusion to the year, we met or exceeded our
financial commitments on all metrics in 2019, managing through a volatile
environment and delivering adjusted earnings per share of $8.16, $0.06 above
the high end of our initial 2019 guidance. Despite the challenging broad macro
environment in 2019, we grew organic sales 5%, driven by strength across -- on
much of our portfolio throughout the year. Growth was driven by Commercial
Aerospace, Defense, Process Solutions and building products.

We also had strong orders for HPS megaprojects, UOP
equipment and Defense and over 100% increase in calibrator orders during the
fourth quarter. These robust orders contribute to a 10% year-over-year increase
in long-cycle backlog. Additionally, in 2019, Honeywell Connected Enterprise
drove double-digit software growth. We expanded segment margin 150 basis points
or 70 basis points excluding the impact of the 2018 spin-offs, both 10 basis
points above the high end of our 2019 guidance.

Our growth, combined with productivity rigor and commercial
excellence, drove margin expansion in Aerospace, Building Technologies and
Performance Materials and Technologies. We generated $6.3 billion of adjusted
free cash flow for the year, exceeding the high end of our initial guidance by
approximately $300 million and resulting in 105% free cash flow conversion or
114% free cash flow conversion, excluding pension income.

We continue to make smart investment in our businesses,
people and communities. We deployed $7.8 billion of capital in 2019 across
share repurchases, higher dividends, high-return CapEx and 2 acquisitions,
including Rebellion Photonics, a provider of innovative, intelligent visual gas
monitoring solutions, which we closed in the fourth quarter. This also included
over 10 investment by Honeywell Ventures for over $50 million deployed in 2019,
bringing our total venture investments to date to over $75 million. We continue
to have a robust pipeline of M&A opportunities with significant balance
sheet capacity deployed.

We launched a new brand campaign to highlight some of the
most exciting innovations, and were ranked #13 on Forbes Magazine's list of the
World's Most Reputable Companies for Corporate Responsibility.

Lastly, we continue to make progress in our breakthrough and
transformation initiatives, which I'll cover next in more detail.

Let's turn to Slide 3. We continue to make significant
progress on 3 key initiatives in support of our transformation to a
software-industrial company. In 2019, we commercialized Honeywell Forge
enterprise performance management software, which helps companies in a variety
of industries gather, gain insights from and ultimately autonomously control
their operations to drive efficiency and safety. Honeywell Forge helped drive
double-digit Connected Software growth this year.

Additionally, HCE is leading the transition to more
recurring revenue models across the company, has delivered key wins and
stronger customer relationship throughout 2019 and will continue to drive
growth across Honeywell, including a 20% Connected Software growth --
compounded annual growth rate over 5 years.

We also made great strides in our Integrated Supply Chain
transformation. We established supply-based management strategy for 11
categories across the enterprise, enabled our businesses to take actions to
substantially reduce their distribution and manufacturing footprint; drove
improvements in sourcing productivity; and in the fourth quarter, we began
seeing broad improvements in our inventory. We are on track to achieve our
long-term targets, including $0.5 billion of run rate benefits and a $1 billion
reduction in inventory.

On Honeywell Digital, which is foundational to running
Honeywell with data-driven decision making, we have matured our data management
practices, digitized key processes through the deployment of new technology
platforms, rationalized over 500 software applications, cleansed 5.2 million
critical master data records, eliminated 20 ERP systems and reduced websites by
58%. When complete, we expect our digital transformation to deliver $0.5
billion of run rate benefits across sales, productivity and working capital
improvements.

We are very pleased with the progress we've made with each
of our transformation initiatives in 2019, and we'll continue to build on this
momentum in 2020 as we transform into a software-industrial.

In summary, we had a terrific 2019, both in our short-term
operating performance and longer-term transformation agenda, and we're setting
ourselves up for a strong 2020 and beyond.

Now let me turn it over to Greg on Slide 4 to discuss our
fourth quarter results and provide our 2020 outlook.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS, SENIOR VP & CFO, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thanks, Darius, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth
quarter, we grew organic sales by 2%, driven by 7% organic growth in Aerospace
as well as continued growth in our Process Automation, UOP and Building
Management Products businesses. SPS contracted during the quarter, but the
turnaround in productivity products is progressing.

Intelligrated sales improved sequentially, though they were
down year-over-year as expected due to tough comps compared to nearly 50%
growth in the fourth quarter of 2018. Importantly, orders were up 100% as the
major project orders we anticipated in Intelligrated materialized to set us up
well for 2020.

Our organic growth, combined with commercial and operational
excellence and the benefits from the portfolio enhancements that we made in
2018 drove segment margin expansion of 130 basis points with segment margin
again exceeding 21% this quarter. Excluding the favorable impact of the
spin-offs, segment margins expanded by 90 basis points, which was 40 basis
points above the high end of our guidance, driven by our strong commercial
excellence and productivity programs.

We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.06, up 11%,
excluding the impact of the spin-off, and above the high end of our guidance.
In addition to strong segment profit performance, earnings per share benefited
from lower share count due to our buyback program and a lower adjusted
effective tax rate which more than offset our planned lower pension income.

During the quarter, we generated $2.3 billion of adjusted
free cash flow with conversion of 154% on the strength of improvements in
working capital primarily from cash collections and inventory reductions. As
Darius highlighted, we're beginning to see the effects of our supply chain transformation
as demonstrated by inventory improvements in the fourth quarter. This resulted
in full year adjusted free cash flow of $6.3 billion and conversion of 105%,
above the high end of our guidance range.

We continued to execute our capital deployment strategy in
the fourth quarter. We deployed $644 million to dividends and $750 million to
repurchases of Honeywell shares, bringing the total share repurchase for the
year to $4.4 billion, resulting in a 3% share reduction, which is above the
commitment of at least 1% share count reduction that we highlighted at the
beginning of the year. We also completed the acquisition of Rebellion Photonics
and funded 2 additional Honeywell Venture investments.

Now let's turn to Slide 5 and talk about the segments.
Starting with Aerospace, sales were up 7% on an organic basis and orders were
up double digits, finishing an outstanding year for the business overall.
Defense & Space grew 9%, led by increased aftermarket volumes on key U.S.
DoD programs and global demand for guidance and navigation systems. Backlog for
Defense & Space is up double digits.

Additionally, demand for Honeywell Forge drove double-digit
JetWave growth in Defense. As you'll recall, we launched JetWave for military
platforms in 2018, and we continue to be excited about the connected growth
opportunities there.

In Commercial OE, sales were up 4% organically, driven by
increased deliveries across major OE business aviation platforms, partially
offset by lower air transport sales. Commercial Aftermarket grew 6%
organically, driven by strong demand in air transport while business jet
aftermarket sales were approximately flat.

Aerospace segment margin expanded 270 basis points driven by
productivity, commercial excellence and strong aftermarket volumes. 2019 was
another outstanding year for the Aerospace team.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were down 11% on
an organic basis driven by lower sales volumes in productivity products, the
impact of major systems project timing in Intelligrated and lower demand for
personal protective equipment. SPS segment margins contracted 330 basis points
year-over-year to approximately 13%, similar to prior quarters, as a result of
the volume deleverage in productivity products and personal protective
equipment.

Within our Intelligrated warehouse automation business, as
we expected, sales were down double digits due to difficult comps and the
timing of several major systems projects. 4Q and 1Q are the 2 most difficult
quarters that Intelligrated will face as sales were up nearly 50% in each of
those comparable periods.

As we discussed in our last call, the orders pipeline has
been robust. And for the second consecutive quarter, Intelligrated posted
significant growth with orders up over 100%, which contributed to more than 30%
increase in the backlog year-over-year. This positions the business well for
2020 as these major projects begin to drive growth starting in the second
quarter and beyond. Importantly, Intelligrated's aftermarket service businesses
continued to benefit from our large and growing installed base with strong
double-digit sales growth for life cycle support and services.

In productivity products, we continued to see distributor
destocking, but inventories are now approaching normalized levels, and we expect
the business to return to growth in 2020. We have taken significant actions to
address the challenges in this business as we have discussed previously. And we
are seeing improvements in our commercial operations as a result, which is
reflected in the sequential sales growth compared to the third quarter of 2019.
We're optimistic that we'll continue to see further improvements in the
business throughout 2020.

In the safety business, organic sales for the quarter were
down 5% as continued demand for our gas sensing products was more than offset
by decreased volumes in personal protective equipment and softer demand in the
retail business.

Moving to Honeywell Building Technologies. Sales were up 3%
organically, primarily driven by ongoing strength in commercial fire products
in the U.S., double-digit growth across our suite of building management
products, including double-digit growth in our Connected Software platforms and
growth in security. That was partially offset by Building Solutions sales,
which were down for the quarter as declines in projects, including the energy
savings performance contracts business, offset double-digit growth in the
airport vertical.

HBT's segment margins expanded 170 basis points in the
fourth quarter driven by the favorable impact from the spin-offs of the Homes
business. Segment margins, excluding the impact from spin accretion, were
approximately flat in the quarter as we -- and we expect this to improve in
2020 as we continue to make progress towards our long-term margin targets for
the business.

Finally, in Performance Materials and Technologies, sales
were up 3% on an organic basis. Process Solutions sales were up 6% organically
driven by strength across the automation portfolio in Smart Energy.
Additionally, orders in the automation and products businesses were up double
digits, allowing us to exit the year with a strong backlog, notably in our
global megaprojects business, which was up double digits.

In UOP, sales were up 3% organically with growth in
petrochemical catalysts and our equipment business, partially offset by
declines in gas processing due to fewer domestic cryo unit sales as a result of
the continuation of softer midstream gas processing markets in the U.S. Backlog
was up high single-digits in UOP driven by strong double-digit growth in
equipment, with carries -- which carries lower margins, as you know.

Organic sales in Advanced Materials were down 4% driven by
lower volumes and pricing in fluorine products due to the ongoing impact of the
illegal HFC imports into Europe. Recent estimates suggest that these illegal
imports are contributing annual emissions at least equivalent to that of 3.5
million cars. This means it would take a forest the size of Portugal to capture
all of the illegal emissions.

We continue to actively work in partnership with private
industry, EU regulators and EU member countries to address harmful illegal HFC
imports. Increasing seizures of illegally imported HFCs are encouraging, but
they're not yet meaningful enough reductions to the total illegal imports.
While these efforts are ongoing, we'll continue to experience pressure on HFC
pricing and volumes.

For the remainder of Advanced Materials, electronic
materials grew mid-single digits and packaging and composites was up high
single digits. This was partially offset by softer demand in additives and
chemicals.

So overall, PMT segment margins contracted by 80 basis
points in the quarter driven by Advanced Materials volumes, the mix of catalyst
shipments and higher mix of UOP equipment, partially offset by improvements in
productivity. As we've discussed before, the mix of catalyst sales and
equipment project timing in UOP has an outsized impact on margins
quarter-to-quarter. And for the full year, PMT margins expanded 70 basis
points.

So overall, we capped off the year with a very strong fourth
quarter performance in earnings, margin expansion and cash as well as strong
orders, resulting in a healthy backlog as we enter into 2020.

Now let's turn to Slide 6 and discuss the markets and our
2020 outlook. As Darius mentioned, in 2019, we managed through a challenging
year where trade tensions and the threat and reality of tariffs were a
constant; the uncertainty of Brexit; interest rate policy and indications of a
possible recession, with signals like the inverted yield curve, weighed on
markets. Today, some of those issues have started to resolve themselves with
the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal now in place and a more clear path forward on
Brexit.

But many uncertainties remain as we begin 2020. There's much
more work to be done on the comprehensive long-term agreement between China and
the U.S. Brexit has a conclusion, however, the execution of their exit from the
European Union is yet to play out and ramifications aren't fully known. Tensions
in the Middle East have created the potential for market disruption. The recent
health threat of the coronavirus is developing rapidly, and how it will evolve
is still unknown. And a highly charged election year in the U.S. brings
additional uncertainties for companies to manage through.

In addition to that, we are facing discrete sales headwinds
in Aerospace, as others are, from the 737 MAX production delay in 2020 as
Boeing has continued to recalibrate their expectations for its return to
service and related production schedules. We are aligned with Boeing's most
recent communications that assumes the 737 MAX returns to service roughly
midyear. However, the situation remains fluid.

So while there are perhaps fewer indications of a
broader-based recession today, there remain several challenging and potentially
fast-changing dynamics that create uncertainty in the macro and caution in our
short-cycle business outlook. With these factors, short-cycle outcomes for the
year will be difficult to forecast, and you'll see that we have a wider EPS
guidance range than is typical for us due to the range of outcomes that could
result.

Our outlook assumes the Middle East remains relatively
stable and that we can continue to deliver backlog and obtain new projects in
the Middle East. We are assuming monetary policy remains stable and interest
rates don't rise, lending support to the economy, and that the U.S. election
does not delay investment. We have not estimated a material impact if the
coronavirus becomes more significant, which is already impacting aviation, in
particular flight hours, and could also have a broader negative impact on
supply chains in the economy as was experienced with the SARS outbreak.

We've incorporated the latest communicated build rates, as I
mentioned, of the 737 MAX into our own revenue outlook, so knock-on effects of
the overall aero supply chain are yet to play out.

So while we have confidence in our market positions and have
prepared ourselves for the year ahead, it's setting up as an equally and
perhaps more uncertain year than the one we just completed. Given that, let's
move to Slide 7 and discuss the markets and the segment outlook.

Starting with Aerospace. Defense remains strong driven by
stable budgets, and we expect growth again in 2020, but at more moderate levels
relative to the strong double digits we experienced in 2019. We continue to see
healthy demand in business aviation, but we will have tougher comps in the
business aviation OE. We expect aftermarket demand across Commercial Aerospace
will continue to grow driven by flight hours and retrofit modifications and
upgrades as well as the impact of older equipment remaining in service as a
result of the delays in the MAX. That will partially be offset by the ADS-B
phaseout.

However, Aero will have sales headwinds from the MAX
production delays. We're taking actions to try and mitigate this impact as best
we can, including leveraging recent improvements in our supply base to
accelerate production from our backlog, and we continue to monitor the MAX
situation closely, as you would expect. Additionally, the impact to our
earnings potential due to the MAX will be somewhat muted as the potential
aftermarket offsets, with their higher profit levels compared to OE sales, will
provide some support for segment margins.

As a result of these dynamics across Aerospace, we're
expecting organic sales to be up low to mid-single digits for the year as
compared to the high single digits in the fourth quarter and the double-digit
growth we experienced in the first 3 quarters of 2019.

Now turning to SPS. We expect strong e-commerce and
warehouse distribution macro trends to continue as customers seek and implement
differentiated warehousing solutions to meet increased demand. These dynamics
contributed to the robust Intelligrated orders in the second half of 2019 that
will fuel warehouse automation sales growth in 2020. And we continue to expect
strong services growth from our expanding installed base.

Excluding the warehousing market, industrial macro indicators
remain weakened, which we expect will result in slower industrial safety,
sensing and IoT sales. Productivity products is executing their recovery plan,
as we mentioned, and we continue to expect a turnaround in 2020 as destocking
ends with the return to growth expected in the second half of the year.

Overall, we expect SPS organic sales to be approximately
flat to up low single digits. And we expect SPS margins to begin recovering in
2020 driven by improvements in productivity products margins, productivity
actions and enhanced growth in software and services.

In HBT, following the spin of our Homes portfolio, our
primary exposure is to the nonresi market, construction market and to the
infrastructure and data center markets. While we're continuing to monitor the
outlook across construction, today, we anticipate nonresidential market overall
to remain flat to up modestly in 2020, and we're expecting HBT organic sales to
be down slightly to up low single digits. We expect strength in commercial fire
and modest growth in security products to continue.

In Building Solutions, we expect continued growth in the
airports vertical, and we are focused on driving services growth to mitigate
the impact of headwinds from lower energy performance contracts and softer
projects orders. Building Management System's strength continues in the near
term and driving better execution and pipeline development to deliver ongoing
growth.

PMT entered 2020 with a healthy long-cycle backlog, up high
single digits in both UOP and HPS driven by robust 2019 orders for UOP
equipment and HPS projects. The oil and gas market outlook is similar to recent
trends with continued softness in the U.S. midstream gas processing market but
continued demand for mega projects.

Finally, with Advanced Materials, we expect continued growth
from Solstice in our Fluorine Products business and better execution in
specialty products. However, the illegal HFC imports into Europe continue to
put pressure on growth, particularly through the first half of the year. Given
these dynamics, in total, we expect PMT organic sales to be flat to up low
single digits for the year.

Overall, the strength of Honeywell is our diversified
portfolio, and we head into 2020 with a healthy long cycle backlog combined
with strong operational playbooks which will enable us to perform in another
tough macro backdrop. Now let's turn to Slide 8 and talk about how these
dynamics come together for our 2020 financial guidance.

We have an effective strategy at Honeywell, which enables us
to continuously deliver on our financial commitments, and that is not changing
in 2020. Our focus continues to be on smart investments for the future, new
product development and breakthrough initiatives to fuel growth, all with
ongoing productivity rigor and commercial and operational excellence to drive
it. These strengths, embodied in our transformation initiatives, position us to
deliver a solid year, even with the unpredictability of the current market
backdrop and uncertain short-cycle macro environment.

For 2020, we expect organic sales growth overall of 0% to
3%, which reflects our balanced portfolio, diverse end market expectations,
headwinds from the 737 MAX production delay and a cautious outlook on our
short-cycle businesses in this environment. We expect to expand margins 20 to
50 basis points for the overall company, consistent with our long-term
framework. Below-the-line pension and OPEB income in 2020 is expected to be
approximately $830 million, about a $200 million increase from the prior year
or $0.20 of EPS, which I'll discuss in more detail in the next slide.

In addition to pension income, other key planning items to
take note of include weighted average share count of approximately [718]
million shares, repositioning charges of $375 million to $500 million as we
continue to fund high-return projects and the remaining below-the-line items to
be in the range of $205 million to $230 million of expense. Combined, this
results in below-the-line income in the range of $100 million to $250 million
for the year.

Finally, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately
21% to 22% for the year.

All in, we're guiding EPS to be $8.60 to $9 per share, up
$0.05 to $0.10 -- up 5% to 10% adjusted, including the $0.20 benefit from
higher pension income.

We expect continued strong free cash flow generation with
adjusted free cash flow of $5.7 billion to $6.2 billion in 2020 driven by
high-quality income growth and continued working capital improvements. Compared
to 2019, we expect approximately $500 million to $600 million of headwinds from
higher planned CapEx investments, an additional payroll cycle due to the
calendar and anticipated environmental and other payments.

This cash generation equates to adjusted free cash flow
conversion of approximately 102% to 107%, excluding pension income. We believe
excluding the noncash pension income impact better reflects our operating
performance and enables more appropriate comparisons to our peers.

We continue to have a strong balance sheet with significant
capacity and desire to do more M&A, as Darius mentioned. We do have a
strong pipeline of opportunities, but in the absence of completing significant
M&A, we'll continue to deploy additional capital to repurchases of
Honeywell shares.

Now let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss our 2020 earnings per
share bridge compared to '19. As I noted earlier, we're providing some slightly
wider ranges than we typically do as a result of the number of variables that
could impact the business over the next 12 months. Segment profit continued to
be a key driver of our earnings growth. Continued productivity improvements,
commercial excellence, volume leverage and ongoing benefits from previously
funded repositioning will contribute $0.10 to $0.45 per share.

We expect our share repurchase program, which has as a base
case the delivery of at least a 1% additional share count reduction, to result
in a benefit of approximately $0.14 per share year-over-year. Our expected tax
rate of 21% to 22% is a range of a $0.07 headwind to a $0.04 benefit to EPS.

Excluding pension income, below-the-line items are expected
to be in the range of a $0.04 headwind to a $0.12 benefit per share, primarily
driven by the range I mentioned on expected repositioning [charges].

The last item is the $0.20 increase from the higher pension
income as a result of high investment returns in 2019 and lower discount rates
in 2020.

Including that $0.20 tailwind, we expect earnings per share
to be in the range of $8.60 to $9, as I mentioned previously.

So I'd like to take a moment just to discuss the pension
dynamics in a little bit more detail. As we've talked about previously, we have
derisked our pension plans. And in 2019, approximately 15% -- 50% of the plan
assets were in more conservative fixed income-like assets, the other half being
in return-seeking assets. As a result of the strong equity markets in 2019,
those return-seeking assets earned approximately 21% in the year, resulting in
over $3 billion of an increase in our pension asset base compared to last year.

This higher asset base, combined with lower discount rates,
is driving higher income in 2020, even with lower rates of return expected. Our
pension is now 110% funded, and we continue to derisk that with approximately
60% of our plan assets now in fixed income for 2020.

So in summary, while we're cautious about the macro backdrop
and the short-cycle outcomes are once again hard to predict, we enter the year
with a healthy backlog in our long-cycle business. We have diversified end
markets, a strong playbook and a solid track record of execution. And we're
prepared to deliver another strong year with growth primarily from continued
segment profit performance and our capital deployment strategy.

Now let's turn to Slide 10 for a preview of the first
quarter. For the first quarter, we expect organic sales to be in the range of
down 2% to up 2% organically, driven by growth in Aerospace, continued strength
in Building Products, UOP equipment and Process Automation, offset by headwinds
from SPS and some of the other short-cycle components of our portfolio.

Keep in mind, Q1 of 2019 was our strongest quarter of the
year and will be our most difficult comp. We expect commercial excellence,
productivity rigor and the benefits from previously funded repositioning to
drive continued segment profit and segment margin growth with 20 to 50 basis
points of year-over-year margin expansion resulting in segment margins in the
range of 20.6% to 20.9% for the first quarter.

In Aerospace, we continue to see demand in both Commercial
Aerospace and U.S. defense, supported by robust orders growth and firm
backlogs, as I've discussed. However, as we've stated, after 5 straight
quarters of double-digit sales growth through 3Q 2019 and high single-digit
growth in 4Q 2019, we expect organic sales growth rate to moderate in 2020.
Aero is facing sales headwinds, as are others, from Boeing's most recent
recalibrations of the 737 MAX production delays, which will contribute to the
more moderate growth rates as we enter the year, although we plan to mitigate
some of that impact by accelerating production from our backlog.

In SPS, we expect distributor destocking to come to an end
in productivity products, although return to growth will likely be a second
half outcome. And we expect slow sales to continue in industrial safety.

Intelligrated sales will be impacted by the project timing I
mentioned in the first quarter due to strong growth of approximately 50% last
year at this time. The growth from robust orders in the second half of 2019
will contribute to more substantial sales growth in the following quarters.

In Building Technologies, we expect strength in commercial
fire and security products driven by demand in the Americas as well as
continued strength in airports. We continue to see infrastructure, including
airports and data center projects, as opportunities for strong growth in HBT.
However, we expect softer project sales in energy and other verticals within
Building Solutions as we begin the year.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, we expect to see
continued growth in products and services, and process automation, and we
expect a healthy demand for equipment in UOP. The headwinds in the Advanced
Materials business from illegal imports of HFCs into Europe and lower specialty
products demand driven by the slowdown in China will persist in the early part
of 2020.

We expect the effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22%
in the first quarter and average share count to be approximately 720 million
shares. All this results in earnings per share in the range of $2.02 to $2.07,
representing growth of 5% to 8% earnings per share.

In summary, well positioned going into the first quarter
with plans in place and ongoing initiatives across all businesses to drive
productivity and margin expansion, to mitigate the impacts of the mixed macro
environment and the headwind of the tough comps compared to a year ago. We also
continue to have significant balance sheet flexibility to generate strong
returns through share repurchases and opportunistic M&A.

With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius,
who will wrap up on Slide 11.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Thanks, Greg. Overall, we're pleased
with the strong operational performance from our portfolio in 2019. We continue
to execute on our core priorities and we again delivered on our commitment.

We remain cautious on the macro environment with many
factors still very fluid for 2020 and significant uncertainty around
short-cycle demand. We have a balanced portfolio poised for continued
performance despite macro headwinds. And we continue to make significant
progress on our transformation initiatives, including Honeywell Connected
Enterprise, Honeywell Digital and our Integrated Supply Chain.

Additionally, we're bringing innovative and connected
offerings to market to fuel growth, which combined with our strong execution
track record, positions us well for 2020 and beyond.

With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.

MARK BENDZA: Thank you, Darius. Darius and Greg are now
available to answer your questions. Abby, please open the line for Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question is
coming from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Just on the free cash. You mentioned a few items. Obviously, stronger
in '19. You mentioned a few items influencing 2020. Kind of disagree with using
an adjusted conversion metric. Ultimately, cash per share is what matters. But
what is the -- is anything kind of flip in '21? So is '20 to be viewed as kind
of the base for growth? Or is there anything timing-wise that was pulled into
'19 that influences '20, and then '21 is kind of a more normal base to grow off
of?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. So we've always talked about our
free cash flow conversion adjusted, and we guided it last year, even in -- and
I believe 95% to 100% adjusted. We highlighted the -- both in our press release
materials, both the way we had done it previously, adjusted. And then we also
adjusted it for pension income, just to be transparent about both of those
metrics, particularly with the increase in pension income going into 2020. So
that's really the -- that's what you're seeing there in terms of -- and both of
those numbers are strongly above 100%.

So in terms of the 2019 into 2020 differences, what I tried
to highlight in the opening, Steve, is really a couple things. And first, we
are going to spend a bit more CapEx as we go into 2020, and that's in support
of our transformation initiatives in the supply chain, some additional capacity
for some new products.

We also have, just from a calendar perspective, and we're
going to have an extra payroll cycle in 2020, so that's just math. And for us
that's, call it, between $100 million and $200 million of headwind that will
come and go in 2020.

And then in terms of our environmental and other
liabilities, those numbers will move a little bit. And so there's probably
$100-ish million, maybe, to $200 million of flex that we have in there for 2020
also. So those are really the major items that you'll see.

But our cash flow performance and the overachievement that
we had in the fourth quarter relative to our own expectations were heavily
anchored around our working capital improvements. We did a tremendous job with
our commercial and collections teams on the receivable side, we've been doing a
lot on transforming how we do credit to collections. And then we've talked
about inventory being our bugaboo for some time now. And if you look at the
free cash flow statement, you'll see for the first time in a while, we actually
were able to get cash from inventory as we're specifically starting to tune
some of those dials in a more disciplined way with, again, some of the things
that Torsten and the team are driving from a transformation perspective.

So Darius, I don't know if you want to add to that.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, just to add a couple things, Steve,
and maybe just to add a couple things on a year-over-year basis. And these are
not dramatic impacts. But overall, our cash outlays are going to be slightly
higher in 2020 versus 2019 due to restructurings. So that's probably another
factor.

I wouldn't get too focused about a baseline of 2020.
Obviously, we have some CapEx to spend, which is the driver in our payment
cycle. That's an extra one, so that's just the math worked out. So I don't
necessarily mean that 2020 now is the baseline.

But I do want to highlight something, and I think it's a
point that's been missed completely, which is if you look at the cash flow
generation of this company versus what it was 2 years ago, we're about $2
billion higher on 15% to 20% in the last sales growth. I think that point's
been just missed completely. And I'm extraordinarily proud of the team in terms
of what they've been able to accomplish in terms of the cash generation. After
all, that gives us more firepower to actually reinvest in the business or pass
back to our shareowners or likely both. And I think that's the thing that
really matters.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. So just -- that makes sense. So
basically, a few hundred million dollars that is kind of timing-related in '20.
Is that kind of how we should think about it at a high level?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. And then one last quick one,
just on HBT. What's going on there with the -- I mean, you guys had a pretty
positive Investor Day and now kind of framing a year with a little bit of a
decline at the low end. What kind of popped up? Is that kind of performance
contracting? I know JCI talked about that as being weak as well. What's kind of
the drag there?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: That's exactly it, Steve. We basically
-- our energy contracts or performance contracts are primarily driven by the
government sector. We've seen a substantial drop off in that segment of the
business, and orders that has not been sort of the focus of the government
sector lately, and that's been a problem. That's been a significant business
for us in the past, and that's dropped off. That's -- the orders there have
dropped double digits. So that's probably the one problem area that we've seen
in terms of orders.

But we're always going to have an issue somewhere. But if we
look at our long-cycle orders for the quarter across Honeywell, 15% growth, I
don't want to sort of bypass that fact, and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7. So I
think it was an incredibly successful quarter from a long-cycle orders
perspective. And just to maybe quote you another fact. A place like China,
orders up north of 20% and backlog up nearly 50%. So I viewed this quarter as
just an outstanding from Honeywell winning in the marketplace.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. One quick one. What's your
year-end share count? And then I'll leave it there, just year-end ending share
count. I'll leave it there.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: I think we talked about [718].

UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [Start to '20]

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes.

OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Scott Davis
with Melius Research.

SCOTT REED DAVIS, FOUNDING PARTNER, CHAIRMAN, CEO &
RESEARCH ANALYST OF MULTI-INDUSTRY RESEARCH, MELIUS RESEARCH LLC: A lot of
information here, and it's super helpful. I think this is the first quarter
where we've, at least for the 2020 guide, where supply chain seems to be a --
starting to become a tailwind. And I guess my question really is, Darius, does
this become a linear tailwind? Meaning you get some benefit in 2020, some in
'21, '22? Or is there some sort of a step-up that occurs over time as you kind
of -- post this investment cycle?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, I think it's a gradual improvement.
I think I was extraordinarily pleased with what we saw in terms of our
inventory management. Inventory has been a bit of a bugaboo for Honeywell for a
long time. And we actually made some really nice progress in the second half of
the year. Now I don't think there are any miracles for us out there. But I
expect that progress to continue, and it was reflected in our cash flow for Q4.
And also, we're focused on our delivery, our quality and so on. And Torsten and
his team are doing a really nice job driving those improvements, and I expect
to see a gradual improvement year-over-year.

And then transformation. I mean, we dropped our fixed cost
footprint in '19. We have an even more aggressive plan for 2020 and 2021. So
you're going to kind of continue to see that progress on fixed cost reduction,
which obviously makes us a much more variable cost company, which is something
that I very much desire.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Yes. Super helpful. And I don't think you
mentioned the word M&A or deals of any course in the prepared remarks. And
was that -- I may have missed it, of course. But was that purposeful in the
context, there's just not a lot, relatively expensive market out there? Or is
it just not part of the planning right now, and deals get announced when they get
announced?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, we did do Rebellion in
December, which isn't a big acquisition, but a really -- an interesting one,
which is basically the use of imaging for advanced gas detection. So it's very
much a technology-oriented company in the industrial segment, which fits
really, really well with industrial safety, but it also fits well with
productivity solutions and our HPS business. So we're very thrilled to get that
one.

In terms of M&A, we continue to be very active, I can
tell you. And the environment we're seeing is, yes, the prices are elevated.
But what I can also tell you is that kind of -- because there's so much cash
awash and so much capital to deploy, we're seeing very aggressive sort of due
diligence and the kind of terms that others are willing to accept. So I think
we're assessing that because we're going to continue to be a very cautious
company and really study the market. But we also have to kind of look within
ourselves in terms of what's risk that's reasonable, what isn't. So it's a very
robust M&A marketplace, and we expect to do deals in 2020, certainly.

OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Julian
Mitchell with Barclays.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe just a first question around the CapEx hike that you
mentioned, it sounded pretty substantial. So maybe give us some idea of how
long capital spending stays elevated. And also in terms of the split of the
CapEx increase maybe between growth-focused or new product initiatives versus
some of those supply chain, internal self-help measures.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Sure. So we've been around $800
million, as you know, for the last couple of years. I think it was like in the
820s or 830s or so. And so when I say elevated, this is not massive increases.
We're talking about 100 -- 100-ish type of increases year-on-year. And I would
say it's probably 50-50 split between increases relative to the transformation
and increases relative to some new capacity for some of our new product
launches that we're doing.

So I wouldn't -- this is not like we're making one massive
block investment in something huge here. But as we go through this
transformation in the supply chain, it's going to require capital. So 50-50, I
would say. And think about it in sort of like 100, 150 type of potential
increase year-on-year.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. And by the way, just to add to
that, the IRR in total on these investments, substantially north of 30%. So I
mean, if you think about that kind of a return versus M&A, whenever we're
going to see those kinds of returns, I'm more than happy to deploy more capital
because it's going to make us a better company in the long term. So I think
that this increase in capital, I think, should be viewed as a positive, not a
negative.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. And again, we talk about our free
cash conversion, just to get back to that for a minute. And we've said many
times, we are not, like, pinpointed on 100. If we've got good investments, and
-- we're going to make them. So.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL: That's helpful. And then my second
question just around Safety and Productivity Solutions, not so much on the
Productivity Solutions piece because I think that's well understood, but maybe
on Safety. That did roll over in the fourth quarter. Just maybe give us some
understanding of -- was that a surprise to you? And what do you think this year
will look like in terms of Safety sales?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think there, it's the
markets. The industrial markets overall have been relatively soft. But we don't
think that there's anything sort of unusual going on in that business. It's a
reflection of that. I mean, it's not -- obviously, it's a market that's
flattish to down. Some of the segments that we play in, we saw that. So this is
probably one -- why we have some uncertainty about the short cycle, right?
That's one of the tougher businesses to call for us.

We are concerned about what's happening in China around
coronavirus and so on. And not just the impact in China, but really the impact
on the global industrial production because these are global supply chains. So
I think you have to look beyond just China. But we're optimistic that the
markets are going to improve, but there isn't inherently something unusual
going on in those -- in that business.

OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz
with Citi.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ, MD AND U.S. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR HEAD,
CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Darius or Greg, just focusing on your Aero
guidance for 2020. To the extent you can, could you elaborate on the headwinds
on -- that you could incur from the MAX, either growth or margin? And
obviously, it's too early to tell the coronavirus impact on commercial
aftermarket but there are a lot of moving parts in that business, whether it's
a brief decline in flight hours or the ADS-B mandate. You've had strong RMUs,
connected initiatives are doing well. So how do you think about the resiliency
of commercial aero aftermarket in 2020?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: So obviously, the -- what Boeing is
doing with the MAX return to service has and will have an impact on the
aftermarket performance. And I think we're all aware they fly the older planes
longer, and so therefore, has increased demand in that sense.

When you think about our guide for what's happening with the
MAX, you should think about we're going to have probably a low to
mid-single-digit headwind to the Aerospace growth because of the production
schedule changes. And so we talked last year about it being rather minimal
because the numbers were smaller. But now with Boeing announcing the stoppage
of production and their midyear return to service and their ramp-up, their
reramp, we are going to be taking down our deliveries to them much more significantly
than we did in the back half of 2019.

So as we talked about, we will try to utilize some of our
other existing backlog. And hopefully, the supply base can provide us some
additional material inputs so that we can defer labor and try to -- and serve some
of our other customers in a way to offset some of that, but it's hard to say
how that's going to work out. That's why we are being a bit cautious because
that's all very fresh news, as you know, within weeks. And so the impact to
even our supply chain is unknown. So...

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. The revenue impact is meaningful. I
mean it's -- think about kind of a mid-triple-digit impact for millions of
dollars. It's -- obviously, we can -- we think we can offset some of that, both
through RMUs and backlog reduction, but it's -- from a revenue perspective,
it's not an insignificant. And by the way, we just -- we're completely aligned
to the Boeing perspective. So it's -- that's what's reflected in our current
outlook.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ: And Darius, you already mentioned
China in Q4 was pretty strong in terms of orders. But maybe you can walk us
around the world, what you did in Q4 and what your expectations are for 2020?
With the understanding that there's uncertainty out there, I think in Q3,
China, U.S., Europe were all strong. You're expecting India to come back. So
what happened to these regions in Q4?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Interesting Q4, I mean obviously,
China was a highlight, both kind of on the orders, growth rate -- and by the
way, China is accelerating for us. So we've seen a higher rate of growth Q2,
Q3, Q4. Q4 was even higher. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing there. The
orders give us -- so actually, China is one of the really nice stories for us.

The other place to highlight, and I think I've talked about
this before, which is Latin America. I mean, Latin America was also up high
single digits. And obviously, we have to be taking a lot of share there given
the fact that those economies aren't exactly robust and they're struggling. So
I'm very, very pleased with what's happened there.

Middle East continues to be a region of strength for us. We
had some tougher comps, but think low to mid single-digit kind of growth rate.

Probably the lowlight for us was Western Europe. That's been
kind of soft in Q4. I think couple of the countries that I'd look to get --
that were particularly soft would be Italy and the Netherlands, which were weak
overall.

India was okay in Q4. Frankly, it was a little bit lower
than we had hoped, low to mid single-digit kind of growth numbers. There's some
-- we have -- that's a country of strength for us, but slightly below
expectations. And Russia actually did quite well for us as well in the segments
that we play in.

So sort of a mixed story, but the highlight certainly being
China both on the actual performance and the bookings growth.

OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Jeff Sprague
with Vertical Research.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER & MANAGING PARTNER,
VERTICAL RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: A couple quick ones from me. Just on the
productivity products, Darius, a little surprised to hear you're not expecting
a return to growth to the back half -- into the back half. The comps are very
easy in the first half. Do you feel like you have the product to actually drive
the business and kind of take a little bit better control of your destiny
relative to kind of just with the noises going on, perhaps, in the channel?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: To be clear, I am expecting a return to
growth in productivity products. So I think we -- I think we've got our signals
crossed someplace there. And just to give you some very specific data points.
The sales out in the channel for productivity products has grown every quarter
last year. We've more or less normalized our channel position now by the end of
2019. We actually saw growth in the scanning portfolio in productivity products
and we've been able to secure a couple of good wins.

The toughest comp still for productivity products is Q1. We
anticipated that. It's not news. But as we get further and further out the
year, I do expect growth in productivity products. So -- and I have the data to
-- that gives me that confidence. So that's not on a wish and a hope. I have
some data points that says that that's a reasonable outcome to expect, unless
of course something goes wrong with the market.

But actually, I'm very pleased with the kind of progress
that's been made, the team that we now have in place and the products that we
have to the marketplace.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: I was just going by Slide 7 there on
the second half. Just thinking about the guide overall. When you read what
you've put on Slide 6, it doesn't sound like you're being super conservative.
But then when you talk and with the width of the range, it does, in a way, feel
conservative. Could you just address that? I mean, 0 at the low end feels
pretty conservative, particularly if you pull out a 0 in Q1, which is your
toughest comparison, right? Then you probably are on a path for something
better than that as the year unfolds.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, Jeff, I think we've been
pretty consistent in our approach in terms of forecasting and outlooks, which
is when I'm not sure of something or myself and Greg are not sure of something,
we're going to give you a wider range. And we're not going to promise things
that we don't either don't have visibility or can't do.

I would also tell you a couple of other things. I mean there
are quite a few unknowns. I mean, coronavirus right now, as an example, is
something that's very difficult for us to predict around the impact. I mean if
things go back and our factories reopen Monday or a week from Monday, which is
kind of the schedule, well then maybe it's conservative. What if they don't?
What if this continues to spread? What if it gets worse? That impact could be
substantially worse than what we're expecting.

The short cycle is a little bit unpredictable. We talked --
there was a prior question, industrial safety. It's tough to call that right
now. As I look at a lot -- the reports from a lot of the shorter cycle-oriented
peers, they exactly have not been stellar. I mean, so we're trying to call it,
I don't know about conservatively. We don't know, and we don't know that much
about short-cycle right now. We're going to kind of err on certainly a little
bit wider range and we'll see what happens. And obviously, like we do every
year, as the year progresses, we'll update you, and we'll refresh our guidance.

I'm very happy with our long cycle. I mean, a 10% growth in
the backlog is very good. So that gives me some confidence. And we'll see how
the year progresses.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: Yes. And on the long cycle, just one
more, if I could. Obviously, projects are normally subject to delays and the
like. But as it stands now, is most of that backlog deliverable in 2020? It's
tied to expected activity in 2020?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No, it's -- some of it is beyond 2020. I
mean we sort of expect a normal conversion cycle. I mean it's -- for example,
some of the Intelligrated backlog, goes all the way into 20 -- yes...

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: 15 months...

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, 15, 18 months. So it's longer
cycle. But nevertheless, I mean, it's -- the makeup of it isn't dramatically
different in terms of execution versus end of 2018. So it kind of looks the
same. It's always more than 1 year. So it's not inconsistent with what we've
seen in the past.

MARK BENDZA: Okay. Abby, I think we will take 2 more
questions.

OPERATOR: Okay. We will take our next question from Nicole
DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.

NICOLE SHEREE DEBLASE, DIRECTOR & LEAD ANALYST, DEUTSCHE
BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes, so my first question is just around you guys
talked about short cycle as obviously another item of uncertainty in 2020. Can
you talk a little bit about what you saw from short-cycle trends in 4Q
throughout the quarter? And was there maybe any signs of like weakening
throughout December and into January that gives you concern into the first
quarter? Or have you seen more like stabilization?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: I would tell you that as we exit the
year, it was relatively stable, but I would tell you that also January with the
China situation is going to be one we're going to have to read into pretty
closely. So no -- I wouldn't highlight a huge problem to solve at this point
just yet. But certainly, there have been some weakening trends as we exited
December and into January in a few places. Again, China, on the short cycle, is
one we're going to watch very closely. Darius mentioned a couple of areas in
Europe in particular as well.

NICOLE SHEREE DEBLASE: Okay, got it. And then secondly, just
around process. If you guys could talk a little bit more about what you're
seeing from a backlog perspective? And areas of strength? One of your big
competitors talked about some big LNG projects coming through recently. So it
would be great to hear where the strength is coming from for you guys.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, I think for us, it's probably
3 main components of strength. By the way, HPS had a terrific quarter, double-digit
orders growth. The business is doing incredibly well. We're thrilled with their
performance. But specifically, LNG is coming through, some of the
mega-refining, petrochemical complexes is another place of growth. And we're
starting to do a bit more in the renewable segment. That's actually one of the
focus areas for PMT in general, and we're seeing some improved activity for --
in renewables. So I would highlight those 3 as areas where we're seeing growth,
with a terrific bookings and orders outlook, in Q4.

OPERATOR: And our next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe
Research.

NIGEL EDWARD COE, MD & SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, WOLFE
RESEARCH, LLC: So yes, we've obviously covered a lot of ground, and I
appreciate all the detail, by the way. Just want to clarify on the payroll
cycle. Greg, you called out $100 million to $200 million. Is that just a cash
impact? Or does that also impact earnings...

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: That's right. Payroll. Yes, payroll.
That's our payroll.

NIGEL EDWARD COE: Right. So is that just cash? Or is it
earnings?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: No, no, that's cash. That's just --
generally at the end of the year, we carry an accrual. The way the calendar
falls that are -- we pay every 2 weeks on a Friday, happens all the time in the
exact same way. Happens that next year, the Friday is going to be right before
the year-end.

NIGEL EDWARD COE: Understood. And then my main question is
on the 20 to 50 bps of segment margin expansion. How does that look by
segments? And the spirit of my question is, should we expect SPS to be sort of
a heavy contributor to that, maybe Aerospace a little bit less? So any color on
that?

And then kind of the subtext here is you're obviously doing
a lot of restructuring this year, up to $0.5 billion in your plan. Is that all
cash? And what kind of paybacks are you getting on that spend?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. So let me unpack that. First of
all, we're not giving segment margin expansion guidance individually. We should
expect, of course, that SPS will improve given the degradation we saw in 2019.
They've obviously got a lot more room to run given that depression we had this
year. The other 3 businesses, I think all have, I'll call it, equal opportunity
on margin improvement overall. So that's the way I would think about that from
a segment perspective.

As it relates to the restructuring, a high percentage of the
restructuring that we have on the balance sheet is cash-oriented. And we do
expect that is going to essentially get carried out over 2.5 to 3 years' time.
As Darius mentioned, a heavy amount of that will be in 2020 and then in 2021
and a little bit of a tail-off into '22.

But as it relates to the projects, you can think about them
really in sort of 2 categories. Those that are really tied to, call it, site
consolidations. Those that are above the cost of capital, clearly, the high
single-digit, low double-digit type returns. Those that are more associated
with, call it, back-office productivity and organizational redevelopment and so
on, those are carrying far higher returns to them. So that's kind of what we
are looking at.

NIGEL EDWARD COE: Great. And one quick clarification on the
share count reduction question. It doesn't feel like you've got a whole lot
dialed in for 2020, about $1.5 billion by my calculations. Is that the right
zone?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes, that's in the ballpark. Again, we
are, at a minimum, going to buy back 1% of our shares for sure. And then as we
discussed, if the year progresses, and we're not seeing a lot of M&A
activity and it looks like an attractive opportunity as we did here in 2019, we
won't be afraid to go back into the market and scoop up some of our own shares.

OPERATOR: That concludes today's question-and-answer
session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius
Adamczyk for any additional or closing remarks.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: I want to thank our shareowners for a
continued support of Honeywell. We remain focused on continuing to outperform
for our shareowners, our customers and our employees.

We have delivered on our commitment of strong results each
quarter and continue to make great progress on our growth and transformation
initiatives. We have a great portfolio, and we continue to execute well.

I'm excited for 2020, and we expect another high-performance
year for Honeywell.

Thank you all for listening, and have a great weekend.

OPERATOR: Thank you. This does conclude today's
teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful
day.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, everyone, ladies and gentlemen, and
welcome to Honeywell's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's
conference, Mark Bendza, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

MARK BENDZA, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank
you, Ebony. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's third quarter 2019
earnings conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Darius
Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis.

This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP
reconciliations, are available on our website at 

. Note that elements of this
presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view
of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can
change, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the
principal risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance in our annual
report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.

For this call, references to adjusted earnings per share,
adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate
exclude the impacts from separation costs related to the 2 spin-offs of our
Homes and Transportation Systems businesses in 2018 as well as pension
mark-to-market adjustments and U.S. tax legislation, except where otherwise
noted. Comparisons are to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted.

This morning, we will review our financial results for the
third quarter of 2019; share our guidance for the fourth quarter; provide an
update to our full year 2019 outlook; and share some preliminary thoughts on
2020 dynamics. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chairman
and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, CEO &
PRESIDENT, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning,
everyone.

Let's begin on Slide 2. This has been a very exciting
quarter for Honeywell, capped off by another strong financial performance and
several important recent leadership changes. I have asked Tim Mahoney, who has
been the President and CEO of our Aerospace segment for the past 10 years, to
serve as our Senior Vice President of Enterprise Transformation. In that role,
Tim will oversee Honeywell Digital, our global cross-functional digitization
initiative that is driving improvements in customer service and efficiency.

Tim's outstanding leadership has enabled Aerospace to
deliver exceptional results. Additionally, within Aero, Tim led the creation of
Honeywell's best digital environment, and I'm looking forward to leveraging
that experience and having his expertise in this crucial role as we continue to
evolve as a software-industrial company.

Taking over for Tim as the leader of Aerospace is Mike
Madsen, who previously led our Aerospace integrated supply chain. Mike has also
served as the President of our Defense & Space business and has held
leadership roles within our Air Transport and Regional business.

Mike began his career at Honeywell. He's had 3 decades of
leadership experience here. We are fortunate to have someone of Mike's
extensive background at the helm of Aerospace.

These appointments are effective immediately, but Mike and
Tim will, of course, work closely together throughout the fourth quarter to
ensure a smooth transition.

In addition, Jeff Kimbell has been named Senior Vice
President and Chief Commercial Officer, who is overseeing our sales and
marketing organizations to drive profitable organic growth. Jeff joins us from
McKinsey, where he's a partner in the transformation practice.

Last, Deborah Flint has joined our Board of Directors as an
independent director. Deborah is the CEO of Los Angeles World Airports, where
she's overseeing the complete modernization of LAX, including championing the
use of IoT technologies. Her deep knowledge of and experience with critical
infrastructure, connected buildings and advanced security solutions will be
invaluable to the Board and our ongoing transformation.

We have the right leadership team in place, a deep bench of
up and coming leaders and an engaged and experienced Board of Directors that
will help us continue to deliver the results you have come to expect from
Honeywell.

Turning to Slide 3, let's discuss a few of our recent
highlights and wins. Through our Honeywell Connected Enterprise, we launched
Honeywell Forge cybersecurity, aimed at helping customers identify and act on
cyber-related incidents. We once again had double-digit growth in total
Connected Software sales as well as continued growth in connected orders during
the quarter.

We announced that Honeywell was appointed by Kuwait
Integrated Petroleum Industries to provide technology and production systems to
the Al-Zour refinery, which will be the largest integrated refining and
petrochemical plant ever constructed in Kuwait.

In addition, Honeywell was ranked 13th on Forbes' 2019
World's Most Reputable Companies for Corporate Responsibility. Our position on
this list is a testament to all we have done and continue to do to be strong
advocates for the environment, our diverse employee base and our communities.

Now on to Slide 4. In the third quarter, we continue to
drive strong financial results, delivering adjusted earnings per share of
$2.08, $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range. We grew organic sales by
3% driven by the strength across Aerospace as well as in our Process automation
and Building Technologies businesses. Aerospace generated double-digit organic
sales growth for the fifth straight quarter driven by our strong positions on
key platforms, robust defense portfolio and ongoing demand for aftermarket
services.

Our long-cycle backlog was up approximate 8% year-over-year
driven by Defense & Space and UOP bookings as well as the strong warehouse
automation orders in HBS projects orders, which each increased over 20% in the
quarter, positioning us well for the remainder of the year and into 2020.

Our organic growth, combined with the benefits of the
portfolio enhancements we have made in 2018, and our operational excellence
initiatives, drove segment margin expansion of 180 basis points, with segment
margin again exceeding 21% this quarter. Excluding the favorable margin impact
from the spin-offs, segment margin expanded 80 basis points, which was 40
points above the high end of our guidance.

During the quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of adjusted
free cash flow, we remain focused on our working capital management every level
of the organization and expect to deliver our cash flow commitment for the full
year. As we've done throughout the year, we continue to execute on our
disciplined capital deployment strategy.

During the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of Honeywell
shares and announced a 10% increase in our dividend, our 10th consecutive
double-digit increase. We also closed 3 Honeywell Venture investments and
completed the acquisition of TruTrak Flight Systems, a leader in autopilots for
the experimental, light sport and certified aircraft.

In the first 9 months of 2019, we have deployed $5.5 billion
to share repurchases, dividends and acquisitions. Additionally, during the
quarter, we issued $2.7 billion of senior notes to refinance October debt
maturities at attractive interest rates, further strengthening our balance
sheet.

I am very pleased with our performance this year, and I'm
confident the team will continue to execute and deliver our full year plan.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg, who will discuss
our third quarter results in more detail and provide our updated full year 2019
guidance.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS, SENIOR VP & CFO, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone.

Let's begin on Slide 5. We posted another strong performance
in the third quarter, building on the great first half in 2019. Aerospace had
another double-digit organic growth quarter. Sales were strong across Process
Solutions, UOP's licensing and refining catalyst businesses and Building
Products.

Honeywell Connected Enterprise drove double-digit growth in
Connected Software. SPS contracted during the quarter, but the turnaround in
productivity products is progressing, and the large order bookings we
anticipated in Intelligrated have begun to materialize, as evidenced by the
over 20% growth in orders during the quarter.

The impact of the spin-offs of Garrett and Resideo in 2018,
both lower-margin businesses at the time of the spin, contributed 100 basis
points of segment margin expansion this quarter. We will lap the favorable
impact of these actions in the fourth quarter. The remaining 80 basis points of
this quarter's expansion was the result of our business performance in
Aerospace, Building Technologies and Performance Materials and Technologies,
partially offset by the year-over-year margin decline in Safety and
Productivity Solutions that we had signaled previously.

Adjusted earnings per share were $2.08, up 9% excluding the
spin-off impact. Adjusted earnings per share excludes a $114 million tax
adjustment associated with withholding taxes in connection with the fourth
quarter of 2017 U.S. tax legislation charge. With that benefit, reported
earnings per share in the quarter was $2.23. I'll talk in more detail about EPS
on the next slide.

Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $1.3 billion with
conversion of 85%. Our total adjusted free cash flow for the first 9 months was
$4 billion, up from $3.9 billion, excluding the spins in the first 9 months of
2018.

Cash conversion for the year has been impacted by the timing
in our projects businesses, primarily in Intelligrated and PMT.

Overall, a very good performance for the third quarter and
above both our margin expansion and our EPS guidance ranges.

I'm now moving to Slide 6 and the adjusted earnings per
share bridge from the third quarter of 2018. Consistent with last quarter, the
majority of our earnings growth, excluding the spins, came through segment
profit improvement, $0.14. That was driven by organic sales growth, continued productivity
improvements realized through our operational excellence initiatives and
savings from previously funded repositioning projects.

Our share repurchase program, with which we have deployed
$3.7 billion year-to-date, has resulted in a 3% reduction in share count from
last year and provided $0.07 of earnings improvement.

Our adjusted effective tax rate was 22%, consistent with
last third quarter and the outlook we previously provided.

Below the line items were a $0.03 headwind this quarter
compared to last year primarily due to lower pension income as a result of the
pension derisking actions we took in 2018 and the higher funding of new
repositioning projects.

We funded a substantial amount of high-return projects, more
than $70 million in the quarter, which will support our continued productivity
focus, transformation and supply chain initiatives and will also help drive
segment margin expansion and earnings growth in a range of macroeconomic
environments.

Overall, third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.06 above the high
end of the guidance we provided in the second quarter. Our
better-than-anticipated performance was primarily from stronger segment profit
in Aero, SPS as well as acceleration of stranded cost removal. The
below-the-line expenses were about $0.03 lower than we had expected, partially
due to benefits from foreign exchange. So in total, EPS grew 9% this quarter,
another great result, adding to our already strong start to the year.

Now let's turn to Slide 7 and discuss the segment
performance. Starting with Aerospace, sales were up 10% on an organic basis,
continuing an outstanding year for the business. Commercial Aftermarket grew 6%
organically with strong demand of both -- across both Air Transport and the
Business Aviation. Defense & Space grew 17% organically led by global
demand for guidance and navigation systems as well as increased aftermarket
volumes on key U.S. Department of Defense programs. Backlog for Defense &
Space is up nearly 20% and more than 2/3 of orders with delivery through 2020
are booked, giving us confidence the business is poised for continued growth
next year.

In Commercial OE, sales were up 7% organically driven by
growth in the Air Transport shipments and continued strength across business
jet platforms. We saw increased deliveries across major OE business aviation
platforms and high demand for components in Air Transport. As we've discussed
previously, we remain aligned to Boeing's stated production schedule for the
737 MAX, and we'll continue to monitor the situation closely. But at this
point, we have not seen and do not anticipate a significant impact to Honeywell
in 2019.

Commercial Aftermarket sales growth was driven by demand
across both Air Transport and Business Aviation, led by growth in Retrofit,
Modifications and Upgrades. In addition, demand for Honeywell Forge for
aircraft drove double-digit JetWave organic sales growth.

Aerospace segment margins expanded 350 basis points driven
by commercial excellence, productivity net of inflation and margin accretion from
the spin of Transportation Systems. The spin contributed approximately 100
basis points to Aerospace's total margin expansion. As a reminder, this is the
last quarter we'll have the benefit of spin accretion in Aero. We expect
Aerospace strong organic sales growth and segment margin expansion to continue
into the fourth quarter.

In Honeywell Building Technologies, sales were up 3%
organically, primarily driven by ongoing strength in commercial fire products
in the U.S., double-digit growth across our suite of building management
products, which was aided by improved supply chain execution and strong demand
for our Tridium Connected Software platform.

Notably, in Europe, the quarter finished stronger than
expected after seeing a soft market in the first 2 months, particularly in
Germany. Building Solutions was flat in the quarter, with projects growth
across both the Americas region and the airport vertical, which were offset by
declines in the energy business.

HBT segment margins expanded 390 basis points in the third
quarter driven by the favorable impact from the spin-off of Homes business. As
a reminder, this is the last quarter we'll have the full benefit of the Homes
spin accretion given that the spin occurred at the end of October 2018.

Segment margins, excluding the impact from the spin
accretion, were up 10 basis points this quarter and have continued to show
improvement quarter-to-quarter since the beginning of 2019. Overall, it was
another good quarter from the HBT team.

Before moving on, I'd like to remind everyone that the
Building Technologies leadership team is hosting an investor showcase event
November 20th to the 21st at our headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Vimal and
his team are going to provide a deep dive into each of the businesses and highlight
its strategy and the technology offerings we bring to the market. I encourage
you to listen to the webcast online.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were up 3%
on an organic basis. Process Solutions sales were up 7% organically driven by
strength across the entire automation portfolio. We saw growth in maintenance
and migration services, gas measurement products and automation projects and
software. Orders and backlog across PMT were both up high single digits with
particular strength in the products businesses -- in the projects businesses
notably seeing some movement in global megaprojects, specifically in Russia and
China, giving us confidence in the momentum of this business.

In UOP, sales were flat organically with growth in refining
catalysts and licensing offset by declines in gas processing due to fewer
domestic cryo unit sales given the software midstream gas processing market in
the U.S. We again saw strong double-digit orders and backlog growth in UOP with
strength in equipment and petrochemical catalysts positioning us well for
growth going forward.

Organic sales in Advanced Materials were down 2% driven by
lower volumes and pricing in flooring products due to the impact of illegal HFC
imports into Europe and weaker end-market demand in specialty products. We are
actively working in partnership with private industry, EU regulators and EU
member countries to address the harmful illegal HFC imports. While these
efforts are underway, we will continue to see pressure on HFC pricing and
volume.

Overall, PMT segment margins expanded by 60 basis points in
the quarter driven by direct material productivity, commercial excellence and
organic growth.

Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were
down 8% on an organic basis due to distributor destocking and fewer large
project rollouts and productivity products and the impact of major systems
project timing in Intelligrated. Segment margins contracted 320 basis points
for the quarter driven by lower sales volumes, which, while down
year-over-year, was 110 basis points better sequentially than the second
quarter. The management team has taken appropriate cost actions to address the
volume deleveraging, mitigating some of the softness this year. It will
continue to realign the cost structure in the fourth quarter as we work through
the revenue challenges.

In productivity products, we continue to make progress in
the commercial turnaround. Channel inventory levels are burning down as
expected and on -- and are on a trajectory to reach normalized levels by the
end of 2019.

In our Intelligrated warehouse automation businesses, as
we've previously mentioned, a large portion is project-based, which results in
uneven growth patterns. Recent market data from Siemens' September semiannual
release highlighted this order contraction in the first half across the
material handling market. They are experiencing high double-digit 29% order
contraction with 2% shipment growth.

Our sales were down double digits this quarter as a result
of the difficult comps and the timing of major systems shifting to the right.
The pipeline of major systems orders we highlighted previously has started to
convert, with orders up more than 20% year-over-year in the third quarter. The
bulk of the sales stemming from these orders will start to show up in 2020.
Intelligrated aftermarket service business continues to benefit from our large
and growing installed base, again, having a strong double-digit growth from
ongoing demand for life cycle support and services.

Moving to Safety. Organic sales for the quarter were flat as
continued demand for our Gas Detection products was offset by decreased volumes
of general safety and personal protective equipment.

So overall, for the portfolio, a strong performance for the
third quarter.

With that, let's turn to Slide 8 to discuss our fourth
quarter outlook and the updated full year 2019 guidance. We've delivered strong
results in the first 9 months of 2019, with higher segment profit and earnings
per share in the third quarter than initially anticipated, and we're seeing
continued strength in several key markets. However, we remain somewhat cautious
on our outlook given the continued uncertainty in the macro environment, and
the full year continues to be solidly on track.

We expect organic growth in the fourth quarter in the range
of 2% to 4%, which will be driven by continued strength in Aerospace &
Defense, coupled with ongoing demand in Building Products and process
automation, supported by a healthy backlog in UOP and continued growth in
Connected Software through Honeywell Connected Enterprise.

We expect continued segment profit and segment margin growth
with year-over-year improvement of 20 to 50 basis points, excluding the impact
of the 2018 spins, resulting in segment margins in the range of 20.7% to 21% in
the fourth quarter.

Let's look at the segment outlook in a little bit more
detail. In Aerospace, we continue to see strong demand in both Business
Aviation and in U.S. Defense, supported by robust orders growth and firm backlogs
for orders with delivery into 2020. We will see tougher comps in Business
Aviation OE and Defense given the double-digit organic sales growth in the
fourth quarter of '18, so we expect the growth to moderate slightly.

In Building Technologies, we expect continued strength in
commercial fire products driven by demand in the Americas, continued strength
in software and increased project growth in High Growth Regions.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, we expect to see
continued growth in products and services and process automation, and we expect
healthy demand in UOP from the strong backlog, particularly in the equipment
business.

The headwinds in the Advanced Materials business from
illegal imports of HFCs will persist into the fourth quarter.

Finally, in SPS, we continue to expect distributor
destocking in productivity products to remain a headwind for the remainder of
2019 from both the sales and segment margin perspective. We expect another very
strong quarter for Intelligrated orders, but sales will again be unfavorably
impacted by the tougher comps and the timing of those major systems rollouts.

The next -- the net below-the-line impact, which is the
difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be
approximately $155 million in the fourth quarter, as we continue to fund
repositioning pipeline.

We expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be between 20%
and 21% in the fourth quarter and the average share count to be approximately
723 million shares.

So now let's move on to Slide 9 and we could talk about our
updated full year guidance. On this slide, you can see the progression of our
guidance throughout the year. We've delivered strong results each quarter,
continue to expand margins and driven adjusted earnings per share growth of
approximately 10% year-over-year, despite some deceleration in organic growth
as the macro environment has become increasingly less stable in the second
half.

Based on our year-to-date results, we're again raising the
low end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.15. We're narrowing
our reported sales range to $36.7 billion to $36.9 billion, with organic sales
growth expected to be in the range of 4% to 5%, reflecting a tougher second
half, but above the midpoint of our original sales guidance this year.

We're raising the low end of our segment margin guidance by
20 basis points to a new range of 20.9% to 21.0%, reflecting the progress we
continue to make in driving profitable growth.

We're also reaffirming our adjusted free cash flow guidance
to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $6 billion as we remain focused on
improving working capital and driving cash throughout all Honeywell businesses.

Our higher full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of
$8.10 to $8.15 represents earnings growth of approximately 10%, excluding the
impact of the spins. This is an increase of $0.08 at the midpoint from our most
recent full year guidance, passing through the third quarter beat of $0.08 as
compared to the midpoint of our third quarter guidance range. This latest
update, an additional $0.15 low-end raise, takes us to a $0.30 raise in EPS
from the low end of our original guidance range of $7.80 to $8.10 at the
beginning of the year, demonstrating the strong progression throughout 2019.

We continue to be confident in our ability to execute, even
in difficult environments, and these updates reflect that. We have planned for
and executed mitigations against externalities, such as tariffs. We've taken
appropriate and targeted cost actions to reduce cost in areas where we believe
the most exposure to macro instability and market weaknesses lie. As a result,
the momentum we built throughout the third quarter and a strong finish in Q4
will carry through for an excellent performance this year.

With that, let's turn to Slide 10 and discuss some of what
we're seeing as we head into 2020. As we head into next year, we're seeing
indicators of strength in many of our key end markets, but economic instability
remains. It's clear the growth outlook for the overall economy will not be as
robust as it has been in 2018 and 2019.

We do see continued demand growth in key industries though
where we have strong positions. Commercial Aftermarket activity will be driven
by increases in flight hours, though at a slower pace. Solid airlines demand,
ramping of platforms that recently entered into service and continued stable
defense budgets. These drivers across end markets in Aero -- these drivers
across end markets position Aero well for good growth in 2020, albeit moderately
-- at more moderate levels. Our continued focus on productivity, commercial
excellence and our transformation initiatives gives us confidence to sustain
our margin improvement path, though likely at a slower pace than 2019 in Aero.

Nonresidential construction growth, with slight moderation,
should enable continued demand for Building Technologies products and services,
and the product -- and the progress Vimal and team are making in operational
excellence and new product introductions should provide the opportunity for
accelerated margin expansion, continuing the positive trend that we've seen in
HBT through 2019.

In PMT, we expect process automation to continue to grow,
and we've had continued strong orders in backlog growth for UOP, which
positions us well going into next year. Macro data suggesting that the softer
market in the U.S. midstream oil and gas continues, which will affect the gas
processing business. The negative impact at Advanced Materials from illegal
imports of HFCs into Europe, while being proactively addressed, will likely
continue into 2020. We do expect that a growing set of actions that the
European Union is beginning to deploy relative to enforcements, fines and
seizures should result in the slowdown and ultimately, the elimination of the
illegal import of refrigerants into the region.

In SPS, productivity products is progressing on its
turnaround, and we expect to return to growth and margin expansion during 2020.
The second-half build of backlog with major systems project awards for
Intelligrated's warehouse automation solutions will provide a tailwind to
accelerate growth into next year.

And across end markets, we expect Honeywell Connected
Enterprise to continue to drive double-digit Connected Software growth as we
see strong initial demand for our Honeywell Forge offerings, and we'll continue
to launch updates for Forge throughout 2020.

In summary, we're well positioned in key verticals and end
markets with ongoing operational excellence initiatives across all businesses
to drive productivity and margin expansion. We have a robust playbook with
multiple levers to protect profit in the event of a market slowdown and
significant balance sheet flexibility to generate strong returns through share
repurchases and M&A.

Our 3 transformation initiatives, the Connected Enterprise,
integrated supply chain and Honeywell Digital will continue to provide
catalysts for profitable growth. So while 2020 is shaping up to be a
challenging year, we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver. As we
did last year, we will provide more detailed guidance once we close out the
full year of 2019.

With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius,
who will wrap up on Slide 11.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Thanks, Greg. Overall, we are pleased
with and encouraged by the performance from our businesses in the first 3
quarters of 2019. We continue to execute on our commitments to share owners,
are generating strong organic growth in many end markets and have many ways to
further expand margins and grow earnings.

We continue to invest in our businesses' growth initiatives
and deploy capital to generate high returns. Our track record of execution
continues, and we're making progress in our business transformation
initiatives, including Honeywell Connected Enterprise, Honeywell Digital and
supply chain transformation. We still have a lot of work to do with these
initiatives, but I'm pleased with the early progress and the significant
opportunities they provide for Honeywell.

With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.

MARK BENDZA: Thank you, Darius. Darius and Greg are now
available to answer your questions. Ebony, please open the line for Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is
coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.

SHEILA KARIN KAHYAOGLU, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Darius, maybe for you on the Aerospace. Can you talk about
this business a little bit, how you're thinking about it as part of Honeywell
longer term? Does it get bigger or maybe even smaller? I ask this because the
management changed clearly, but I look at 5 quarters of double-digit organic
growth and operating margins close to 27% and I ask myself this. Is this as
good as it gets? So maybe if you could just touch upon that for a second.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, yes, I think it's pretty good. I
mean any time you get double-digit growth, and record margins, well, it's
terrific, but we don't think that, that kind of growth is far from over. Maybe
certainly, we're in a very favorable economic conditions. But as we kind of
look into 2020, we continue to be bullish on this business. The management
change really has nothing to do with the market conditions. I mean I think,
frankly, Tim has a core skill set that's very unique to what he's trying to
accomplish in Honeywell Digital. We're trying to template what was done in
Aerospace because they're substantially more advanced than the rest of
Honeywell. Tim expressed the desire, and I fully agreed and encouraged him to
take on a new role to wrap up kind of his career, and Mike Madsen has been a
terrific leader for decades in Honeywell. So I think that this is kind of a
natural transition. But I wouldn't read into the management changes has
anything to do with the Aerospace market conditions.

When I point to figures such as 60% of our orders already
backlog through 2020, I think flight hours are going to continue. Our
aftermarket business is strong. There's a lot of DGA platforms that our ongoing
production rates are strong. Hopefully, we'll see the 737 MAX return to higher
productions rates and back to service. So I don't see any kind of a doom and
gloom scenario for the Aerospace segment for the foreseeable future. As a
matter of fact, I'm quite bullish on it.

SHEILA KARIN KAHYAOGLU: No, I didn't imply that about Tim. I
think Mike and Tim are probably good partners. And then just upon the Defense
business, do you see that slowing down into 2020? You've mentioned before that
you're trying to sell out for all of 2020. Kind of how do you think about the
growth profile of 40% of Aero?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean yes. I think the tough --
the comps are going to get obviously tougher because you'll have had
double-digit growth for 5 consecutive quarters. But I don't think that there's
-- I'm anticipating any kind of a crash or negative growth. We're still
expecting to grow next year. That's the expectations. Those are already
planned. We're going to provide you more detail in probably 2020. But overall,
the business continues to have levers for growth and also for continued margin
expansion. Because I think something that gets dramatically understated is our
focus on productivity, which you saw on our margin profile this quarter, which
is continue on restructuring, driving Honeywell Digital, ISC transformation,
the power of one on the commercial and fixed cost side. And you see that coming
through in our numbers. So no matter what the market conditions are, that's
part of the Honeywell playbook.

OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from Scott Davis
with Melius Research.

SCOTT REED DAVIS, FOUNDING PARTNER, CHAIRMAN, CEO &
RESEARCH ANALYST OF MULTI-INDUSTRY RESEARCH, MELIUS RESEARCH LLC: One of the
things, you guys just don't mind going around the world a little bit and give
us some more granularity on what you're seeing in specifically China, I guess,
and then Western Europe, maybe even Brazil, Mexico, et cetera.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, sure. I mean I think, overall,
despite some of the negativity in the news, we actually saw pretty good growth,
both from a revenue and orders perspective. By far, China had the best quarter
of the year. Think mid-single-digit in terms of revenue growth, strong
double-digit orders growth, bookings up double digits, so actually had a very,
very good quarter in China. Our long-cycle businesses performed extraordinarily
well, and it was a good quarter.

Despite what we read in Europe, Honeywell had a very strong
quarter in Europe as well. I mean up mid-single digits, strong growth across
the board. Probably, the only exception was Italy. We had a little bit of a
tougher. But overall, Europe was strong. Lat Am actually had a pretty good
quarter as well. They were up. Think about kind of a mid-single-digit growth.
And again, with some of the challenged economies there, it was a pleasant
surprise based how we're doing. Russia actually did well. Middle East did well.
A little bit of the soft spot was India, which was a bit unusual for us in Q3,
but we're still expecting in India double-digit growth for the year. So I'm not
particularly alarmed by the one data point. And then U.S., obviously continues
to be strong. So overall, both as I look at revenues and, more importantly,
orders, which is what positions us for 2020, it was actually a pretty strong
story and one that was very encouraging.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Good to hear. And just a completely
different follow-up would just be what does the customer adoption of Forge look
like in the context of is it kind of trialing and saying we'll give us a try
for a year? Is it more longer-term contracts? Is there something in the middle?
Is there some sort of standardized agreement that's starting to emerge as you
get deeper into this?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think, Scott, that, that varies
based on the franchise. I mean first, some of the connecteds are further ahead
than others. For example, in Q3, we had connected builds and the cybersecurity
leading in terms of strong double-digit growth. Some of them are a little
further behind. We have more mature offerings, I would say, in cyber, in the
aircraft segment, the building segment. Some of them are still in the
development stage. So some of them are -- that's typically how you start in an
engagement of a customer. You kind of do a proof of concept. The customer is
happy with that proof of concept, moves on to a broader assignment. So with --
are some that are in a broader rollout stage and some that are in a
proof-of-concept stage. As an example of our success, we've had a major player
in the Middle East do a proof-of-concept for us, which was highly successful,
and that same player is now rolling out our Forge solutions to the entire oil
and gas infrastructure, which will be worth millions of annual dollars per
year. So I think it just depends which one we're talking about, but I think,
overall, Forge was still in the early innings, and we're just launching the
various Forge offerings.

OPERATOR: Moving next, we'll go to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Can you just first walk through anything in the model for fourth
quarter with regards to the segments that you'd want to highlight? I mean SPS
is obviously one that I think would be helpful to get a little bit more kind of
pointed guidance around, whether it's organic growth or profits and any of the
other businesses that we may see variability outside of just kind of normal
seasonality and comps?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. So I think you're going to see
something pretty consistent with what we've just done in the third quarter. Obviously,
there's variability ranges around all of them. But as I described, I think Aero
is going to continue to lead the path from a growth perspective. And I think
we're going to see mid-single-digit kind of growth -- low to mid-single-digit
growth of growth in PMT and HBT. And I would expect to see SPS down single
digits again in the fourth quarter.

And the -- on the orders perspective, as we talked about in
the prepared comments, where we had a great Intelligrated quarter, 20%-plus
growth in orders, and we have been talking about those major systems projects
coming in, we expect more of that in the fourth quarter, and that ought to help
us get set for next year.

And then with the -- from a margin expansion perspective, I
think you're going to see the -- obviously, the removal of the spin comparison
is going to change the overall reported numbers, but I would expect to see
margin ranges that are going to look fairly similar from third into the fourth
quarter broadly speaking. But it's the same playbook. There's -- I don't expect
like a big divergence from one quarter to the next in any particular business.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Is 15% margin still a credible number
at SPS? And if you don't see progress there over the next kind of 12 months,
what kind of actions can you take?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. I think 15% is still a credible
margin rate to build back from as we enter into 2020. And again, if you look at
productivity products as an example, it's essentially kind of flattened out. So
we're showing organic declines, but the absolute value of the revenues has
really kind of flattened out over the last few quarters. And so -- and as we
talked about in the channel, that inventory level is going to come down to a
normalized level in 4Q. So as that begins to reaccelerate and as we continue to
get additional growth in the aftermarket size in Intelligrated, I absolutely
expect to see margins continue to bounce back and expand into 2020.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. And just maybe to add -- yes, just
add a couple of things to that. One is I think although maybe at a high level,
obviously, we would like to print better results on SPS. But in terms of
productivity products, we -- we're executing what we should be executing. The
inventory levels are dropping and are -- and we know exactly what they are, and
they drove double-digit campaigns in Q3. We see our sales out, they are
improving. We see better activity -- commercial activity on our Tier 1 wins. So
it's still not resulting in the financial results we'd hope to see, but the
progress from Q-over-Q is good. We've also enhanced some of the talent in that
business, and we've had some new people join. So I would say that for
productivity products, we're very much on track.

Intelligrated, which is maybe other part of the story, I
think as we discussed at the end of Q2, we got exactly the orders we expected
to get; 24% growth in Intelligrated year-over-year. They came in late. They
came in late in September, which are egregiously when they come that late and
it's still a projects kind of business, takes at least a couple of months to
convert orders -- at least to begin to convert orders into revenues. So
probably, we won't see more of that until we get to next 2020.

But the other expectation I want to highlight is we're expecting
another robust booking quarter in Intelligrated in Q4 this year. So I think
we're -- I'm not worried at all about what's going on in Intelligrated. I think
the market is being challenged through the first half of the year. When you
look at data points from CIMA and some of our industry competitors, I think
we're very much in line or even better than some of them. So I'm not -- I think

(technical difficulty)

we're executing as...

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: One last quick one for you just on
Aerospace is the -- can you just talk about what the combination of any kind of
potential headwinds from upgrades from this year combined with kind of the
Honeywell-specific growth initiatives, whether it's connected or anything like
that, is that a neutral to next year year-over-year? Is that a -- still a
positive, a slight negative? Can you just discuss the kind of dynamics between
those 2 moving parts?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I'm sure -- I think it's -- I think
the short story is kind of neutral. I think when we get into next year, it's
probably a little bit tougher comps given the double-digit growth rates, so I
think that that's realistic. You have some puts and minuses. I mean it's the
737 MAX, we anticipate it'll be back in service next year so that we'll get a little
bit more OE. Probably, some of the older aircraft will not be flying, so we'll
probably have a little bit more of the aftermarket stream. I think with
business aviation, we'll continue to be robust. We're very bullish on Defense
& Space. We're seeing good growth in space and the helicopter markets
again.

I think probably the toughest things on a year-over-year
basis will be the comps. The comps will be tougher. But I'm not sure there's
any kind of major onetimers that I think would prevail. In terms of the RMUs
and so on, we're continuing to invest. And our NPD engine on that, that's been
very successful for us. And obviously, Forge will grow. So that's -- those are
kind of the major puts and takes.

OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Jeff Sprague with
Vertical Research Partners.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, VERTICAL
RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: Just a couple things from me. First, could you just
elaborate a little bit on what's going on with the net below-the-line items?
What's driving the change from your prior outlook to the current outlook,
restructuring and other...

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Sure, yes. I mean it's primarily the
$0.03 favorability, again, roughly $30 million in the third quarter, a lot of
that has to do with foreign currency, and there's still a number of other
things below the line. So basically, the $50 million delta is $30 million of
our actual 3Q and a $20 million round about lower number in the fourth quarter.
Again, no -- there's no huge needle mover in there. And there's going to be a
range around that number, too. I mean we say about 1 55, but that will move
around a little bit as well.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: And is the margin itself moving around
like other income and pension and the like? What's the actual restructuring
outlook for Q4?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: We've got a sizable capacity. If you
remember, I think we booked something like $300 million of restructuring in
2018 in the fourth quarter. And we've got capacity loaded in there for
something similar. We're working our pipeline. And we're -- as we always do, we
continue to curate that restructuring pipeline, and we'll take advantage of the
projects that we have as we exit the year.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think maybe, Jeff, just something
else to add. We kind of give you a point number on below-the-line impact, and I
think that's approximate. I think we're probably going to revisit that for next
year because it really isn't a point number. There is some movement in it. It
can happen from quarter-to-quarter. And I think just to be that precise and
give you that precise number is probably a little bit inaccurate. I mean we try
to get as close as we can to our estimates, but we have some moving pieces in
there that Greg just described. So I think -- I don't think there was anything
major that moved. There's no major assumption changes or...

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Couple of things.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: But a couple of little things moved $20
million, $30 million, which, given the size of our company, isn't much. And
you'll get a different outcome. So I wouldn't read too much into it.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: Understood. And then just on the
projects, the late -- the long-cycle order dynamics sound quite encouraging.
Can you just elaborate a little bit on the cash flow impact of that? It does
sound like maybe the cash cycle on some of those are stretching out a little
bit. What kind of opportunity do you see perhaps to unlock some more cash from
working capital or other elements into the next year?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. I would say that's -- to use the
right word, it's the cash cycle. I wouldn't call it a problem. I mean we had
obviously very strong projects-related results as we were in last year and then
coming into the early part of this year, and that's cycled down a bit with the
orders pattern that we had seen previously. And now as that cycles back up,
you're going to restart the advanced cycle and unlock those large projects. And
so we expect to start seeing that coming back through.

And then we continue to do a lot of work around inventory as
well. The -- our inventory, while it hasn't been a huge year-over-year cash
flow comp problem for us, it's still growing. And we're trying to take that
down every year as we try to become more and more efficient. So we're still
working our initiatives around trying to drive inventory down as well. And we
hope and expect that that's going to be supportive as we continue to move into
the fourth quarter and into next year from a free cash perspective.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. As Greg pointed out, I think the
biggest mover for us here in the Q3 was sort of this movement around the
advances/unbilled in much of our projects business. That's really the biggest
needle mover. And we got a lot of our orders late. We weren't able to collect
the cash. And with -- from a last year perspective, a lot of those orders came
in earlier in the year, so we had the benefit of the advances. It's not the
case this year, and that was a big swing. That was maybe not as big of a
factor, but our reinvestment ratio was the highest in Q3 versus the whole year,
so that's probably the other factor, although not the major one for the cash
outcome.

OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with
RBC Capital Markets.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY, MD OF MULTI-INDUSTRY & ELECTRICAL
EQUIPMENT, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: On PMT and process, in
particular, it was impressive to hear about these projects in Russia and China.
We've heard from your competitors in process about pushouts of projects, in
particular. And are you seeing pushouts? Anything at the margin that you'd call
out?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: So we were actually very pleased with
our global major projects this quarter. I mean we were up strong double digit
actually in that segment, so that was one of the really nice stories for us for
the quarter, probably even better than we expected. So really nice progress,
and Q4 looks quite robust as well. So hopefully, we'll be able to secure those
as well. But I think that was one of the more positive stories for us in the
quarter and good orders growth in Russia, China, some of the economies that
have been -- that are presumably challenged. But frankly, we're not seeing
that.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: Got it. And this might be a bit of a
rhetorical question, but based upon the upside in Defense & Space this
quarter, the 17% growth in core revenues and commentary about 2020, are you
seeing Honeywell disadvantaged at all in some of the defense industry
consolidation that we're seeing?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No, I don't. I -- we -- we're not
generally a final system provider. We are component Tier 1 provider to those. I
don't think that calculus changes with the consolidation that's happening. We
continue to be a good supplier to a lot of those integrators and system
providers, but I don't see that dynamic changing.

OPERATOR: Moving next to Julian Mitchell with Barclays.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe just a first question around if you look at how demand
trended in recent months, you'd called out Intelligrated picking up late in Q3
and also some of the HBT activity in Europe. I wondered if there was anything
else that you would highlight that got better or worse over the past sort of 2
or 3 months as you moved through it. And also maybe how your own repositioning
and CapEx spending plans may have changed when you're thinking about 2020, if
at all.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean in terms of kind of some of
the changes, I think we had a relatively slow start in Europe for month 1 and
month 2 of the quarter. And they were a little bit concerned heading into
September. But September actually was very, very robust. And economies like
Germany, France, the U.K., all did very, very well. So we had -- although we
were worried, but September was very, very robust, much better than sort of
what the industrial GDP print would have you believe. So that was certainly
better.

Kind of as we think about 2020, it's probably -- as Greg
pointed, it's probably a tougher economic environment in 2020 than it is in
2019. But on the flipside of that, I don't see some fall off the cliff. I don't
-- as I look at our backlog, as I look at our growth rates in terms of the
long-cycle businesses, the level of bookings we have for Defense & Space,
the SPS pickup that we're expecting, reasonable comps for Aerospace, although
tougher, but maybe not double digit, but still could grow, we're certainly not
-- we're far from planning 2020 right now based on what we see as doom and
gloom kind of a year. That's for sure. And if anything, hopefully, there'll be
some more positive outcomes. Looks like Brexit may reach a positive conclusion
based on news we're hearing this morning. Hopefully, there'll be more of that
positive news to go here in Q4.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. And as it relates to
repositioning, I think we're -- as we go into 2020, we're going to have ample
capacity to continue driving our reposition portfolio and pipeline as we have
this year as well. So I expect that to continue to be a big part of our
productivity playbook for 2020 also.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL: And then just following up maybe on
SPS, specifically in that context. You're now in the third quarter of your
organic sales decline in that business. When we're thinking about the longevity
of this downturn, should we assume a classic sort of short-cycle duration of
maybe 5 quarters of sales decline there and then the recovery post that?

And allied to that, maybe just give us an update on how
comfortable you feel with the market share in productivity products in
particular.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, I think as we've stated in
the last quarter, I think productivity products is the business where we're
focused on some improved commercial activity. We saw some good signs of that in
Q3. And if you look at the margin profile -- incremental margin profile from Q2
to Q3, it was better. The team has adjusted their cost structure to the market
reality or their revenue base. But yes, I mean, I think we're trending in the
right direction, so we do expect productivity products to return to growth in
2020. That's very much our expectation. Based on what I'm seeing today, I don't
see anything which would prevent us from doing that, so I can't tell you
whether it's exactly 5 quarters or 3 or 4, but it -- we expect growth in 2020
is kind of the short story.

OPERATOR: We will take our next question from John Walsh
with CrÃ©dit Suisse.

JOHN FRED WALSH, DIRECTOR, CRÃ©DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Just, I guess, a question around price and maybe also a little bit
discussion around the price/cost equation. It looks like, at least for the Q,
price decelerated a touch in Q3, but obviously, the very strong margin
performance, I would assume you're pretty green on price/cost. But can you
maybe talk a little bit about that dynamic and how that's playing out into next
year as we're kind of still seeing some input deflation?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. I mean we've continued to have a
strong cadence around price across the company. So as we head into next year,
I'm not expecting that we're going to hit a wall and not be able to continue to
get price in the marketplace. And I said, the cost -- as markets are slowing
down, we're also doubling down on our procurement team in terms of driving our
material cost deflation program as well. So we're not going to keep pushing
hard on both of those levers and expect that to be a net positive for us as we
go into 2020.

JOHN FRED WALSH: Got you. And then maybe just on
highlighting the balance sheet capacity. I mean anything to call out there as
we look into next year, if there might be anything to do on the deal front?
Obviously, you announced some small things in the release today, but how should
we think about the use and the deployment of that next year?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. I mean I -- so first of all, we
continue to be very active with our M&A pipeline. And there's a lot of
things going on today as we speak, particularly given everything that's
happening in the marketplace. And we hope that, that will actually have a
benefit as we go forward in terms of asset prices possibly coming down and
making some things a bit more attractive.

As you saw with our stock purchase program, we continue to
do that pretty aggressively. And as we go into next year, I think we'll continue
to use that as a lever for us. It's been very successful here. And I think,
barring any large deals, I think we're going to continue to be targeting to
take out at least 1% of our share count on a year-on-year basis. So both of
those are going to be consistently deployed in terms of our expectations.

We did, as Darius mentioned, refinance some of our debt.
We've got some debt coming due in October, so we refinanced that in the third
quarter. So we still retain a very, very strong balance sheet with a lot of
access to capital. And with our strong cash flow and our repatriation program,
I think we've got a lot of ammunition for us to go ahead and use as we head
into next year.

OPERATOR: And that does conclude today's question-and-answer
session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Darius
Adamczyk for any additional or closing remarks.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: I want to thank our shareowners for
continued support of Honeywell. We have delivered strong results each quarter
this year and have continued to make great progress on our initiatives and
delivered on our commitments. We are well positioned in attractive end markets
with multiple levers for value creation and operational excellence in place.

We are focused on continuing to outperform for our
shareowners, our customers and our employees. Looking forward to sharing our
results as well as our 2020 outlook during our fourth quarter earnings call in
late January. Thank you for listening.

OPERATOR: Thank you, everyone. This does conclude today's
teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful
day.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
Honeywell's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's
conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.:
Thanks, April. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Second Quarter 2019
Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Darius
Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis.

This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP
reconciliations, are available on our website at 

.

Note that elements of this presentation contain
forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of
our businesses as we see them today.

Those elements can change, and we ask that you interpret
them in that light.

We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that may
affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.

For this call, references to adjusted earnings per share,
adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate
exclude the impacts from separation costs related to the 2 spin-offs of our
Homes and Transportation Systems businesses in 2018 as well as 2018 pension
mark-to-market adjustment and U.S. tax legislation, except where otherwise
noted. References to 2019 adjusted free cash flow guidance and associated
conversion exclude impact from separation costs related to the 2018 spin-offs.

This morning, we will review our financial results for the
second quarter of 2019, share our guidance for the third quarter and provide an
update to our full year 2019 outlook. And of course, we'll leave time for your
questions at the end.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chairman and
CEO, Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, CEO &
PRESIDENT, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning,
everyone. We're excited to be hosting our call this morning from Charlotte,
North Carolina, which will officially become our corporate headquarters on
August 1. It is an exciting time to be part of the Honeywell team as we
continue to transform our business into a premier technology company with
Charlotte as our home base.

Let's begin this morning on Slide 2. It was another very
strong quarter for Honeywell. We again delivered on our commitments, generating
earnings per share of $2.10, at the high end of our second quarter guidance, up
9%, excluding the impact of spin-offs in 2018. This strong earnings result was
driven by organic sales growth of 5% and 170 basis points of segment margin
expansion.

Notably, our segment profit, excluding the spins, on a
comparable basis for 2018 was up 9% this quarter and was the largest
contributor of EPS growth. For the first half of 2019, organic sales growth
reached 7%, which is a proof point to the investments we've made in our
business, in our sales force and new technologies that are winning in the
marketplace.

We continue to see the benefits from our strong positions on
key platforms in our long-cycle business aviation and the finance portfolios in
Aerospace; in our warehouse automation business, which is up over 20%
organically year-to-date and now generates approximately $2 billion in annual
sales; in our Building Technologies business, which had another great quarter.

Our Process Solutions and UOP businesses, which principally
serve the oil and gas industry, also both grew 5% organically this quarter, as
we continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making in the Honeywell
Connected Enterprise, which drove double-digit organic sales growth of our
software in the quarter.

In fact, this quarter, we signed a framework agreement to
deliver a Honeywell Forge asset performance management and improve the
reliability and performance of over 1,000 industrial assets for a large Middle
Eastern refinery.

Segment margin exceeded 21% in the second quarter, up 170
basis points, driven by smart portfolio enhancements we made in 2018, our
investments in the commercial organization and the benefits of previously
funded restructuring to improve our operations. Excluding the favorable margin
impact from the spin-offs, segment margin expanded 80 basis points, which was
30 basis points above the high end of our guidance.

Building on the progress we have seen for several quarters,
we delivered 100% free cash flow conversion, and we remain on path to
approximately 100% for the second year in a row. I am encouraged by our
progress in this area, and we remain focused on continuing to drive
improvements in working capital.

We also continue to [execute] our capital deployment
strategy, repurchasing $1.9 billion shares and closing 4 new Honeywell Ventures
investments in the quarter, bring our total to 12 new investments in the first
2 years of the fund.

As a result of our first half performance, we are raising
the low end of our full year organic sales guidance by 1point to a new range of
4% to 6% and raising the low end of our full year earnings per share guidance
to a new range of $7.95 to $8.15. We expect to generate approximately $6
billion in free cash flow for the year, so we have narrowed our free cash flow
guidance to reflect this.

While we are encouraged by our performance this quarter, we
are continuing to plan cautiously for the second half of the year, given the
uncertain macro environment in which we operate. We've seen some slowing in
certain short-cycle businesses that has been overcome by the strong performance
in the rest of the portfolio. We think it is prudent to plan conservatively in
the event of a broader slowdown, given that nearly 60% of our business is short
cycle in nature.

I'm very pleased by our performance in the first half. We
still have substantial work to do to achieve our plan, but I'm confident that
the team will continue to execute.

I'll stop there and turn the call over to Greg, who will
discuss our second quarter results and updated 2019 guidance in more detail.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS, SENIOR VP & CFO, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thanks, Darius, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to
begin on Slide 3.

As Darius highlighted, we delivered on our commitments again
in the second quarter, building on the strong start we had in Q1. Organic sales
growth and margin expansion performance across the majority of the portfolio
was very good.

A few highlights to mention. Defense & Space grew 20%
organically, and the Commercial Aftermarket and Aerospace grew 8% organically
with strong demand across both Air Transport and Business Aviation. Building
Technologies grew 5% organically after 9% in the first quarter, and Process
Solutions and UOP, which encompass our oil and gas portfolio, both grew 5%.

The impact of the spin-off of Garrett and Resideo, both
lower-margin businesses, contributed 90 basis points of segment margin
expansion. The remaining 80 basis points was the result of our strong
operational performance, primarily in Aerospace and Performance Materials and
Technologies. We continue to effectively manage the impacts of tariffs through
well-executed mitigation efforts and are in the final stages of eliminating all
spin-related stranded costs before year-end.

Notwithstanding our strong performance across most of the
portfolio, as we messaged in April and again in May, we did experience
challenges in Safety and Productivity Solutions and more specifically in the
Productivity products business, which drove a sales and segment margin decline
this quarter. I will address that in more detail in a minute.

Consistent with last quarter, the majority of our earnings
growth, $0.16, came through segment profit improvement. We realized a $0.06
benefit from our share repurchase program, which resulted in a weighted average
share count of 733 million shares this quarter.

Our effective tax rate was 21.5%, largely consistent with
the outlook we provided of 22%. Importantly, we were also able to fund a
substantial amount of fast payback repositioning in the quarter, more than $80
million, that will support our continued productivity focus, functional
transformation and supply chain initiatives that we discussed at our Investor
Day in May. These proactive measures will be helpful in the event of a slower
economy in the coming quarters.

Finally, adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $1.5
billion with conversion of 100%. The strong cash generation was most notable in
Aerospace and Building Technologies. We're very pleased with our results and
are focused on continuing the strong performance in the second half.

Let's turn to Slide 4 now to briefly discuss the second
quarter EPS bridge. Slide 4 walks our earnings per share from the second
quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019. As Darius mentioned, segment
profit growth was the main driver for the quarter. That acceleration was most
prominent in Aerospace and PMT due to a combination of higher organic sales
volumes, commercial excellence and our continued focus on productivity.

We also continue to utilize our balance sheet to lower our
share count. We deployed nearly $2 billion towards repurchases of Honeywell
shares, consistent with our plan to reduce the share count by at least 1%
during the course of this year.

Finally, we had a $0.05 headwind on an adjusted basis from
below-the-line expenses, primarily due to the proactive restructuring actions I
mentioned earlier and lower pension income year-over-year as a result of the
derisking actions we took in 2018. That was partially offset by benefits from
net interest expense and foreign exchange. Funding a strong pipeline of future
repositioning continues to be a key lever for our productivity playbook and
will serve us and our shareholders well as we go forward.

The punchline here is we had another high-quality quarter,
delivering EPS at the high end of our guidance range.

Now let's turn to Slide 5, and we can discuss our segment
performance. Starting with Aerospace. Sales were up 11% organically. This
marked the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth and capped
off an outstanding first half for 2019.

Defense & Space grew 20% organically, led by global
demand for guidance and navigation systems as well as increased spares volumes
on U.S. DoD programs, including the F-18 and F-22. The defense business is well
positioned. More than 50% of firm orders with delivery through 2020 are already
booked.

In Commercial OE, sales were up 4% organically, driven by
continued strength across the business jet platforms, which more than offset
declines stemming from the timing of air transport shipments. Notably, we saw
increased deliveries across all Gulfstream platforms and strong avionics
deliveries on certain Dassault platforms.

Regarding the Boeing 737 MAX situation, we remain aligned to
Boeing's stated production schedule, and we'll continue to monitor the
situation closely. But as we stated previously, we do not anticipate a
significant impact to Honeywell's operational results in 2019.

Aftermarket sales were up 8% organically, driven by demand
across both Air Transport and Business Aviation, and growth in retrofit,
modifications and upgrades, including related to the ADSP safety mandates. We
continue to see good adoption of our Connected Aircraft technologies, which
drove strong software sales growth in Aerospace, and continued to gain traction
for our JetWave solution across all Aerospace verticals, as demonstrated by the
C-17 win we announced in May, our first in the defense business.

Aerospace segment margin expanded 330 basis points, driven
by commercial excellence, higher sales volumes and margin accretion from the
spin of Transportation Systems. The spin contributed approximately 60 basis
points to Aero's total margin expansion. The Aero business continues to execute
well, investing in future technologies, driving productivity in Commercial
Excellence and has a healthy long-cycle backlog heading into the third quarter.

In Honeywell Building Technologies, sales were up 5%
organically driven by global demand for commercial fire products. As Vimal
Kapur and his team displayed at our investor conference in May, we are
innovating and launching new products in this business at a much faster rate
than we had in the past, and we continue to see good acceptance from our customers
and strong growth as a result.

We saw good growth across building management software
platforms, including [for Tridium], which, as you may remember, is our platform
for integrating building management systems and data using open and proprietary
communication protocols.

In Building Solutions, we drove growth in global projects
across the Americas and in the airport vertical in the Middle East. HBT's
segment margins expanded 390 basis points in the second quarter, driven by the
favorable impact from the spin-off of the Homes business.

The team continues to make steady progress on our goal to
eliminate the remaining stranded costs by year-end stemming from the Homes
spin. Segment margins, excluding the favorable impact from the spin accretion,
were roughly flat this quarter, a big improvement from the first quarter, and
we continue to make progress on supply chain optimization post the spin.
Overall, it was another great quarter for the HBT business with double-digit
projects backlog growth in Building Solutions, positioning the business well
for the second half of 2019.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were up 4%
on an organic basis. Process Solutions sales were up 5% organically, driven by
continued strength in our short-cycle businesses, primarily in software,
maintenance and migration services and field instrumentation devices.

We also saw growth in Smart Energy, primarily in North
America. The short-cycle backlog of (inaudible) Process Solutions is up over
12%, giving us confidence that the growth in the automation portfolio should
continue into the second half.

UOP sales were up 5% organically, driven by growth in
licensing and engineering as well as refining catalysts. We saw particular
strength in North America with reinvestment in existing refining infrastructure
and select new investments in petrochemicals and strong backlog conversion in
the Middle East.

UOP orders and backlog were both up over 10% for the
quarter. Additionally, on a year-to-date basis, UOP orders in China were up
double digits, primarily driven by growth in equipment, licensing and
catalysts.

Organic sales growth in Advanced Materials of 2% was driven
by a demand for our Solstice line of low global-warming refrigerants and
blowing agents. However, this was partially offset by lower pricing due to the
impact of illegal HFC imports in Europe.

Enforcement and monitoring of the EU F-Gas Regulation has
been an emerging challenge, and we're working diligently in partnership with
other producers, EU regulators and EU member countries to address the harmful
illegal imports.

Overall, PMT segment margins expanded by 140 basis points in
the second quarter, driven by Commercial Excellence across all lines of
business, direct material productivity and further improvements in our supply
chain.

Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were
down 4% on an organic basis in the quarter, and segment margins contracted 420
basis points. The weakness we saw this quarter was principally in our
short-cycle, high-margin productivity products business.

Similar to the first quarter, we saw a combination of
continued distributor inventory destocking, fewer large project rollouts in the
mobility space and lower channel sell-through. The second quarter sales mix in
SPS negatively impacted our margins as the volume declines we experienced were
in more profitable parts of the business.

We continue to see growth in our sensing and IoT business
and robust demand for voice solutions and aftermarket maintenance and services
and warehouse automation. As Darius mentioned during last quarter's earnings
release, Intelligrated is beginning to face tougher and tougher comps as we get
deeper into the year following 5 quarters of approximately 20%-plus growth. We
are seeing timing of new major system rollouts push into the second half of the
year.

This effect, coupled with tougher sales comps in the second
quarter, drove flattish sales in Intelligrated in 2Q. The large project order
pushouts we saw in Q2 are consistent with our customers' latest planning and
not an indication of project losses.

Intelligrated's aftermarket business, which enhances
customer outcomes through consultative engagements to improve productivity, was
up strong double digits organically, driven by demand for comprehensive life cycle
support and service. The business is benefiting from the large installed base
growth in the core Intelligrated portfolio. The outlook for this business
overall remains very strong, and we delivered organic sales growth of over 20%
for the first half of 2019, and we continue to expect this to be a growth
business long term.

Within the safety business, organic sales growth was 1%. We
saw continued demand for gas detection products, which grew low single digits
organically, and retail footwear, which was up high digits -- high single
digits organically. That was largely offset by decreased volumes of general
safety and personal protective equipment.

In our key end markets for the safety business, we see solid
demand for Portable Gas Detection in the U.S. but slower activity in the
industrial sector given distributor inventory levels.

Let's now turn to Slide 6 and discuss our third quarter
outlook. Our planning assumptions are largely consistent with the second
quarter dynamics with some further caution on short cycle. We expect our growth
this quarter will be driven by a combination of continued long-cycle strength
in Aerospace and Defense, coupled with short-cycle demand in Building
Technologies and healthy backlog in UOP and Process Solutions. The Aerospace
business, as I mentioned, has grown 10% or more organically the past 4
quarters, and we expect continued strong performance due to the order growth
rates and backlog in Defense.

We've established a significant backlog of new major system
awards for Intelligrated over the past year that will drive growth into 2020
and allow for an expansion of our shorter-cycle aftermarket and service
businesses. We are taking a cautious view on the short-cycle growth as many of
the macro signals, the China GDP, U.S.-China trade tensions and Brexit, just to
name a few, are still clouding the economic outlook. We think it's prudent to
plan conservatively given the uncertainties, and our 3Q and second half
guidance reflect that.

As it relates to the sale of weapons to Taiwan by the U.S.
government and potential sanctions from China, we see no reason why Honeywell
would be potentially sanctioned by the Chinese government, and we have received
no official word from the Chinese government that Honeywell is on a sanctioned
list of entities.

Now let's discuss our segment outlook. In Aerospace, we
continue to see robust demand in both business aviation and in U.S. and
international defense, supported by robust orders growth and firm backlogs for
orders with delivery into 2020.

Air Transport shipments should increase sequentially, driven
by demand for A350 and A320 aircraft and lower customer incentives. We will see
tougher comparisons in business aviation given the significant organic sales
growth in the third quarter of 2018. Consistent with last quarter, we expect
the Commercial Aftermarket activity will be driven by flight hours, airline
demand and further tailwinds from the adoption of safety and compliance
mandates, principally in business aviation.

In Building Technologies, we expect good growth with
strength primarily in commercial fire products in Americas and EMEA and growth
in building management software in High Growth Regions and for Tridium .

On the service side, we expect to see Building Solutions
growth continue, given the large order funnel and considerable backlog growth
in projects and services. As a reminder, HBT does have significant short-cycle
exposure, particularly in the products vertical. And although we haven't seen
order rates slow, we are planning cautiously here in the second half.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, we expect to see
short-cycle demand for products and services and Process Solutions and growth
in equipment, absorbents and refining catalysts in UOP. We saw good bookings in
equipment and catalysts in the second quarter and growth in the Process
Solutions service bank for new contracts and renewals, which we believe sets
PMT up for another good quarter in the third quarter.

Finally, given the challenges we experienced in productivity
products and our assumption that the inventory destocking continues for the
balance of 2019, we are expecting to see continued headwinds in SPS from both a
sales and segment margin perspective, but anticipate that will moderate in the
fourth quarter.

We expect Intelligrated's third quarter performance to be
similar to 2Q with 20-plus percent growth in the aftermarket business, but
slower large project growth. We maintain a robust backlog of project awards
from blue-chip customers and see a very strong pipeline of potential awards in
the third and the fourth quarters.

The net below-the-line impact, which is the difference
between segment profit and income before tax, will be minimal this quarter. The
difference year-on-year is driven primarily by lower pension income, the
benefit from spins' indemnification payments, partially offset by higher
repositioning funding.

Now let's move to Slide 7 to discuss our revised full year
guidance. As Darius noted, we are raising the low end of our full year organic
sales, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance. Our organic sales
guidance moves 1 point on the low end to a new range of 4% to 6% while our
segment margin guidance is unchanged.

A revised earnings per share guidance of $7.95 to $8.15
represents earnings growth of 8% to 10% adjusted, excluding the impact from the
spins in 2018. We remain on track to deliver approximately 100% free cash flow
conversion.

Our position on tariffs is unchanged. We expect no
significant impact in 2019 given the proactive measures we have taken to
mitigate. We also continue to closely monitor the Brexit situation and are
communicating regularly with our customers, partners and suppliers. As we
stated last quarter, we're planning for various potential Brexit outcomes,
including a no-deal Brexit scenario, to ensure that as the terms of the U.K.'s
departure from the EU are finalized, we are well positioned to continue meeting
our customers' needs.

Our guidance continues to reflect a weighted average share
count of 731 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. Our
net below-the-line expenses are now expected to be approximately $120 million
in 2019. This reflects slightly higher reposition expense charges, partially
offset by greater interest income.

We continue to be confident in our ability to execute and in
our outlook. We're sticking to the playbook around short-cycle caution, given
the macro uncertainties that remain in the second half of the year.

With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius,
who will wrap it up on Slide 8.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Thanks, Greg. We are encouraged by the
performance from our businesses thus far in 2019. We continue to execute on our
commitments to share owners by generating strong organic growth in many end
markets and have multiple levers to enable further margin expansion. Our
operational performance is generating strong free cash flows and conversion
while investing in the business to ensure we are well positioned for the
future.

I'm also encouraged by our progress with the business
transformation initiatives we've discussed at our Investor Day, particularly
given the -- because of the significant opportunity I see in these areas and
the future of Honeywell.

Let's be clear. We have a lot of work to do to execute these
initiatives, but I continue to be excited by the energy enthusiasm I see across
the employee population to move the ball forward and truly differentiate
Honeywell from our competitors.

With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.

MARK MACALUSO: Thanks, Darius. Darius and Greg are now
available to answer your questions. April, if you could, please open the line
for Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is
coming from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE, VP & LEAD MULTI-INDUSTRY ANALYST,
GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So look, nice quarter. I guess,
the -- obviously, there's going to be a lot of questions around the short-cycle
commentary. I heard you guys say cautious a few times during the prepared comments.
I guess maybe as I think about your business today and the Safety and
Productivity Solutions side, maybe talk a little bit more why you expect the
destock to last, and what's really driving that through the fourth quarter? And
then secondarily, in that business, the commentary around new major system
rollouts being pushed out, I'm just curious whether you guys are seeing any
saturation in that market.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, let's maybe take that kind of 2
segments. So number one is we anticipated some level of destocking to occur. I
mean, obviously, the distributor levels weren't supported by the level of
business. So what we've projected for Q3 and Q4 is some level of moderation,
but certainly a continuation of the trend in terms of softness in that end
market as the destocking continues. Well, obviously, our plans are a bit better
than that, but what I don't want to do is, in the short-cycle business, I don't
want to be forecasting too aggressively and then end up disappointing. So
that's kind of what we have baked in, particularly into the Q3 outlook, which
is still negative and moderating a bit more into the Q4. Because one of the
things we're trying to really assess -- and how much of this is market and how
much of this is us. I mean, that's still unclear. Some of the early indications
we had that the market is getting softer. But again, until we see all the data
points and several competitors' reports and put all that -- piece all that
together, we're really not sure. For now, we're going to assume it's us because
I think I don't want to just say, "Well, it's the market. So we don't need
to do anything." We -- I can tell you we have a very aggressive commercial
program to address some of these challenges and to drive business at the
end-user level.

The good news here on productivity products is this is not a
technology issue. We actually have very good technologies. They've been
successfully launched most recently in Q2 around our warehouse business and our
[TLC], which is our strongest segment. So I'm very encouraged by that. So
that's really the story on SPS, I should say, on productivity products.

In terms of Intelligrated, it's a very different story.
Intelligrated has been growing by strong double digits like think well north of
20% on average for the last several quarters. And what's happening there is
simply some of the orders that we expected in Q2 got pushed out a little bit.
They're still out there. We expect to book them in Q3, Q4. We didn't lose them.
I know that for a fact, and the business is going to continue to grow. And
we're very bullish on the business, so there isn't a greater or different story
here. The business is gaining share. It's performing extraordinarily well. We
see a little bit of a blip in delay in terms of the order bookings, and that's
what we accounted for in our outlook.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes, and I would also just add that the
aftermarket business, which, as you know, capturing the installed base and then
going and mining the aftermarket, is a big part of that whole thesis, is doing
terrific. We're up over 20% on the [LSS] business and have been for multi
quarters. And as you know, that also carries a higher-margin profile. So I
think that part of the playbook is working nicely.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE: That's helpful to hear. And
obviously, we prefer for you guys to be prudent as your planning assumptions go
for the second half of the year, I guess. I guess, on -- in that vein, right,
like you started the year off with roughly 7% organic growth above where your organic
guide is for the year, long-cycle backlog still plus 10%, I guess what is then
the embedded planning assumption for the short-cycle businesses? It seems like
you're planning for very, very low growth, if any growth, in short cycle in the
second half of the year, and maybe what are some of the puts and takes you've
got there?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Well, again, Joe, the productivity
products one is a big contributor to that, but you're right. For the remainder
of the short-cycle businesses, I would say outside of maybe the Aerospace
aftermarket, we're planning for low single digits. And again, as we've seen
that can turn very quickly, so we don't want to get too far out ahead of our
skis there.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think you have it right,
Joe. I mean, it's, I think, LST for short-cycle, think MST to maybe even a
touch higher for the longer cycle, depending upon those segments, but that's
sort of the rough math. So the punchline is we are planning somewhat cautiously
for the second half because the geopolitical and the economic movements are
pretty volatile right now, and what we try to do is we try to guide that
somewhat cautiously based on what we're seeing today, and the short cycle is
somewhat unpredictable and can turn very quickly.

OPERATOR: And our next question is coming from John Inch
with Gordon Haskett.

JOHN GEORGE INCH, MD & SENIOR ANALYST OF
MULTI-INDUSTRIALS, GORDON HASKETT RESEARCH ADVISORS: I think, Greg, you had
mentioned that you are taking proactive steps for Brexit. What exactly -- in
case there's a hard Brexit, what exactly does that mean? Does it mean you're
sort of...

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. It's really about certifications,
John. Yes, it's really about certifications and making sure that certified
bodies in the EU are going to allow the product flow to continue. So we've been
basically recertifying our products with other EU bodies as opposed to the U.K.
bodies that we had many of our certifications through. And that's been an
ongoing effort. And we're substantially complete at this stage, which is very
good, and then we're just also setting up additional triage in terms of actual
movement of goods in the event we need to do anything special or different in
terms of airfreight or premium freight in that sense to get product to flow. So
those are really the 2 things that the teams have been working most closely on.
And you could imagine, too, when you think about that even from our own
internal wiring, there's systems changes and so on that need to allow those
things to be true for us internally as well. So that's what the teams have been
furiously preparing for, so that we're ready no matter which way this goes.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: And then how did Europe and China do as
regions? I remember China was down a little bit last quarter, obviously, given
sort of some of the shorter-cycle stuff going on there. I think Europe was more
resilient. Was -- any sort of real change and change in terms of China and the
kind of regional impact like the Malaysia sort of Middle East impact? Is there
anything else that you would call out there?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I'll take that one, John. I mean, I
think overall, we were kind of pleased. I mean, I'll highlight a couple of
things. For example, our PMT bookings in China were around 20% in Q2. So I
mean, some real strengths. We had some tough comps, think flattish to slightly
up for China for Q2, but that's driven by particularly some of the tough comps
that we had in PMT. So I -- overall, I mean, I -- obviously, there's some level
of concern for the China economy, but, overall, given the bookings we saw in
PMT, that was strong. Europe stayed strong, think low to mid-single-digit for
us, sort of some spotty in places. Germany was strong, Italy not so much, but
overall fairly good growth rate for us. Middle East was very, very strong.
We're very encouraged by that. India was up double digit, very strong growth
there, LatAm doing well. So for the most part, we're still seeing pretty good
growth around -- across the globe granted China maybe wasn't what it was last
year but also not a complete meltdown and move downward. So overall, we're
still encouraged by what we're seeing out there.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: Darius, do you feel that the backlog of
restructuring projects that you have would be more than sufficient if sort of
the cadence of the global economy continues to soften a little bit? Or would
you actually be looking to do more projects? Obviously, you guys are pretty
aggressive in terms of your playbooks historically. I'm just...

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, I think -- John, I think
that's the highlight -- that's maybe one of the highlights of the quarter. I
think we really invested in our future this quarter. We had some very, very
attractive restructuring projects, and we wanted to make sure we fund them
because we probably could have delivered even higher EPS result in Q2 if we
didn't fund those. But we thought it was prudent, particularly in this level of
economic uncertainty to fund those restructuring projects now, particularly
given the kind of paybacks we saw in those.

But the real answer to your question is, I guess, it all
depends upon how much of an economic hit we would take. We're kind of protected
to the levels we're forecasting. If those economic cycles are deeper than that,
then obviously we'd have to do more. So it's a bit of a wild ride as you can
see right now with sort of new news items coming every day. But we do what we
do all the time, which is we plan cautiously (technical difficulty) work
productivity. And if the environment is worse than we anticipate, then we're
going to take another round of cost actions to offset those.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. And I mean, just so you know, the
repositioning pipeline is a process just like a sales pipeline or an R&D
pipeline. We're working that at all times, so that we are ready when the
opportunities present themselves from a funding perspective and obviously as
the economic environment moves. So that's absolutely part of our routine all
times.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC
Capital Markets.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe we can follow up on some of Joe's beginning questions
on the push-outs that you're seeing. And so for Intelligrated, the push-outs,
are they attributed to anything in particular? Is it macro uncertainty? Do you
just have any sense of what's driving the delay in capital commitment? And then
similarly, one of your competitors in process has been talking about seeing big
project push-outs out of the second quarter into the third and fourth quarter.
I'd be interested if you're seeing some of those dynamics as well.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I'm sure -- let's start with
Intelligrated. I'm not sure there's a single cause for that. Some of these
projects are fairly substantial from a capital perspective. And there's timing
around Board meetings and so on, but we have an indication from our customers
that these projects will happen. So I don't anticipate that will result in
cancellations. The timing is always unpredictable on large projects. We expect
some of those to land in Q3. It wouldn't shock me if they land in Q4, but
they're not disappearing, and they're not being canceled.

In terms of the large projects, I mean, PMT had pretty good
booking quarters overall. It was stronger in UOP than it was in HPS. We're
seeing something somewhat similar on the large projects per se. Those are
getting -- sliding to the right a little bit. But we saw some other strong
bookings, particularly on the shorter cycle, some of our services build
business, our advanced solutions, our software businesses. So it's been a bit
of a mixed story when it comes to larger projects. Maybe perhaps those are
sliding a little bit to the right, but our backlog grew. Our bookings were good
in PMT, and we anticipate pretty strong second half of the year.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: And then across the shorter-cycle
portfolio and the softness that you're seeing, are you seeing any competitors
beginning to use price as a weapon here to drive some volume? And take us
through the portfolio on where pricing may have seen some of that pressure.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, I think all short cycle isn't the
same. I mean, as we look at HBT, I think our short cycles actually stayed
fairly strong. I mean, I think the results speak for themselves. It's been a
really good first half for our HBT business, and we actually are expecting that
to continue into Q3. The business is doing very, very well.

On SPS, it's the productivity products issue that we talked
about earlier. I can't really necessarily point to price. I mean, as the market
is softer, pricing becomes more of a challenge. Some of that is definitely
true, but I don't want to point at competition that this is necessarily any
kind of a pricing thing. I mean, yes, there's greater level of competition when
markets get softer, that's true.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: We've had -- I mean, we're getting
price, and we're getting growth still in the short cycle currently, again, with
the exception of the productivity products story.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: And then as we mentioned in the
prepared remarks in the HFC business, that's one place where we're seeing a
very specific competitive move going on with some of the illegal imports coming
in into Europe. So that's really the only place that I would highlight as
something really visible that we can see competitively.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. yes.

OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from Scott Davis
with Melius Research.

SCOTT REED DAVIS, FOUNDING PARTNER, CHAIRMAN, CEO &
RESEARCH ANALYST OF MULTI-INDUSTRY RESEARCH, MELIUS RESEARCH LLC: You guys are
putting up pretty predictable numbers each quarter. And it just begs the
question, you spent a good chunk of the Investor Day talking about Forge and connectivity
and all these interesting things you're working on and also the supply chain
stuff. Is there any way to measure kind of your progress in these areas? Like,
for example, the big margin gains you had this quarter, could you ascribe any
of that to supply chain? Or is that still kind of out there on the come?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, yes. I think let me start taking
this. I think in terms of a lot of our ISC transformation, I can't -- we are in
the -- we're not even in the top of the first. We're -- I mean, we're just kind
of -- we're grabbing the bat at this juncture. So that's something that you're
going to see a lot more pronounced really in 2020 and beyond. We're just
getting started. So I'm not going to tell you there's a lot attributed to the ISC
transformation. You probably shouldn't expect much until 2020 and beyond. In
terms of Forge and our software play, I think really the best way to measure
that business is growth. That's sort of the single biggest metric I use. And is
it profitable growth? And I was very pleased with what we're seeing, double
digits software growth, margin that's accretive to Honeywell, margin that's
very attractive, and we're gaining traction. We're winning jobs. We pointed to
the large Middle East win that we had, which is very large in scope. And our
customers trust us, so I'm very pleased with the strategic progress we're
making. But our measures are typically financial in nature because you can make
yourself feel good by looking at actions, we look at financials. And especially
for Forge and Connected Enterprise, ultimately, we look at the growth rates.
And they've been double digit, which is good, which is around expected.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. And the other thing, I guess, I
would highlight is, internally, we're looking, obviously, at recurring revenue
streams and trying to continue to enhance our recurring revenue streams. So
that's something that as we measure the progress in the Connected, that will be
one that we watch as well pretty closely.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Okay, makes sense. And I just have kind of
a question about Intelligrated in the sales cycle. I mean, when you install --
when you do the big project, presumably, there's some sort of warranty period.
I mean, when do you start getting aftermarket from those installs?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: It's after the completion and turning
over the project over to the user. Because a lot of times, we'll get the
service contract as soon as the job's completed. I mean, yes, and granted
there's some things that are on warranty, but we're trying to have the same
approach with the Intelligrated business as we do with our HPS business, where
we have these longer cycle, the assurance 360 type of contracts. And we've had
great traction in that, over 20% growth in Q2. And this -- by the way, this I'm
not indicating any kind of a slowdown in this business. I don't think we can
expect the 20-plus percent growth rates that we've seen, but we think that this
is going to be a high single digit to double digit growth kind of business. But
what we've seen that although the push-outs of the orders, although
disappointing, the good news in the -- and the fact that our strategy is
working is this, which is our services business was up over 20%, enabled that,
that business to have an accretive margin to what it had last year. And the
strategy we're trying to execute is working. Unfortunately, we can't control
the timing of when these orders land, but I can tell you that they're not due
to losses.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Yes. I mean, just a quick follow-up on
that. I mean, at what point does aftermarket become a bigger piece than the
install revenues? Is it 2 years out, 5 years out?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: To be honest, Scott, I hope not for a
while, right? Because that means that our project cycle is slowing. But it's a
bit of a function. Still the projects business is the predominant component in
that business. So what would have to occur is the services business, they're
already growing at over 20%. The projects business slowed a little bit this
past quarter. I actually hope that we get more of the project, and I think that
will happen. I don't think that this is now the sign of the warehouse
automation segment is slowing. I think that this could be a blip for a quarter
or 2. And it will resume, but that's really kind of how things will work is
ultimately the projects business will slow down. I don't think that's
necessarily now. And the [LSS] is going to become a bigger growth component of
the business. We kind of saw a little bit of a preview of that in Q2, but I
don't think that's a long-term trend yet.

OPERATOR: Our next question is coming from Steve Tusa with
JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Just so we're all on the same page here on the SPS thing. How should we
think about kind of absolute profits for the third quarter? And then I know you
guided to something like $1.1 billion or something like that for the year. Are
we kind of just south of $1 billion for the year now when it comes to
profitability? And then just as a follow-up, pretty big miss. You guys were out
that EPG, not too late, but late May. Did something change significantly in
June? Or was this something that you knew about, but there was enough offset in
the rest of the portfolio that you didn't feel the need to call it out?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, I think, Steve, let me kind
of maybe start the second comment, and then I'll turn it over to Greg. In terms
of SPS and more specifically productivity products, I think we called that out
both in our Q1 earnings report, and John talked about it at our Investor Day. I
think that we were pretty clear that this is going to be another quarter where
we're going to see destocking and some challenges on sort of commercial. So I
think that -- was this a little bit greater than we anticipated? Yes. Was --
did we signal it? I think we did. And we maybe specifically didn't talked about
it at EPG, but we certainly did at our Q1 earnings call, and John talked about
it specifically at Investor Day. So I'm not sure that we're shocked by what we
saw. It's like I said, a little bit more pronounced than we anticipated, but
not totally out of whack with our expectations.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. Then on the profitability front,
Steve, I think given the mix of sales that we're seeing in the second quarter,
I think it's going to look fairly similar in Q3. So I would expect margin rates
to be in that same range of 11%, 12% type margins in the third quarter. Fourth
quarter should get a little bit better, but that's how we're thinking about it
as we exit the second half.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. So like $225 million to $250
million in the fourth quarter, something to that extent on segment profit?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. The margin rates are going to be
in that, again, similar range.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. One last quick one. Just when
you guys talk about short cycle, I mean, to me, when I kind of look at the
results, commercial aftermarket and some of the shorter-cycle stuff in PMT, --
Building Technologies is perfectly fine. I mean, you're really -- you're not
necessarily talking about like all short cycle. It seems like it's a kind of an
SPS type of dynamic. And how bad was the kind of scanning and mobility side,
the stuff that you compete with Zebra on? I mean, how negative kind of was that
in the quarter?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, I mean -- yes, I think that's
right, Steve, this story is really about productivity products. That was the --
yes, we -- that was what we signaled. It was a little bit worse than we thought.
It wasn't a good outcome, and it was down for the quarter . So it was a little
bit down that -- more down than we thought. Some of that is my guess, although
I want to emphasize I don't know yet because I always assume it's our issue,
not a market issue. I think there was obviously some issues in the market and
the market slowing. We've had some early data points which would indicate that
and some commercial execution things that we need to fix as well as really the
destocking thing was the biggest factor is, frankly, the inventory levels
really exiting 2018 are unsupported by the business levels. And some of our
distributors are taking actions to do that. So that's really -- it's really
kind of the negative story. It's not -- you're right. It's not widespread. It's
predominantly limited to one business, which didn't have a great Q2.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Yes. And that's why you guys planned
conservatively for the second half?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: That's right, yes.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes.

OPERATOR: Our next question is coming from Gautam Khanna
with Cowen and Company.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY,
LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: (technical difficulty) $1.9 billion of stock in the Q,
I think that's a multiyear record or close to it. Are you still thinking $4
billion repo in the year? And then also another -- a second question is if you
could please just like speak about the M&A pipeline and whether or not
you're seeing anything attractive.

MARK MACALUSO: I'm sorry. This is Mark. Can you restate the
question? We missed the first part of it.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: You got cut off in the beginning.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA: I'm sorry about that. So my question was
related to the stock repurchase. You bought $1.9 billion in the quarter. Are
you still thinking around $4 billion for the year? And the second question was
if you could just kind of give some color about the M&A pipeline and
whether you're seeing anything attractive.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Sure. So you're right. $1.9 billion was
a fairly healthy amount of repo in the quarter. I think we're about $2.6
billion on a year-to-date basis, and all of that is still aiming at getting the
1% reduction from year-to-year. So $4 billion for the year is probably in the
right neighborhood of where we'll land. Obviously, some of that depends on the
share price performance for the remainder of the year, but I think that's a
reasonable assessment of what the end of the year will look like. And then as
it relates to the M&A pipeline, I mean, we continue to be active. I
wouldn't say we had other quarters we've come in and talked about having things
that were right at the 1-yard line that didn't happen. I don't think we had
anything that was quite that close in this particular quarter, but we continue
to be very active across all 4 of the businesses. And then as we've talked
about, we're ramping up the activity, particularly in HBT, given the fact that
that business is now in a much, much firmer footing.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA: Okay. And if I can squeeze one more in
here. What are your -- what are the demand [transact] expectations for PMT in
the second half? Kind of what sort of growth are you looking at for those, for
UOP, HBS and Advanced Materials?

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: I think about that as mid-single
digits. Again, with the backlogs that we have entering the back half of the
year, we think mid-single digits is a very reasonable spot for PMT.

OPERATOR: And our next question is coming from Jeffrey
Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, VERTICAL
RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: So we spent a lot of time on SPS for good reason, but
let's talk Aero for a moment. The margins were extraordinarily strong there,
stronger than I might have guessed given the mix. I know you've got some commercial-like
margins in part of your Defense & Space business, but can you give us a
little bit more color on what really played out in the margins in the quarter,
and how you see the rest of the year playing out there?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think that's -- that
margin growth is really a testament to the execution prowess of the Aerospace
team. And a lot of our strategies are working. I think sometimes we forget that
our software business isn't just in Honeywell Connected Enterprise, it's also
in our avionics franchise. And that group has done a tremendous job in really
shifting its focus through RMUs and upgrades, enhancements. And we saw the
benefits in that because it obviously has accretive margin rates. They've done
a great job of driving productivity in the business. So although this is that
ultimate combination, we also want to see which is you drive productivity while
getting good growth. And you really expand the margins. Obviously, focus on the
Connected Enterprise and Connected Aircraft is helping margins as well, good
growth on spares. The BGA market is very, very strong right now, both in terms
of OE and aftermarket. It's a testament to a lot of the great wins we've had on
the platforms, but also in supporting our customers on flight. So overall, and
then lastly, but surely importantly, Defense & Space has just been on fire.
And just about any segment you want to look we've been there. Whether it's
helos, whether it's the U.S. international defense, all those segments are
doing well. And I think this is really an important fact, Jeff, that as we look
from now through the end of 2020, end of 2020, we have more than 50% of the
business already booked. So we're really in a really nice shape as we look into
the future.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: Right. Just back to this China
question, I fully understand your position and statement this week as it
relates to this. I wonder if you have seen or how you would kind of keep an eye
out for maybe more subtle pressures, not only on you, but, obviously, your --
you would see it in your own business. But any indication that U.S. or Western
companies are just kind of getting a little bit of the cold shoulder around the
edges or any other kind of behavioral change in the business that you picked
up?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: I mean, no, I don't. And I think as Greg
pointed out in his -- I mean, I don't -- and I know we received some
interesting press on this subject, but we have seen no indication from the
China authorities that there are any sanctions coming our way. We have received
no sanction. I think I'll point to a couple of things. Number one is we
received our first JetWave order in China, and which is very promising. I
mentioned that PMT bookings in China were very, very strong in Q2. China is an
important market for us. We play it locally. We have a lot of manufacturing, a
lot of R&D facilities in China. It's a market that we take great pride in
serving local for local, and we expect that to continue.

OPERATOR: Our next question is coming from Julian Mitchell
with Barclays.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe just a first question around overall cadence of demand
in recent months. Your organic sales growth was 8% in Q1. It's guided at the
midpoint of 3% in Q3. So a pretty severe slowdown with comps that are not that
different. Aside from what you've talked about in SPS, have you seen any
changes in demand in recent months? Several companies talked about June being
materially worse than the rest of Q2. Just wondered what you've seen recently
in that respect.

GREGORY PETER LEWIS: Yes. Julian, this is Greg. We haven't
seen any really clear pattern like that across the portfolio that would cause
us to say that June is the beginning of a huge slowdown. So just across the
portfolio, I would say the answer is no. But as Darius mentioned earlier, the
portfolio is not one thing. And so I expect and -- that we're going to see
different dynamics across the different parts of the portfolio and across
different parts of the globe. Darius talked about the strength in Europe
earlier, and there's a lot of strength there because the Aerospace business is
doing particularly well. And as long as flight hours stay strong, we expect to
see Europe continuing to do well there. The dynamics in China, as we mentioned,
are strong on the long-cycle side with the UOP orders. So we've got very strong
backlog in PMT and their short-cycle businesses. So, so far, the answer, no
real pattern down, but it's something we absolutely watch, as you would expect.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. And just to maybe to add to that,
actually, if you look at June, it's -- on a year-over-year organic growth
basis, it was our best month. Now granted you saw some softness in SPS, which
was pronounced, and that's why we have a bit more of a cautious guide for Q3.
That's really the reason, is we're not expecting a miraculous turnaround in SPS
in Q3. We -- with some of the softness we saw in June, we actually anticipate
may continue, and that's why you see our guide. But overall, if you look at
total Honeywell organic, June, on a year-over-year basis, was actually our best
month of the quarter.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL: Great. And maybe just picking up on
your last point, Darius. Within SPS, the warehouse and Workflow Solutions piece,
revenue growth there was 7% in Q2 after sort of 50% growth in Q1. What should
we expect in the second half in terms of warehouse and Workflow Solutions sales
trends specifically? Do you expect to pick up from Q2 as some of those orders
get realized or you're leaving it as a sort of single-digit growth assumption
for now?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, if you're referring to
productivity products, which I think there's kind of 2 different components, we
don't expect a major turnaround here in Q3. Like we said, we still expect that
to be negative for Q3 and some level of moderation in Q4. As it -- when it
comes to Intelligrated, we're still expecting high single digit, double digit
growth for the year. Q3 is a little bit dependent upon exactly when we land
some of the orders, but think about we're now getting into the tougher and
tougher comps, so we're thinking about single digit kind of growth rate for the
second half. But again, just to be clear, that's depending upon when those
orders come because we're ready to execute those, and we have every indication
that they'll land. Obviously, getting those sooner in Q3 would be better.
Getting them later or pushed out [to Q4] would be worse. And that's a little
bit tough to predict, but I'm very bullish on our ability to secure those
orders when they do land. That I'm not that concerned about.

OPERATOR: The final question is from Josh Pokrzywinski from
Morgan Stanley.

JOSHUA CHARLES POKRZYWINSKI, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a couple of, I guess, more cleanups than anything else.
I think we've beaten SPS to death, so hopefully John can take the rest of the
day off. On Aerospace specifically, clearly commercial aero aftermarket doing
very well, I want to make sure that there's nothing unsustainable there,
particularly as it pertains to the MAX grounding maybe with some of these other
older aircraft filling the schedule that aftermarket gets a little bit of
boost, and we shouldn't expect all of that to continue. I know the trend line
is good. I just didn't know if there was a little extra that you got out of the
quarter.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I would say this. There's probably
a little bit of that of where you had more sort of older aircraft flying
vis-ÃÂ -vis, so -- but that's not going to have the kind of dramatic impact
on our results. So I wouldn't say that that's really the cause and effect. I
think as long as the air miles stay strong, as long as the economy stays in
reasonable shape, and people continue to fly business aircraft and buy business
aircraft, Defense & Space business, like I said, we're already more than
half booked for the next 18 months. Things can always change. But overall,
we're not -- this is not an area where we're concerned. And we should have very
good visibility to Q3 and Q4. Obviously, this is a long-cycle business. Short
cycle continues to look strong. So overall, I don't think that this is some
kind of a blip or unusual event here in Q2. I think this is evidence that our
strategies are working and that the aero team is executing.

JOSHUA CHARLES POKRZYWINSKI: Got it. That's helpful. And
then just back on the topic of inventory. I know that that's clearly driving
some of the activity in SPS. But as you look back on maybe the second half of
'18, are there any businesses, that now with the benefit of hindsight, you can
say maybe we saw distributors take on more inventory than perhaps they were
selling through, and it's something where we're watching a channel here and
there that you can share with us or we should keep in mind as we go into the
second half?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Like you said, hindsight's always
2020. I mean, I think they have the distributors, to some extent, play the same
role we do, is they want to be prepared for good markets and they want to be
prepared to sell out products. So could you say that they took on a bit more
inventory than they should have? Well, yes. I mean, in hindsight, that's sort
of -- that's clearly the case. And yes, and you're right, we are watching days
of inventory. We are bringing that down. It came out in Q1. It came down in Q2.
We're planning to -- begin to come down in Q3 and get it to a much more lower
level. That's really kind of if we want to kind of focus around the punch --
negative punchline of the quarter. And overall, I think this was a very strong
quarter for Honeywell. But if we want to focus on the negative, which is fair,
that's really the punch line, is we've got to get those inventory levels
moderated to levels that our distributors are comfortable with. And we planned
that for the first half, got a little bit more to do in Q3, and we'll see
around Q4. Obviously, the variable, we don't know is sales out because if that
goes up, then we have less of a problem. It goes down, well, we'll have more
work to do. So that's sort of -- so short answer is, yes, we're monitoring it,
and we're going to have to be very closely watching it here for, well, forever,
but certainly for the second half of this year.

OPERATOR: And that concludes today's question-and-answer
session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius
Adamczyk for any additional closing remarks.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: I want to thank our share owners for
their trust and support of Honeywell. We have made great strides in 2019, but
we still have a long runway to continue our progress. We are focused on
continuing to outperform for our share owners, our customers and our employees.
This quarter marks the start of a new era for Honeywell in Charlotte, North
Carolina, and I could not be more excited about what lies ahead for this
company. Thank you all for listening, and have a wonderful, relaxing and safe
rest of the summer. Take care. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. This does conclude today's
teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful
day.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
Honeywell's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's
conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead, sir.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank
you, April. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's First Quarter 2019
Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Darius
Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis.

This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP
reconciliations, are available on our website at 

.

Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking
statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses
as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we ask that you interpret
them in that light. We identify any principal risks and uncertainties that may
affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.

For this call, references to adjusted earnings per share,
adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate
exclude the impacts from separation cost related to the 2 spin-offs of our
Homes and Transportation Systems businesses in 2018 as well as pension
mark-to-market adjustment and U.S. tax legislation, except where otherwise
noted. References to 2019 adjusted free cash flow guidance and associated
conversion exclude impact from separation costs related to the 2018 spin-offs.

This morning, we will review our financial results for the
first quarter of 2019, share our guidance for the second quarter and provide an
update to our full year 2019 outlook. And as always, we'll leave time for your
questions at the end.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chairman and
CEO, Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, CEO &
PRESIDENT, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.
Let's begin on Slide 2.

Honeywell had a tremendous first quarter, delivering
earnings per share of $1.92 or $0.07 above the high end of our guidance range
and up 13% excluding the impact of the spins in 2018. The strong earnings
performance was driven by organic sales growth of 8% and 120 basis points of
segment margin expansion.

Our outstanding top line results were driven by continued
strength in our long-cycle commercial aerospace, defense and warehouse and
process automations businesses. In addition, we achieved a significant
improvement in Honeywell Building Technologies, which delivered 9% organic
sales growth in this quarter. The first full quarter following our 2018
spin-offs, after 1% in the fourth quarter of 2018, for all of Honeywell, our
long-cycle backlog increased more than 10% year-over-year and continues to
position us well for the remainder of 2019.

The investments we made in our sales organization, new
product development and M&A in the warehouse automation business, coupled
with our winning positions under right platforms in Aerospace continued to
drive outstanding top line results. Segment margin exceeded 20% in the first
quarter driven by smart portfolio enhancements made in 2018, continued
investments in sales excellence, increased sales volumes and the benefits of
previously funded repositioning projects.

I'm also encouraged by the improvement of gross margin,
which increased 300 basis points in the first quarter. Our concerted efforts to
improve working capital generated adjusted free cash flow of 55 -- growth of
55% excluding separation costs and the impact of the spins in 2018.

Conversion in the first quarter was 82%, the highest start
to the year since 2010. It represented a 14-point year-over-year improvement.
I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made in this area while
continuing to invest in our business.

As a result of our first quarter results and continued
confidence in our ability to deliver, today we're raising our full year organic
sales guidance to a new range of 3% to 6% and earnings per share guidance to a
new range of $7.90 to $8.15. We continue to expect to generate nearly $6
billion in free cash flow with conversion in the range of 95% to 100%.

As I said in January, Honeywell is a simpler, more focused company
that continues to overdeliver on its commitments. We are encouraged by our
results, particularly with organic sales growth and free cash flow, which were
2 of my top priorities when I took over as CEO. Notwithstanding the strong
start to the year, we continue to take steps to ensure we can deliver on our
commitments in a potentially uncertain macro environment should things slow
down in the second half of 2019.

We took significant actions in 2018 to transform the
business, the results of which you see in our performance today. A combination
of strong sales growth, favorable end-market exposure and significant balance
sheet positions us well for the remainder of 2019.

I'll stop there and turn the call over to Greg who will
discuss our first quarter results and updated 2019 guidance in more detail.

GREGORY P. LEWIS, SENIOR VP & CFO, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to
begin on Slide 3. As Darius mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter
across all of our businesses. 8% organic sales growth was the highest we've
seen since 2011 and an acceleration from 6% in the fourth quarter of 2018. All
of the markets we serve remain strong.

A few highlights to mention. Commercial Aviation OE grew 10%
organically driven by demand for new business jet platforms. Defense &
Space grew 13%, continuing the trend of strong double-digit sales growth.
Building Technologies grew 9% organically with strength in commercial fire and
security as well as in Building Solutions, particularly in India and China. And
our warehouse automation and sensing and IoT businesses delivered another
quarter of double-digit organic sales growth, just as they did throughout 2018,
leading to 10% organic sales growth in Safety and Productivity Solutions.

The impact of the spin-offs of our Homes and Transportation
Systems businesses, both lower margins than the portfolio, contributed 80 basis
points of segment margin expansion this quarter. The remaining 40 basis points
was the result of our strong operational performance, continued investments in
commercial excellence initiatives and increased sales volumes.

We continue to effectively manage the impact of tariffs and
material and labor inflation through our ongoing mitigation efforts, and we've
made further progress on the elimination of all spin-related stranded costs by
the end of 2019. However, we did see some volume declines in our Productivity
Products business, which contributed to lower margin in SPS in the quarter.
I'll discuss that in more detail shortly.

The majority of our earnings growth, $0.15 this quarter,
came from segment profit improvement. We realized a $0.06 benefit from our
share repurchase program, which resulted in a weighted average share count of
739 million shares in the quarter. Consistent with our first quarter guidance,
our effective tax rate was approximately 22%, which generated a $0.04 benefit
year-over-year. You will find a bridge of our first quarter earnings per share
in the appendix of this presentation.

And finally, adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter
was $1.2 billion, up 55% excluding separation cost and the impact of the spins.
As Darius mentioned, we continue to see strong cash generation, particularly in
Performance Materials and Technologies and Aerospace in the quarter. We are
very pleased with our results across the board.

Now let's turn to Slide 4 and discuss our segment
performance.

Beginning with Aerospace. With sales up 10% on an organic
basis, we continue to perform extremely well in today's robust demand
environment driven by our strong positions on the right platforms. Notably,
this marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth for
Aerospace.

Defense & Space grew 13% organically led by continued
global demand for sensors and guidance systems, increased spares volumes on the
U.S. DOD defense programs and robust shipment volumes on key OE programs,
including the F-35.

Commercial OE sales were up 10% organically with increased
ship set volumes across all Gulfstream platforms, increased avionics deliveries
on the Dassault F900 and F2000 aircraft and increased engine shipments for the
Textron Longitude. We expect this momentum to continue in the coming quarters.

In the commercial aftermarket, sales were up 8% organically
driven by strong global airline demand and tailwinds from ADSP's safety
mandates. In addition, we saw robust connected aircraft growth driven by demand
for JetWave and business jet software offerings.

Aerospace segment margin expanded by 260 basis points driven
by commercial excellence and margin accretion from the spin of Transportation
Systems. The spin contributed about 80 basis points of Aero's total margin
expansion.

Before we move on, I just want to take a moment to address
questions we received regarding the unfortunate events surrounding Boeing's 737
MAX aircraft. At this time, based on our customer's current production
schedules, we do not anticipate a significant impact to our 2019 results. We
will continue to monitor the situation as we move throughout the year.

Now moving to Honeywell Building Technologies. Organic sales
growth was 9% driven by strength in commercial fire products and improved
demand for our security offerings. We saw robust demand for our Niagara
software platform as well as further improvement in supply chain execution,
which had been impacted in the back half of 2018 by the spins.

Projects growth in Building Solutions was also strong,
particularly for international airport installations in the Middle East and
Asia Pacific. The projects backlog in Building Solutions was up over 15% at the
end of the first quarter.

Stepping back for a minute. This quarter's performance is a
result of specific actions taken by the new HBT leadership team, which is
moving the business in the right direction. The team is building out its sales
force and capacity, investing in innovation, and they're executing the
commercial excellence playbook to deploy and train a high-quality sales team.
They're also focused on improving delivery and execution and are making steady
progress to eliminate the remaining stranded costs related to the Home spin.

HBT segment margins expanded 240 basis points in the first
quarter driven by the favorable impact from the spin-off of the Homes business.
Overall, we are very pleased with their first quarter and are encouraged for
the future.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were up 5%
on an organic basis. Process Solutions, sales were up 7% organically driven by
broad-based demand in automation, including for our maintenance and migration
services and field instrumentation devices. Orders in HPS grew at a
double-digit rate for the third straight quarter.

In Advanced Materials, sales were up 4% organically from
ongoing demand for Fluorine Products, including for our Solstice line of low
global-warming refrigerants and blowing agents.

UOP sales were up 1% organically for the quarter driven by
demand in gas processing and hydrogen particularly -- partially offset by a
tough year-over-year sales comparable and licensing and timing-related decline
in catalyst shipments. We again saw strong orders and backlog growth in UOP, up
6% and 8% organically across engineering, equipment and catalyst, which is a
positive sign for future sales growth.

PMT segment margins expanded 140 basis points in the first
quarter driven by commercial excellence, higher sales volumes and productivity,
including the benefits of previously funded restructuring. This largely offset
the impact of material and labor inflation.

Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were up
10% on an organic basis. Intelligrated continued to outperform with another
strong quarter of double-digit sales growth driven by the conversion of our
major systems backlog, aftermarket services and increased demand for Vocollect voice
solutions. We also saw double-digit sales growth in our sensing and IoT
business, which was a continuation of the double-digit growth they achieved in
2018. Our China business also generated double-digit sales growth.

Productivity sales -- Productivity Solutions sales growth
was partially offset by decreased volumes of scanning and mobility products due
to slower project ramp-ups and planned distributor destocking, mostly in North
America. We highlighted this potential weakness in the business in early March.
We anticipate that the Productivity Products business will improve in the
second half of the year but are planning conservatively in the second quarter
given the decline we experienced in Q1.

Moving to the Safety business, sales were approximately flat
on an organic basis. Growth for Gas Detection products and retail footwear was
offset by softer demand for general safety products and personal protective
equipment.

SPS segment margins contracted 260 basis points driven by
decreased productivity products, short-cycle volumes, the impact of inflation
and unfavorable mix, stemming from the significantly higher sales in our
warehouse and automation business, which offset benefits from commercial
excellence and productivity.

Overall, the trends in our end markets are largely
consistent with what we discussed in February. We remain confident in our
businesses, and our view is supported by strong long-cycle orders and backlog
growth. Our focus on smart growth investments, breakthrough initiatives and new
product development, coupled with continued productivity rigor, has positioned
us well for the remainder of 2019.

With that, let's move to Slide 5, and we can discuss our
second quarter outlook.

Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate that the
business environment will be largely similar to Q1 with strength primarily
coming from our long-cycle portfolio in commercial aerospace, defense and
warehouse automation.

In Aerospace, we continue to see robust demand in both
commercial aerospace and defense with growth in narrowbody production rates and
increased business jet deliveries as several new models have recently entered
into service. We expect the commercial aftermarket to continue to be strong
driven by flight hours, airline demand and further tailwinds from the adoption
of safety and compliance mandates. The industry dynamics in defense should be
-- should continue to be positive, both in the U.S. and abroad.

In Building Technologies, we anticipate continued momentum
in commercial fire and security. The second quarter typically encompasses the
peak season for demand in these markets. We expect continued conversion of our
long-cycle backlog in Building Solutions and growth in services.

In PMT, orders and backlog growth in UOP and in the
automation businesses and Process Solutions should drive another quarter of
strong sales growth in Q2.

In HPS, we expect continued short-cycle demand in
maintenance and migration services and field instrumentation devices. And UOP
growth will be driven by licensing, engineering and gas processing demand
while, in Advanced Materials, we expect to see continued adoption of Solstice
products in refrigerants and foam applications.

Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, we expect the
strong e-commerce and warehouse distribution macro trend to continue as well as
growth in maintenance, services and voice solutions. We're expecting additional
destocking in our distributor channel will drive a decline in mobility,
scanning and print in the quarter. On the Safety side, growth should improve
sequentially in both Gas Detection and personal protective equipment, and we
anticipate continued demand in the retail footwear business.

For total Honeywell, the net below-the-line impact, which is
the difference between segment profit and income before tax will be
approximately a positive $30 million to $40 million next quarter driven by
increased interest income and benefits from the spins' indemnification payments
related to asbestos and environmental expenses, partially offset by lower
pension income due to the 2018 pension derisking actions we took, all as
previously guided.

Our guidance assumes a weighted average share count of 734
million shares and effective tax rate of about 22% and earnings dilution from
the 2018 spin of approximately $0.19 in the quarter.

Now let's turn to Slide 6, and we can discuss our revised
full year guidance.

We have revised our full year sales and earnings per share
guidance to reflect our strong outperformance in the first quarter. We continue
to be encouraged by our business performance and outlook. However, we are
remaining cautious with regards to the short-cycle portion of our portfolio
given the macro uncertainties that remain in the second half of the year.

We are raising our full year organic sales guidance by 1
point on both the low and the high end to a new range of 3% to 6%. Our segment
margin expansion and free cash flow guidance are unchanged. We remain on track
to deliver 95% to 100% free cash flow conversion while investing in the
business through higher-return CapEx and research and development. The revised
earnings per share guidance represents earnings growth of 7% to 10% excluding
the impact of the spins in 2018.

We continue to expect no significant impact in 2019 related
to tariffs. We have mitigation actions in place, including to address the
impact of potential tariffs on all remaining items imported from China. We are
also closely monitoring the potential effects of Brexit in our operations and
are communicating regularly with our customers, partners and suppliers around
these plans. We are planning for various potential Brexit outcomes including a
no-deal Brexit scenario to ensure that as the terms of the U.K.'s departure
from the EU are finalized, we are best positioned to continue meeting our
customers' needs.

Our guidance continues to reflect a weighted average share
count of approximately 731 million shares and an effective tax rate of
approximately 22%. Our net below-the-line expenses are now expected to be in
the range of $60 million to $70 million of net expense in 2019, slightly down
from our original estimate of $80 million in net expense. The minor change is
due to slightly higher full year estimates for both pension and interest
income.

With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius,
who will wrap up on Slide 7.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Thanks, Greg. The first quarter was an
outstanding start to 2019 for Honeywell. We continue to execute on our
commitments to shareholders and accelerate organic growth from last quarter. We
have winning positions in attractive end markets with multiple levers to
deliver continued margin expansion. Our operational performance is driving
adjusted free cash flow growth and conversion. All of this, combined with
innovative new product offerings and a strong backlog, positions us well for
the second quarter.

We're continuing the business transformation initiatives I
outlined during our outlook call, including in Honeywell digital, a unified
software business in Honeywell Connected Enterprise and the increased focus on
improving our supply chain execution. You will hear more about this and other
exciting things happening in Honeywell at our 2019 Annual Investor Conference,
which will take place on May 14.

With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.

MARK MACALUSO: Thanks, Darius. Both Darius and Greg are now
available to answer any questions. April, if you could, please open the line
for Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is
coming from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: So just kind of doing the -- a lot of companies betting on kind of a
back-half acceleration. You guys are just mechanically kind of the opposite and
just doing the normal seasonality analysis around the businesses. Is there
anything specifically that worries you in the second half because I'm getting
to obviously something that's a lot higher, based on just basic normal seasonal
analysis on both organic as well as the EPS numbers. And obviously, this wasn't
a perfect quarter given PMT and UOP, which, seemingly, with the backlog should
bounce back nicely and maybe have a bit of a slowing in other business, I don't
know. Just curious if there's anything that kind of stands out that you're concerned
about in the second half of the year.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I guess I'll start. I mean I don't
know that there's anything that really concerns me in the second half of the
year. I think what's an unknown in the second half of the year is short-cycle
business. I mean that's sort of the big unknown. And I think the signals are
mixed. I mean I think overall, we're pleased with our outcome in Q1, but the
short-cycle business is that -- is very much that, short cycle and all. But
things looked good in Q1. They can look very, very different in the second
half. You know what? On PMT, I don't know, Steve. I'm pretty happy with the PMT
outcome for Q1. Whether you look at bookings, revenues, margin expansion, I'm
not sure I'm really disappointed with those results at all. I'm actually very,
very pleased. And when you think about things like HPS projects up strong
double digits, backlog up, our book to bill up 1.2 in the long-cycle business,
I don't know that I can -- that there's much to be disappointed about there.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Yes. I guess my only point was on UOP.
It was kind of flattish this quarter. And it should accelerate. There are
reasons for it to accelerate. So I'm saying that's not a reason for it to be --
for revenues to be weaker in the second half of the year. Okay. That makes some
sense. Just lastly on -- to nitpick here on SPS. What is going on with the
productivity business? I mean the tone at ProMat sounded reasonably positive.
Is there anything going on with the launch of Mobility Edge that's kind of
moving around a little bit? Just curious. A little more color on the SPS
business because that was a little bit weaker than we were expecting.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think that's fair. Yes, I think a
couple of things. The first one being we had some destocking in our -- with our
distributors. We anticipated some of that. Frankly, it was a little bit greater
than we had anticipated. And we think that that's actually going to continue in
Q2. When you look at the product subsegments, it's actually the mobility did
okay. It was -- we looked at the sell-through figures for productivity
products, the mobility did quite well. It was probably more of an issue on the
destocking on the scanning, and that's where we saw a little bit of the pain points.
But I will tell you that in the second half of the year, we are anticipating
growth in that business. We anticipate filling some larger orders, and the
destocking situation should normalize. So, yes, this -- Q1 wasn't exactly what
we had hoped for, but I'm also bullish on the long term of the business.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. Sorry. One more quick one. Have
your priorities on capital allocation changed at all? Are you guys, given where
multiples are today, are you thinking maybe a little more buyback than
acquisitions? Are you still on the hunt with this pipeline?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. No. I think it's just --
unfortunately, the environment hasn't change. I mean we would like to steer
more of our deployment towards M&A, but I'm also trying to stay
disciplined, and the multiples continue to be high. So something is going to
have to give. But having said that, we have been deploying more towards
buybacks, and we deployed a lot last year. Average share purchase price was
right around $150, and that includes -- that's prior to the spin-off of Garrett
and Resideo. So if you look at where we are today, I think that's proven to be
a pretty good investment. And we continue with another $750 million in Q1,
which also looks to be -- and I think when in doubt, bet on yourself. Because
there's -- we feel great about the company. We feel great about our prospects.
We're going to continue to perform as indicated by our backlog positions, our
bookings and so on. We're very confident Honeywell is going to continue to
perform. And thus, a little bit more skewed towards buyback. But don't read
into that, that we're not interested in M&A. We are. We're just trying to
be disciplined and pay good valuations that are reasonable, which is
extraordinarily challenging in this environment and you see in the multiples we
paid.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Yes. When you're beating and raising
and growing 6% to 8%, you can be patient. So I get it.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague
with Vertical Research Partners.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, VERTICAL
RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: Just 2 things from me. First, just back on kind of
channel inventories, maybe more broadly. Is there anything that stands out in
your businesses, especially in the shorter-cycle businesses where there was
some type of prebuy or something that's created elevated inventory that you're
planning for some kind of give back on beyond what we've seen in Productivity
Solutions? Maybe just the general state of play there and your visibility to
the extent that there is any on the short cycle.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No. There was a little bit in terms of
an ERP prebuy because we had done some ERP conversions. And these, sometimes,
they don't go as smoothly as planned. So we generally had a little bit of a
buy-in, but I don't think that was accelerated. I think it was a little bit of
a mismatch between sellout expectations and buy-in expectations, and that was
particularly pronounced in productivity, especially in our scanning business.
And those things just take a little bit of time to normalize. And we're very
confident that the portfolio has got a new set of products coming out here
again, particularly in the warehouse and distribution segment, which we think
is very interesting. So I'm not particularly worried about it. And like I say,
we are projecting growth for the second half. But there isn't sort of something
systematic here that's concerning. And a lot of our HBT portfolio is also short
cycle. And you saw the kind of figures we posted there, and I was extremely
pleased with the kind of organic growth that we saw on HBT, which is also
primarily a short-cycle business as well other than the HP -- yes, as projects
[confirm].

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: And then secondly, unrelated, just on
the project-related work in general, in Process and where it may spill into gas
processing in UOP, just kind of what is the nature of the activity you're
seeing? Does any particular subvertical jump out? Meaning, refining or LNG or
the like. And just any color there on kind of your forward pipeline would be
interesting.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean I think the LNG segment is
-- continue to be active. And we're waiting with some final investment
decisions to be upcoming. But whether it's UOP business, which participates
there as well as HPS, that's continued to be a very active segment. Our gas
processing business -- and although this kind of -- this price of oil may stay
unconventional segment appealing, there's also a greater level of discipline by
a lot of the unconventional players in terms of cash generation, which there
used to be a bit more build out the infrastructure drill and so on. Now they
want to be self-sustaining in terms of their cash flow. So the environment is
good, but it's also a little bit more disciplined. But anytime you see this
kind of depreciation in the price of oil, we feel pretty good about the entire
PMT segment. Refining with the clean fuel segment, that also continues to be an
opportunity, particularly in segments like Latin America. Then of course, clean
fuels, for shipping as well. So sort of broad-based strength. And whenever you
get to this kind of an oil price, we feel very confident in the outlook for
PMT.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Scott Davis with
Melius Research.

SCOTT REED DAVIS, FOUNDING PARTNER, CHAIRMAN, CEO &
RESEARCH ANALYST OF MULTI-INDUSTRY RESEARCH, MELIUS RESEARCH LLC: There's not
much to pick on in this quarter, for sure. Are you guys surprised that -- just
kind of the pace of how strong things were? I mean China was supposed to be a
little slower. Europe was supposed to be a little bit slower. It doesn't seem
that happened at all to you guys though. Can you give some color maybe, Darius,
around the world what you saw?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes, Scott. This is Greg. I mean I think
we were pretty pleased with what we saw across the globe. As you mentioned, the
U.S., obviously, a large part of our growth was up double digits. Europe
continued to be good for us. I'd say mid-single digits as well. Middle East,
very strong, up strong double digits in virtually every business. China for us
was down slightly, but that was really not structural in nature. We've had some
very large wins in UOP that we're burning off some backlog on. So the remainder
of the businesses were up double digits in both HBT and SPS, for example, in
China. PMT down a bit. We expect that to turn positive. And I think we guided
low single digits in China for the year in the last call, and I still think
that's probably about right for us. India was a very strong story for us again
across all businesses, up double digits. So I think on balance, we had a very
good performance. Obviously, the 8% total top line better than we had
anticipated with all of those cylinders firing in the same direction at once.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Just to add to that maybe is, I
just would highlight the HBT performance. I mean I think we're starting to see
the seeds of better performance in HBT. And when you take the 9% number, I
think that makes us feel good. We've got some more NPD coming, particularly
even more so in the second half of the year than the first. So I'm very
optimistic in terms of what we're seeing in that business. And overall, the
environment is good. I mean I think the market didn't quite get this right in
December. I mean I think that December was doom and gloom, and the recession is
here. And as you can see by our results in Q1 and as Greg pointed out, you see
kind of strength across the globe. We didn't have a market that really stood
out to us and said, "Okay, that's a train wreck." I mean everything
was either up or up a lot. So overall, we're pleased with what we're seeing so
far.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes. The only thing I would mention, too,
is back to the second half and our views there is, some of the macro risks,
let's say, they're not gone, they just got pushed to the right. Brexit is an
example. The U.S.-China trade situation. So things that we thought might have
perhaps come to a conclusion in Q1 just haven't. They're now pushed to the
right. And I think that's also kind of helped from a market [sense]
perspective.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Good color. Just switching gears a little
bit. The connected enterprise initiative, how much of a headwind is that on
margins right now? Or has that turned into more of a neutral?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No. That's actually accretive to what we
do. And by the way, that grew in the teens again. So that's...

SCOTT REED DAVIS: I'm sorry. I meant the ERP -- your ERP
rollout, not the -- not your growth initiative.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Oh, sorry. ERP rollouts, we're in very
good shape. Yes. I mean we continued to move down the path. We talked about the
fact that we've -- we're at 148. I think we finished at -- in 2016, we finished
at 71. And we're probably going to take out another 20 or so this year on our
path to getting down to 10 core platforms by 2021. And we continue to make good
progress there. Lots of -- as you can imagine, lots of integrated planning
going on to make sure that there is business readiness. We've got obviously all
the IT readiness there but we've got to always manage the change that goes
along with the combination of ERP moves and business requirements. But we feel
very good where we are. It's not been disruptive. And I think we've got a good solid
plan to make sure that we don't put too much in any one quarter or in any one
business to add business risks.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Okay. But it still is a mathematical
headwind though? Is that correct, Greg?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: When you say mathematical headwind, what
do you mean?

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Just on the payback. I mean are you at the
point yet where the payback is greater than what your dollar output is?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Oh, yes. I mean from a savings and a
cost-out perspective, we're now at a place where our run rate cost savings is
certainly ramped up. We're -- 93% of our revenues are on our core 10 platforms.
So we have hit the majority of the scale that I would say that we're going to
get from a cost productivity perspective. And most of the things that were kind
of remaining on the road map are cleaning up more of the smaller items.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: I think if you were to look at this,
Scott, on a year-over-year basis, the impact is, I would say, very, very
slightly accretive but negligibly so.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes. I mean the run rate of deployment
costs that we've got in the P&L is roughly flat year-on-year. And each
year, we're obviously adding some run rate benefits to the P&L overall.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu
from Jefferies.

SHEILA KARIN KAHYAOGLU, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: In terms of margin expansion guidance for the full year,
Aero and HBT are tracking well ahead of that. PMT is at the high end of the
range. How do we think about continued run rate from here on margin expansion?
And maybe as my follow-up, on SPS, I understand margin mix pressure and maybe a
little bit of inflation. How does that play out throughout the rest of 2019?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes. So Sheila, our guidance for the year
remains at 30 to 60 basis points, I believe, at this point. We've talked about
that being our framework. And what we continue to do is add initiatives and
elements to be able to continue having that runway in front of us. And so with
things like our connected enterprise growth, which is margin-accretive from a
software business perspective with our digital transformation efforts, Scott
just mentioned things like the productivity around ERP deployments as well as
just our HOS Gold playbook that's driving commercial excellence into each of
the businesses and then again our continual repositioning pipeline. We see our
-- we see that 30 to 50 basis points framework that we've laid out as very much
sustainable over the coming years. So on a portfolio basis, we feel very good
about where we are in that regard. Now as we mentioned, with this year, we're
always talking about the elimination of stranded costs. We continue to see some
of that impact in the first part of this year, and that will dissipate. We've
talked about having those stranded costs eliminated by the time we get to the
end of 2019, and that will be fully behind us. So broadly speaking, very -- we
feel very good about the margin expansion potential. It is a portfolio. And
different quarters and years, some businesses will have more or less
opportunity depending on where they are in particular. And then as it relates
to SPS and the mix component, with very high growth in the Intelligrated
business as when we bought it, it started out below the line average for
margins, and we continue to improve that as we've integrated that business, but
it is still below the line average for the rest of the segment. And so as we
get through the destocking in productivity products and we normalize, let's say,
to perhaps growth rates that aren't multiples of double digits per quarter in
Intelligrated, we expect to see that SPS margin rate continue to improve
throughout the year.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think maybe just to add a couple
of things. The framework has changed a little bit. What you're seeing is you're
seeing a much stronger organic growth rate. And a margin rate increase still
that's very much within what we committed long term to our investors, which is
the 30 to 50. We're like smack right in the middle of that but at a rate -- at
a growth rate that's substantially higher. But if you're concerned about sort
of our continuing to focus on margins, there is no need to be concerned there
because we have plenty of levers, even just from purely a productivity
perspective, whether we think about ERP discussions we had before, the
simplification in our ISC performance and, overall, making that much more
simple. Direct material productivity, we think we have more room for
improvement there as well. We're going to continue to find restructuring, just
like what we did this quarter, and we anticipate doing more of that in the
second half of the year as well as Q2. And then we still have some stranded
costs to go to take out, both in HBT as well as corporate. So we have a lot of
room in terms of productivity. We were hurt a little bit in Q1 because our
Intelligrated business is growing. When I say strong double digits, I mean
really, think really strong double digits, and that's not helping the mix. But
overall, we're not going to step back from something just because it's lower
margin when you can run it with negative cash flow as well as that kind of an
expansion, which will ultimately turn to a higher-margin business once we
establish that installed base.

OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with
RBC Capital Markets.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: I know Greg touched on this in the prepared remarks on the
737 MAX, and I also know you guys don't disclose any of the dollar on the ship
sets. But just could you share with us what's on the platform? And maybe what
your assumptions are? And how this plays out where it does not impact your 2019
guidance?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, I think our assumption is
exactly what Boeing laid out, which is the reduction in the production rates.
We've encompassed that. We have numerous systems on the plane. We do expect
that the delivery of these planes and that production rate to resume in the
second half of this year. But as Greg pointed out, the impact for us is
negligible, certainly for Q2. And I think given that most -- just about
everybody expects a resolution, we do too. We think that's a terrific aircraft
that's going to be back up and flying in the second half of the year. So I
think there's really nothing more to add than that.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: Great. That's helpful. And then one of
the soft spots in the fourth quarter was the whole China air and water dynamic
for HBT. It didn't sound like that carried into this quarter. But if you could
update us there, has that normalized? And what are you assuming for 2019?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No, actually, air and water, to be
honest, didn't have a great quarter in Q1. But overall, HBT did. So what's even
more impressive about their performance, despite a challenged performance in
air and water, HBT still grew 9%. So I'm actually not discouraged by that. I'm
very encouraged by that. But overall, I would say the air and water segment is
inconsequential in terms of overall Honeywell performance. And -- but it was a
headwind to HBT in Q1, and they still grew 9%. So I view that as a very
positive outcome.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell
with Barclays.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe first question around the margin profile at HBT. I
think you had called out what the ex spins margin performance was year-on-year
in Aerospace. Maybe just give that number in HBT as well in Q1, and apologies
if I had missed that. And then also, when you're looking forwards for HBT,
given the fairly high Building Solutions weighting in the sales mix, how do you
think about incremental margins for HBT overall and managing that solutions mix
moving around?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes. Thanks, Julian. So yes, in terms of
HBT, margins actually were down, ex the spins in the quarter, about 100 basis
points. And as we talked about the -- stranded costs are still an impact to
them. When you think about our stranded costs overall, it was about 60-40
between corp and the businesses. So HBT is still digging out of a little bit of
the stranded cost hole, particularly in some of the factory aspects that they
have there. So that, we again expect to remediate over the course of the remaining
quarters. And then in terms of the mix of products versus projects, certainly
just like we have in our other businesses, it's no different than in PMT. And
even as we were talking about with SPS, we do -- the projects business is a
meaningful part of HBT and carries a lower profile than the product side as
well. So we're always going to be managing through the mix of that overall. But
we see -- where we landed for the quarter, I think we were around 20 points in
margin for HBT overall, and we do see that progressing throughout the year.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL: And then just settling back on the
overall top line. I was intrigued on the guidance. You took up the high end of
the organic sales growth guide. So I just wondered -- I understand why the low
end was...

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: We took up lows too. We took up a 1
point on the high end and 1 point on the low end.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL: Yes. So I understand that the low end
would go up because you have a very good Q1 print now in the bag. But taking up
the high end, that would imply no slowdown year-on-year for 2019 as a whole. I
just wondered if there were any specific end markets or businesses that drove
that increase at the high end.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I would say it's our long-cycle
businesses. So whether we talk about PMT, we talk about the segments of
Aerospace. HBT, we had a very strong booking quarter. And our book to bill was
1.2, which was also very helpful. So what we're -- what gave us the confidence
for the rest of the year in raising the guidance was the long-cycle bookings.
Short cycle, I still will say is unpredictable. I mean I think our visibility
there is relatively unknown, especially for the second half. And I think there
is a little bit of caution that we still have it in terms of our second half
outlook on short cycle. We'll see how that evolves. I think you'll see some of
the other commentary by some of our competitors and so on. And we're not seeing
it in terms of the challenges, but that doesn't mean that they can't and won't
exist. But based on what we're seeing in the business, we remain relatively
bullish. And that's what gave us that confidence in raising the bottom and the
top.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with
Deutsche Bank.

NICOLE SHEREE DEBLASE, DIRECTOR & LEAD ANALYST, DEUTSCHE
BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I guess maybe starting with UOP. If we can kind
of go through with the outlook over the rest of the year, backlog up 8%. I know
you guys have some tough callous comps that you're facing. That's what drove
the 1Q, I guess, slight weakness versus backlog growth. If you could talk about
when we should expect UOP organic growth to accelerate.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, we expect it in the second half of
the year. I mean I think what's important to point out is we had some very
challenging year-over-year comps, especially with our China bookings and
revenue conversion. That is what drove that. But UOP had a very good orders
growth. I mean mid-single-digit kind of orders growth. So there is nothing to
me in UOP that's screaming a problem. Yes, I mean the year-over-year revenue
growth was a little bit flattish but, again, driven more a little bit by tough
comps and timing. But the number that I always look at for those long-cycle
businesses is orders, and that's mid-single digit with a strong pipeline. And
I'm -- this is not an area of worry for me.

NICOLE SHEREE DEBLASE: Got it, Darius. And maybe a second
question around SPS organic growth outlook. So I know the Intelligrated comps
are becoming pretty difficult. And I think they get difficult throughout the
year, if I'm correct, correct me if I'm wrong. How do we kind of balance that
against improved -- potential improvement in Productivity Solutions as we get
through this destocking? Should we think of the high single-digit growth as
potentially sustainable within SPS so long as the short-cycle trends behave?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, I think you captured it exactly
correctly. I think Intelligrated is going to have tougher and tougher comps as
we get deeper into the year in Q2, Q3 and Q4. I mean I only dream that they
have another quarter like Q1, but that's probably not completely realistic. So
their growth on a year-over-year basis is going to be slower, but it's going to
be there. But that would -- should get offset by some of the other segments of
the SPS portfolio, particularly in the second half, namely productivity
products and industrial safety. So we think that, that will balance out, and
we're going to continue to see a rate of growth in SPS, which is, I think, mid-
to upper single digits for the year. So that's our expectation right now based
on what we're seeing.

OPERATOR: Our next question is coming from Andy Kaplowitz
with Citi.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ, MD AND U.S. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR HEAD,
CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: There is 8% Commercial Aviation organic
aftermarket growth. It's the fastest growth we've seen from Honeywell this
cycle when we know aftermarket growth has been a particular focus of the Aero
team. But where has that improvement versus global flight hours come from? You
did mention safety mandates are helping. But is it the uptick in
performance-based contracting and increasing growth from connected aero that is
also helping in this field? Would you agree that the trends toward continuing
improved aftermarket growth for Honeywell look sustainable moving forward?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean I think you've captured a
couple of the big levers where the growth is coming from because we're moving
away from just fixed-rate kind of an aftermarket growth. That's certainly a
good part of it. But the other part of it is what I call the proactive
aftermarket growth, which is much more around connected aircraft, around RMUs,
which generate a lot of value for our customers. As you know, we made a
substantial investment in the aftermarket -- primarily in the aftermarket sales
team I think going back to 2 to 2.5 years ago, where we added now almost 250
sales professionals focused on driving proactive aftermarket sales. And that
you're seeing the benefits of that coming through. So it's both an effort in
terms of generating proactive and investing in R&D to generate these RMUs,
which our sales professionals sell, and then obviously accelerated growth in
our Connected Aircraft platform. Those are the 2 big drivers. And I don't see
any reason why that isn't sustainable.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ: And, Darius, maybe just staying on
Aero for a second. Can you give us some more color on your commentary regarding
commercial excellence driving margin improvements? Where are you in terms of
alleviating supplier constraints within Aero? How much more room is there
within Aero to take G&A and fixed costs in general out? And should we be
thinking that margin for the year could be a fair amount higher than, I think
you had guided 24% last quarter for the year?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Sure. Maybe let me try that one on. When
you think about our commercial excellence efforts, I would think about that
less as a cost-reduction effort because what we're trying to do is enable our
sales team to be more effective, ensure that we're deploying and redeploying
sales resources into the right spots. And actually, we're investing in things
like training to be able to make these sales associates more effective in the
markets that they're in with the products and solutions that they're selling.
So we think about commercial excellence less as, "I'm trying to take costs
out" and more about, "I'm trying to drive seller productivity and
growth". So I don't know, Darius, if you'd add to that.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No. I think I'd agree with that. But as
always, we always balance everything with growth in commercial levers and
productivity levers and put some money to work for restructuring pipeline in
Aero last year, and we're going to continue to do that. But yes, when we say
commercial excellence, we really mean driving productivity and outcomes growth
on the front end of the business.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ: And Greg, it's fair to say that, that
24% guide looks conservative now after a strong start?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: I'm sorry. The what?

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ: The 24% guide for the year looks
conservative after a strong start to the year in Aero.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Oh, it was and it's -- I think we feel
good about the place Aerospace is, in terms of their margin expansion
potential. And that's an area that gives us a lot of confidence for our overall
guidance range for the company.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe
Research.

NIGEL EDWARD COE, MD & SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, WOLFE
RESEARCH, LLC: So you covered a lot of ground here already. HBT, the
acceleration is obviously a big break in the trends. And I'm just curious,
given the separation of Resideo, was -- that was a carve-out from the business.
Do you think that the distraction around that was a factor why sales last year
were a little bit weaker and now we're seeing that strength? And then maybe
just address China because China's obviously where we've seen a lot of
stimulus, where we've seen some improvement in the product now over there. How
important is China acceleration in the HBT performance?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. A couple of factors. On the
management distraction, there is no doubt that the Resideo was a heavy lift
last year for the HBT team. I mean the amount of separation work that had to be
done to create Resideo, particularly vis-ÃÂ -vis Garrett, is incredible. So
I think that, that team just did an outstanding job in enabling Resideo to
exist, and I think I continue to be very impressed by what they have done. Now
I wouldn't say -- was it a distraction? Yes. Did it take their eye off the ball
on growth? I don't think so. But I -- they certainly have more time to do that
this year when they can be very focused on the markets, on what's happening.
And that team has done a great job in continuing to move that business forward.
So I'm very pleased. Yes. I mean China is important for our entire business,
not just HBT. It has been there a long time. We want to be a local player. We
are a local player as I talked about multiple times on this call, which is we
very strongly believe in our local strategies where we innovate, where we come
up with ideas, where we manufacture market and sell all in the markets that we
participate in, and that's certainly true in China. And I think that team has
-- the China team in HBT has done a nice job in creating that kind of an
offering so -- with more upside for the future. So overall, I'm not going to
declare any victories after one quarter in HBT. But I certainly loved what I
saw in Q1, and I'm bullish on the future.

NIGEL EDWARD COE: And a quick follow up on Safety, the flat
performance in Safety. It sounds like it's mainly channel inventories, but we
have heard 1 or 2 other players talking about some weakness in Safety. So I'm
just curious what you're seeing there and how that resolves.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: I would characterize it a lot more as
sort of a channel issue rather than anything else. And as we've pointed out,
that's something we need to -- that should alleviate in the first half of the
year, then we should be back at the right place by the second half of this
year.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank
of America.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN, MD, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH
DIVISION: I'm just curious if anybody's going to top your organic growth this
quarter. Let's see what happens there. Question on software growth. Can you
guys -- I mean, you alluded to that. But can you just talk about the growth for
embedded and stand-alone software? And what would stand-alone software business
be in 2019 versus 2018?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, as usual, we're expecting
high teens to 20% growth in our software business. That target has not changed.
We grew in the teens in Q1, so I think we're very much on track. [We kind of
call] the connected enterprise is really transforming. And we're going to be
doing some fun things at Investor Day, I don't want to give too much away, and
the day after in terms of a new launch. You -- for those of you that went to
Hanover, you probably saw a little bit of a hint of that in terms of Honeywell
Forge. But I'm excited by what's going on in -- with that team and what they're
trying to do. And the embedded platform is growing nicely as well. I mean think
mid- to high single-digits growth there as well in a lot of those platforms. So
overall, it's been an area of emphasis for Honeywell. It's going to continue to
be, and we're seeing the results in our P&L.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: You want to talk a little bit about
Honeywell Forge ahead of that Analyst Day?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No. I can't steal all the thunder. I've
got to have something to talk about in May, Andrew. You're going to have to
wait a little bit.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: Let me ask a follow-up question. On 737
MAX, do you think there will be any working capital impact? Just, do you think
Boeing will behave any differently in terms of managing payments to you during
this production ramp down? Should we expect any change in seasonality in
Aerospace?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No. We're not really expecting that. I
mean I think we're trying to be as helpful to Boeing and to NTSB as we can to
get this thing resolved. But no, I think from a financial or payment, I don't
anticipate that will be the case. And I am confident that Boeing is going to
get this issue resolved. And we're their biggest fans, and we're ready to help
in any way we can.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski
with Morgan Stanley.

JOSHUA CHARLES POKRZYWINSKI, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a first question on UOP. I think a few folks have taken
a stab at it here. But Darius, you mentioned some good momentum on the LNG
side. I think one of your competitors has talked about maybe kind of a midyear
order surge. So I guess the question is, despite the good order growth you've
seen, are we still on the leading edge of some of those investments?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, I don't think we need to wait
until midyear. I can tell you without getting precise on the numbers that the
growth in our orders and our projects business in HPS specifically was, let's
just call it, a strong double-digit growth. So I don't think we need to wait
until Q2 or Q3. We've already seen it. And the pipeline remains strong. And
yes, I mean whether it's LNG -- and it's more than LNG because it's
broad-based, but we're very pleased with the kind of orders we've already
booked, much less what's maybe in the pipeline.

JOSHUA CHARLES POKRZYWINSKI: And does that start to hit in
the second half? I guess it doesn't really look like there's much in 2Q, just
examining guidance.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: You mean in terms of orders? Or...

GREGORY P. LEWIS: You're talking about in terms of the
[last] of those orders turning to revenue...

JOSHUA CHARLES POKRZYWINSKI: Yes.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Again, as you know, those things always
have a time frame to them. So they'll probably play out over the back half of
the year.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean when you think about HPS
orders, I mean most of those don't get executed for a course of 18 to 24 months
and sometimes even longer. So there isn't a very fast conversion from orders to
revenue. In some cases, that take -- can take several quarters.

JOSHUA CHARLES POKRZYWINSKI: Got it. And then just shifting
over to some of your short-cycle comments. I think they lined up with what you
said last quarter, Darius. But thinking about some of the intersegment
comments, it seems like SPS, there is good momentum, maybe more of a destock,
so things can improve from there. HBT has a good amount of momentum. You
mentioned in the second half, product launches that could augment that further.
I guess where specifically do you see that lack of short-cycle visibility or
particular apprehension because it looks like in a lot of the exposures,
there's reasons to be maybe a bit more optimistic, not more cautious.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, maybe. I mean I don't know that I
wouldn't necessarily argue with you. But -- actually, on the short cycle, when
you get into beyond 3 months, which is really kind of what we're talking about
for the second half, I think we're pretty confident in our Q2. I'm not that
confident that I really can give you great visibility on short cycle beyond 3
months. I mean there is nothing that I'm seeing that worries me. I mean you
shouldn't read into that, that there is some issue that we're trying to cover
or protect ourselves. I think it's just a reflection of there's a lot of
unknowns. And as I've stated before on this call, we're seeing some of the
commentary by some of our competitors. Some of them had even reported, and we
were wondering are we unique or is there something else that's going on in the
market here that maybe hasn't hit us yet. But I don't see that. I think we're
very bullish on what's happening. But again, it's just a reflection of a level
of uncertainty because I know from my past, the short cycle can turn
extraordinarily quickly, and one quarter can actually be a long time.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes. Again, I just would say on the
macros, I think we all would agree that a Brexit, a hard Brexit is going to
have some impact. And yes, we had anticipated that, that might happen at the
end of March as did the rest of the world, and now that's moved to potentially
October. So that's just now pushed that worry down 6 months into the year. And
again, I'm just saying -- I mentioned it earlier, about stable rattling between
the EU and the U.S. on tariffs and the lack of a done deal with the U.S. and
China just keeps the cloud hanging over to see what's going to happen. So to
Darius' point, it's not that we see something very specific that we know is
coming, but there hasn't been this many macro uncertainties in the environment,
certainly that I can recall.

OPERATOR: Our final question comes from John Walsh with
CrÃ©dit Suisse.

JOHN FRED WALSH, DIRECTOR, CRÃ©DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Just one question around price. It looks like in the Q, and this
could be some rounding, you're still in that 2% ZIP code. I might have thought
that would have ticked up a little bit, maybe it's rounding. But can you just
talk about your ability to capture price? And obviously, I know within the
context of tariffs and Brexit, there are other mitigating actions in there
besides price. But maybe if we could just kind of isolate on price for a little
bit.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Well, again, I would say we feel very good
about our pricing program. And we've talked about it before that particularly
given the value our offerings generate, we feel like we're in a good position
from a price standpoint. As you mentioned, tariff impacts, we've been able to
mitigate, and some of that is through passing them through in pricing, which,
by the way, keep in mind that's dilutive to our margin expansion. You
pass-through $1 of price and have $1 of inflation, that actually dilutes your margin
rate. So I wouldn't say that there is anything concerning at all as we sit here
about our effectiveness in passing through price at this stage.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: And I would just add that, to us,
pricing is a function of really NPD and bringing valuable things to customers.
So we don't really like to talk about price as much as we would like to talk
about value. And I think what you should expect is as our NPD cycle shortens,
which we're launching a whole new innovation process called Z21, which basically
will reduce our innovation cycle time in half. And our -- and the ratio of our
revenues coming from new products will increase, that has obviously greater
opportunities for value capture. So that's really sort of related to your
question. And that innovation cycle is accelerating and it will do so, not just
this year, but for many years to come.

OPERATOR: And that concludes today's question-and-answer
session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr.
Darius Adamczyk for any additional closing remarks.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Honeywell started 2019 with significant
momentum, including strong organic sales and superb earnings and cash flow
growth. We continue to execute well and still have significant balance sheet
capacity to deploy. We're focused on continuing to outperform for our
customers, our shareowners and our employees. I look forward to speaking with
you in May. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. This does conclude today's
teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful
day.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
Honeywell's Fourth Quarter Earnings and 2019 Outlook Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

I would now like to introduce you to your host for today's
conference, Mark Macaluso, please go ahead, Vice President of Investor
Relations.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank
you, Marguerite. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Fourth Quarter 2018
Earnings and 2019 Outlook Call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Darius
Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis.

This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP
reconciliations, are available on our website at 

.

Note that elements of this presentation contain
forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of
our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we ask that
you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and
uncertainties that affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and
other SEC filings.

For this call, references to adjusted earnings per share,
adjusted free cash flow and free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate
exclude the impact from separation costs related to the 2 spin-offs of our
Homes and Transportation Systems businesses as well as pension mark-to-market
adjustments and U.S. tax legislation, except where otherwise noted in 2018.
With regards to 2019, references to adjusted free cash flow guidance and
associated conversion on this call exclude impacts from separation cost
payments related to the spin-off.

This morning, we will review our financial results for the
fourth quarter and full year 2018, share our guidance for the first quarter of
2019 and discuss our full year outlook. As always, we will leave time for your
questions on the end.

With that, I will turn the call over to Chairman and CEO,
Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, CEO &
PRESIDENT, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning,
everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. We're extremely pleased with our results in
2018. We made progress both from a portfolio and financial perspective,
continued smart investments in our businesses and our people and took steps to
position the company for the next 20 years.

This quarter, we successfully completed our second spin-off
of the year, Residio Technologies, launching our new stock exchange in October.
We also continued to advance our software strategy while growing our quote
businesses in attractive end markets. And most importantly, consistent with
what we've done all year, Honeywell delivered on its commitments to our
shareowners. We met or exceeded our financial commitments on all metrics,
delivering adjusted earnings per share of $1.91 in the fourth quarter, driven
by 6% organic sales growth and 80 basis points of segment margin expansion.

We continue to see strength in our long-cycle businesses,
most notably in Commercial Aerospace, Defense and Warehouse Automation, where
our Intelligrated business is a global leader. Furthermore, we are aggressively
planning and mitigating the impacts of the tariffs dispute in all of our
businesses, as evidenced by the strong margin expansion we generated this
quarter. Based on what we know of today, we do not expect any material impact
to our results in 2019 related to tariffs.

For the full year, we achieved 100% free cash flow
conversion and 105% conversion in the fourth quarter. We generated over $6
billion of free cash flow for the year, excluding spin cost payments, up 22%
even after spinning nearly 20% of the company in the fourth quarter. This was
principally driven by profitable growth, higher net income and continued efforts
to free up working capital, all the while funding smart growth investments
through $800 million of CapEx.

Our free cash flow as a percent of sales was the highest
it's been in at least 15 years, and we expect it will continue to grow from
here. Importantly, our U.S. pension is funded at over 105%, and we do not
expect any cash contributions in the near term. The financial health of this
company heading into 2019 is as strong as it's ever been, and we still have
ample resources to deploy.

Lastly, we continued a steady cadence of capital deployment
for an additional $1.7 billion of Honeywell share repurchases in the quarter,
bringing the full year total to approximately $4 billion. As a result, and now
expect the fully diluted share count to be down at least 3% in 2019 based on
our plan to reduce share count by at least 1% from 2018.

As we continue to return cash to our shareowners through
$2.3 billion in dividend, following another double-digit dividend increase in
2018. This was a particularly good year for Honeywell. We have a simpler, more
focused portfolio after the spins and continue to execute on our initiatives as
we look to the future. We see strength across several end markets and have
significant balance sheet capacity to deploy. And while we're not planning for
a recession in 2019, we are taking steps now to ensure we deliver on our
commitment in an uncertain economic environment.

Let's turn to Slide 3 to review some of the progress from
last year. As I mentioned, we took significant steps through 2018 to transform
the business. One of my key priorities from the outset was to accelerate
organic growth. As you've seen by our results, we're making good progress on
this front. We're encouraged by the fact that nearly 60% of the portfolio grew
sales 5% or more organically for the full year of 2018 with several businesses
growing above 10%.

With the spin-offs complete, we now operate a more focused
portfolio in a smaller number of attractive end markets. Portfolio optimization
is central to and will continue to be part of Honeywell's operating system. We
plan to continue effectively deploying capital by funding high-return CapEx and
returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

We have had 9 consecutive double-digit dividend increases
since 2010 and still have a strong and flexible balance sheet with the ability
to deploy over $14 billion of cash through M&A, CapEx, dividends and share
repurchases. A combination of strong sales growth, favorable end-market
exposure and significant balance sheet capacity positions us well as we head
into 2019.

We are now on Slide 4. As I mentioned, continuous
transformation is part of Honeywell's operating system. On this slide, we
highlight 3 key transformation initiatives to establish Honeywell as a premier
technology company for the future. Earlier this year, we established Honeywell
Connected Enterprise, or HCE, which is a strengthened and centralized
organization that will serve as a software innovation engine for all of
Honeywell. HCE operates with the speed and agility of a start-up, working close
with our businesses and our customers across the entire portfolio to build the
world's best software solutions rapidly and efficiently on a single platform.

Our transformation to a premier technology company required
us to look beyond just spin-offs. Our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Torsten Pilz,
is leading Honeywell's efforts to improve our supply chain and optimize our
global footprint. We see a lot of opportunity here to drive margin expansion
and operational efficiency, and you'll hear much more about this from Torsten
at our Annual Investor Conference in May.

We are making similar enhancements on our capabilities
internally with Honeywell's digital initiative. This requires people, process,
data and technology elements to come together, which will allow for more
effective and efficient decision-making throughout Honeywell. This effort
includes a continuation of our progress through centralized ERP systems.

Thus far, we have eliminated 35 unique systems in 2018,
going from 106 to 71, and we are on path to just 10 ERP applications by the end
of 2020. The result will be consistent processes and centralized data
governance of a common IT foundation.

As you can see, we have achieved a lot this year and
continue to redefine the limits on what Honeywell can achieve to be the best
positioned, multi-industrial company for the future.

Let's turn to Slide 5 to briefly review progress against our
key priorities.

I laid out my key priorities for the company in 2017. Since
then, we've continued to foster a culture within Honeywell of doing what we say
or, as we call it, the say-do ratio. As you stack the results against our
long-term commitments, you can see we're clearly making progress and, in some
instances, achieving milestones sooner than we thought, such as with our
organic sales growth and free cash flow conversion. We are accomplishing these
objectives while making smart investments for the future through CapEx,
restructuring and research and development.

Our software businesses grew in the mid-teens range last
year on a path to the 20% long-term compound annual growth rate we anticipate.
We've taken steps to unify and strengthen our software strategy through the
Honeywell Connected Enterprise and continue to invest in software development,
sales and marketing capabilities and buildout of the Sentience platform.

In 2018, Honeywell Ventures made 5 investments, including in
Soft Robotics, a developer of automation solutions in soft robotic gripping
systems that can grasp and manipulate items with the same dexterity of the
human hand; and in IoTium, a managed secure network infrastructure platform for
the Industrial Internet of Things that primarily serves building technologies
and industrial customers.

We also completed 2 bolt-on acquisitions totaling roughly
$500 million. Ortloff Engineers is a privately held licensor and
industry-leading developer of specialized technologies that drive high returns
in natural gas processing and sulfur recovery. This complements our existing
UOP offering, which allows us to better meet customer needs for high recovery
non-gas liquid extraction plants globally.

Transnorm, now part of Safety and Productivity Solutions, is
a global leader in high-performance conveyor solutions that are used in diverse
end markets such as parcel delivery, e-commerce fulfillment and airports. The
acquisition strengthens Honeywell's warehouse automation portfolio and
positions the company to support the growing European e-commerce market while
broadening Honeywell's connected distribution center and aftermarket offerings.

I'll stop there and turn the call over to Greg, who will
discuss our fourth quarter results and 2019 outlook in more detail.

GREGORY P. LEWIS, SENIOR VP & CFO, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL
INC.: Thanks, Darius, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Slide 6. As
Darius mentioned, we finished 2018 very strong in every financial metric.
Organic sales growth for the fourth quarter was 6%. We have been at or above 5%
every quarter this year. This reflects our continued commitment to customer
excellence, new product development as well as our realization of benefits from
the investments we've made in our sales organization and new product
development process.

We generated approximately $2 billion of segment profit in
the fourth quarter, driven principally by higher sales volumes with segment
margin expansion of 80 basis points. The impact from the spin-offs of
lower-margin businesses, net of acquisitions, contributed 30 basis points,
while the core business generated 50 basis points expansion. Pricing and
productivity was strong, which enabled us to effectively mitigate the impact of
material and labor inflation. We also saw continued benefits from previously
funded restructuring.

Adjusted EPS was $1.91, up 12% versus prior year, excluding
the spins, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.01. The
adjusted EPS figure excludes both the impact of an approximate $435 million
favorable adjustment to the 4Q '17 tax charge and $104 million in spin-related
separation costs.

At the outlook call in 2018, we estimated that separation
costs for the 2 transactions would be in the range of $800 million to $1.2
billion. I'm very pleased to report that the total separation costs for both
spins came in lower than this estimate at $730 million, which demonstrates our
ability to effectively execute complex transactions, both ahead of schedule and
below budget.

We also recorded $300 million in repositioning charges in
the quarter to fund future productivity and stranded cost reductions. Share
buybacks totaled $4 billion in 2018 and drove a $0.06 benefit from lower share
count in the quarter. You can find a bridge to the fourth quarter adjusted
earnings per share in the appendix of this presentation.

Finally, working capital improved 0.6 turns year-over-year.
Our businesses are all focused on improving working capital, and we continue to
see progress on our initiatives, with room to free up more cash for capital
deployment.

Now I'll turn to Slide 7 and review our segment results. Our
Aerospace business continued to perform extremely well in a robust demand
environment, capping off a strong year of near double-digit organic sales
growth. In the fourth quarter, we generated 17% organic growth in Defense &
Space with double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international businesses,
led by global demand for sensors and guidance systems, original equipment
shipment volumes and higher spares volumes on U.S. Department of Defense
programs. We also saw growth in our space business, driven by new satellite
program wins and commercial helicopters, driven by repair and overhaul demand.

In Commercial OE, sales were up 8% organically with
increased HTS engine demand for Gulfstream and Textron Longitude platforms and
higher aviation shipset volumes, driven primarily by the certification of the
Gulfstream G600. Aftermarket growth was strong in all businesses, including
Defense, driven by increased demand for avionics upgrades, both software and
hardware, navigation products and safety mandates. Our Connected Aircraft
offering has continued to gain traction, driven by GoDirect Cabin tail capture
and robust JetWave demand.

Turning to Honeywell Building Technologies. Organic sales
growth was 1%, driven by continued demand for commercial fire products in North
America, Europe and our High Growth Regions. Building Solutions projects growth
was also strong, particularly for international airports. The HPS projects
backlog is up 15%, setting up a strong 2019 as we continue to expand in
critical infrastructure markets like airports, cities and stadiums.

These gains were offset by declines in our China air and
water business and temporary supply chain challenges within our building
management systems business. We expect the air and water business to recover in
2019, driven by new product introductions for the mid-segment and stronger
demand as inventory net levels normalize after a challenging 2018. In December,
the supply chain issues within building management systems began to stabilize,
and we expect continued improvement in the first half of 2019.

HBT also benefited from 1 month of single-digit organic
sales growth from the former Homes business, driven by strength in both
products and ADI Global Distribution. As a reminder, the results for HBT
exclude Homes and Distribution after October.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were flat
on an organic basis. Sales in UOP were up 2%, driven by ongoing strength in
licensing and engineering sales, but were offset by an expected decline in gas
processing, which was driven by an extremely strong fourth quarter in 2017.

Process solutions sales were up 1% organically, driven
primarily by a strong demand in our software maintenance and migration services
and steel devices. This was offset by declines in large project activity and in
smart energy and thermal solutions, both shorter-cycle businesses, due to
supply chain challenges. Notably, we continue to see solid trends within the
automation businesses of Process Solutions, with total orders up double digits
and short-cycle backlog up over 30%, suggesting that oil price volatility in
the fourth quarter may have temporarily delayed customer investment decisions.

Advanced Materials sales were down 3% on an organic basis as
continued strong demand and adoption of our Solstice line of low global-warming
refrigerants, which was up 5%, was offset by declines in specialty products,
particularly in our electronic materials business, which is in the
semiconductor space, as you know, and tough comps associated to the fourth
quarter of 2017.

PMT segment margins expanded 200 basis points in the fourth
quarter, as expected, driven by the timing of catalyst shipments within UOP,
commercial excellence and the benefits from previously funded repositioning.

Now turning to the Safety and Productivity Solutions
business. That continued to perform at a high level with organic sales up 15%,
driven by broad-based strength across all lines of business. Double-digit
organic growth in Intelligrated continued as orders for major systems and
robust backlog conversion fueled by e-commerce drove strong results.

We also saw double-digit growth in our sensing business and
continued strength in our productivity products business, driven by demand for
Android-based mobility offerings and handheld printing devices. In total,
organic growth in our productivity solutions segment was up 23%.

Moving to safety. The safety business sales grew 5%
organically, led by ongoing demand for gas products and strong growth in retail
footwear associated with the holiday season.

Finally, we continue to see strength in our businesses
across High Growth Regions. In China, SPS grew double digits with robust growth
across industrial safety, productivity products and SIoT. Excluding the ongoing
softness in air and water, HBT also grew double digits in China. For all of
Honeywell, China was up 9% organically for the full year.

In India, our capabilities and strength provided exceptional
growth in the fourth quarter, greater than 25% over prior year. This was driven
by our building and process solutions businesses. We continue to see positive
macroeconomic trends in the Middle East with supported growth across all
businesses, with 3 segments growing double digits organically compared to the
prior quarter.

Now with 2018 in the rearview mirror, let's move to Slide 8
and discuss our 2019 outlook.

We have a reliable playbook at Honeywell, and it's not
changing for 2019. Our focus on smart growth investments, breakthrough
initiatives and new product development, coupled with productivity rigor and
the benefits of funded repositioning, has positioned us well for continued
outperformance.

For 2019, we anticipate an organic sales growth range of 2%
to 5%, the low end of which reflects the possibility of some economic slowing,
but not a recession in 2019. Segment margin expansion is expected to be 110 to
140 basis points or 30 to 60 basis points, excluding the impact of the
spin-offs. This will drive earnings per share growth of 6% to 10%, excluding
dilution from the spins in 2018. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow
conversion near 100%, consistent with 2018, driven by high-quality income
growth and continued working capital improvements across the portfolio.

We're confident in our businesses and the year ahead
supported by positive long-cycle orders and backlog trends exiting 2018. We
have put forth a strong plan with multiple cost levers to pull in the event the
recent volatility in the macro environment persists. As Darius mentioned in his
opening, we don't expect a significant impact in 2019 related to tariffs. We
have worked very hard to mitigate that across the year for 2019, including
addressing the potential impact of the still-unannounced List 4, which
contemplates a 25% tariff on all remaining items imported from China. We will
continue to monitor this throughout the year and react accordingly as we did in
2018.

Some other items to take note of related to our 2019 plan.
We are on track to slightly ahead of our plan to eliminate all stranded costs
in 2019 related to the spin-offs, with a little over half the costs removed to
date. We see the impact of these costs primarily in the net corporate cost line
and in the segment margin in Honeywell building technologies. Also, based on the
planned reduction in pension income driven by discount rates and assumed asset
returns as well as lower repositioning and other charges driven by the spin
indemnity, our total net below-the-line charges are expected to be
approximately $80 million in 2019.

We will see continued benefits from planned and executed
share repurchases. Our 2019 plan assumes a weighted average share count
reduction of about 3% year-on-year or 730 million shares. This is based on the
2% share count reduction we executed from 2018 repurchases and at least 1%
additional reduction in 2019. You'll find additional details on our 2019
planned inputs in the appendix.

Based on what we can see today, we expect to be at the upper
end of our sales guidance range for organic growth. However, given the many
uncertainties in the macro signals, we're planning cautiously in 2019 overall
as it's difficult to predict short-cycle revenues, particularly in the second
half of the year. And remember that is still approximately 60% of our business.

Let's turn to Page 9. We provided an initial assessment of
our end markets and anticipated organic growth rates in each for 2019. The
green arrows are an indication that we expect market conditions to improve
while the gray flat arrows indicate that we expect market conditions to remain
relatively similar to last year.

Starting with aerospace, we expect organic sales to be up
strong mid-single digits for the year. We continue to see a robust demand
environment in both commercial aerospace and defense. In air transport, we
expect continued growth in narrowbody production rates. We forecast new
business jet deliveries to increase 8% to 10% in 2019, supported by several new
aircraft models entering into service, a decline in young, used aircraft
inventories and stable used jet prices.

Our long-term strategy of securing good positions on the
right platforms, and building our installed base will serve us well in 2019,
particularly with new business jet platforms, where we are well positioned from
an OE standpoint.

Mid-single-digit flight hours growth will continue to drive
aftermarket demand, and we expect further tailwind from the ADS-B compliance
mandate deadline, along with increased demand for Connected Aircraft solutions
across all products. The industry dynamics in defense will be positive in the
U.S. and internationally, driven by budget growth, but we are planning
conservatively for 2019 given the tough year-over-year comparisons, following
2018's banner year, where we grew 15% organically in the business.

With the favorable margin rate uplift from the former
transportation systems spin, you should expect segment margins of approximately
24% for the aero business going forward.

Now on to HBT. As a reminder, following the spin of our
Homes portfolio, HBT's primary exposure is to nonresidential construction.
Here, we anticipate low single-digit organic sales growth after a challenging
2018, driven by better execution of our operations, better selling strategies
and sales coverage and new product introductions. We expect commercial fire
will continue to be strong with the expansion of sales coverage and share gain
and commercial security to improve with the expansion of our channel partner
network.

The declines we experienced in our China-based air and water
business should subside through a combination of stronger market demand and new
product introductions for the mid-segment and mass mid-segment. Globally, we
see building management solutions growth in both hardware and software, driven
by High Growth Regions expansion and our investments in software.

Honeywell Building Solutions growth will be driven by
government investments in smart cities, social infrastructure and airport
modernization and capacity enhancements, particularly in High Growth Regions.
We also expect continued adoption of Connected Building solutions on a global
basis. You should expect to see margins in the range of about 20.5% in HBT
after the spin-off of Homes.

For PMT, sales are expected to be up low single digits plus
on an organic basis. In oil and gas, petrochemical market growth should remain
steady at about 4%, driven by demand for packaging and plastics. However, given
the volatility in oil prices in the second half of 2018, investments in global
megaprojects slowed, and we see the oil price volatility potentially putting
some pressure on upstream spending plans in 2019. Nevertheless, we anticipate
similar market dynamics overall for 2018. And the basis for our plan is that
oil prices remain in the low to mid-s$60 per barrel.

The refining market should continue to be strong as global
demand for cleaner transportation fuels remains. The U.S. natural gas market,
which is primarily served by our UOP Russell business, is expected to improve
from 2018. UOP is expected to deliver a strong year driven by a strong backlog,
licensing and services growth and improved market demand in gas processing
after a tough 2018. Process Solutions will continue to grow across its
short-cycle businesses, as we saw in 2018. This is supported by short-cycle
backlog, which was up over 30% at the year-end.

Finally, within Advanced Materials, we expect continued
growth from Solstice and our Fluorine Products business and better execution in
specialty products.

Lastly, in SPS, sales are expected to be up in the mid-single-digit
range. We expect the strong e-commerce and warehouse distribution macro trend
to continue as our customers seek and implement differentiated warehouse
solutions to deal with rising demand. Our orders in Intelligrated in 2018 were
up over 30% for the year.

In the safety business, we anticipate growth will be driven
by new product introductions within Gas Detection, growth in our core product
lines and high-risk personal protective equipment and new product launches in
general safety.

In productivity, we expect strong growth driven by backlog
conversion in Intelligrated and our sensing business, new mobility product
introductions and expanded software offerings. We're also seeing growth in our
life cycle service offerings in Intelligrated, which includes maintenance,
technical support and optimization services. That is combined with the
aftermarket capabilities we acquired with Transnorm.

Now let's move on to Slide 10. Here you can see the bridge
of our 2018 adjusted earnings per share to 2019. The spin impact, which we
define as the after-tax segment profit contribution from the spins in 2018, 9
months of transportation systems and 10 months of Homes, net of the estimated
impact of the spin indemnity, assuming that it was in place all year for 2018,
will be a $0.62 headwind to earnings in 2019.

As you can see, the majority of our earnings improvement,
$0.30 to $0.60 per share, will again come from operational gains in our
businesses, driven by profitable growth, continued productivity improvements
and incremental benefits from previously funded restructuring. You can see the
remaining impacts from the share count, below-the-line items and tax rate I
have already touched on will contribute approximately $0.11 per share.

Now let's move to Slide 11 to discuss our first quarter
guidance. For the first quarter, we expect to generate 3% to 5% organic sales
growth, driven principally by healthy growth in our long-cycle businesses, with
a more cautious tone towards short cycle, given the market volatility exiting 2018.
With that said, we do anticipate that the commercial aftermarket, our sensing
business and productivity products and commercial fire products will continue
to be strong on the short-cycle side.

We expect segment margins will expand 30 to 60 basis points
ex the spins, consistent with our long-term framework, and 110 to 140 basis
points on a reported basis, aided by 80 basis points of margin accretion from
the absence of the 2 spins. Our expected adjusted earnings per share range of
$1.80 to $1.85 represents growth of 6% to 9% ex spins.

We have $0.25 of earnings dilution from the spins in the
first quarter of 2018. Our guide is based on an effective tax rate of 22% and a
weighted average share count of 737 million shares for the quarter. We feel
this will be a very strong start to another successful year for Honeywell in
2019.

With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Darius, who
will wrap up on Slide 12.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Thanks, Greg. We accomplished a lot in
2018 and expect great things in 2019 as well. We delivered on all our
commitments, successfully completed spin-offs ahead of schedule and under
budget, while still overdriving on the organic growth, margin expansion,
earnings per share and free cash flow targets that we established at the end of
2017.

There's significant room for continued margin expansion on
the path to our long-term target of 23%. This is aided by over $450 million of
repositioned fund in 2018, and in prior years, which will drive improvements to
our cost structure, supply chain and gross margin in 2019 and beyond.

Our balance sheet capacity is strong, and this will provide
another lever to drive outperformance in any macro environment. We're
continuing the business transformation through several new initiatives,
including Honeywell digital, a unified software business in Honeywell Connected
Enterprise and the increased focus on our supply chain. We are excited about
2019 and expect another great year.

With that, Mark, let's move on to Q&A.

MARK MACALUSO: Thanks, Darius. Darius and Greg are now
available to answer your questions. (Operator Instructions) Marguerite, if you
could, please open up the line for Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We can now take our first
question from Peter Arment from Baird.

PETER J. ARMENT, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD
& CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Nice way to finish up 2018. Darius,
I guess, on Aerospace, just really the momentum continues to be really
impressive with organic growth of 10% in each of the past 2 quarters. Maybe you
could talk about, I guess, the sustainability or the confidence around the biz
jet volume for you. I know you mentioned 8% to 10% for this year.

And on the 2019 Aerospace guidance of mid-single-digit plus,
is the defense tough comp really the only headwind you're seeing in 2019? Maybe
just some color there.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, so first of all, we're very
confident about our Aero outlook for 2019. Our bookings have been strong.
January has been strong. Yes, the comps do get tougher, and there's some short
cycle.

And I think as people saw in our outlook for Q1 and what I
anticipate will be Q2, we have every bit of confidence that mid-single-digit is
hopefully the bottom. But the fact is we don't know the second half of the
year, and that's why the numbers are what they are. And potential government
shutdowns and budgetary challenges and trade licenses potentially becoming an
issue. We hope that doesn't happen. That just reflects sort of external risks.

But overall, there's absolutely nothing that I'm concerned
about in terms of the bookings, the growth rates, the kind of growth we're
seeing in that business. And it's pervasive across all 3 segments, whether air
transport, BGA or Defense & Space. So I'm very pleased, and it's not a
place where I'm going to be losing a lot of sleep in 2019.

OPERATOR: We can now take our next question from Sheila
Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.

SHEILA KARIN KAHYAOGLU, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Across your 4 business, you either have a deceleration in
organic growth or a flattening of sales growth. Just how -- where are you
factoring in some conservatism with the slowdown? And how are you capturing
that low end of the sales growth guidance of 2%?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think it's not so much that I'm
-- we're capturing any conservatism in any of the businesses. I think what we
have in our guidance going forward is the fact that more than 50% of our
business is short cycle.

What's different about this year than I think many years in
the past is we have many more unknowns, whether it's Brexit, whether it's trade
negotiations, specific China-U. S., whether it's fed hikes in terms of what
happens, whether it's the government shutdowns, there are just a lot of
geopolitical unknowns, more than usual. And for us to express a level of
confidence around all these unknowns, around a little bit wider range than we
anticipated, I think would be -- would probably indicate a level of knowledge
that we currently don't have.

Now having said that, and as you can see in our Q1 outlook,
we're actually front-end-loaded. And if anything, we're going to be at the
upper half of our revenue growth range in the first half of the year. So
actually, we're -- provided all things go as we think they will to the positive
side, I think that, hopefully, we'll be raising the bottom of that range as we
move further through the year. But there's -- I don't see really any growth
issues with any of our businesses, and we expect all of them to grow in 2019.

OPERATOR: We can now take our next question from John Inch
from Gordon Haskett.

JOHN GEORGE INCH, MD & SENIOR ANALYST OF
MULTI-INDUSTRIALS, GORDON HASKETT RESEARCH ADVISORS: So how did your European
businesses do? And what's actually baked, I guess, on the growth rate? Any
color there on what's baked into your guidance for 2019 for Europe?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes, yes. John, Europe continued to be
strong. In the fourth quarter, our European businesses were up 6%, which capped
off a 4% organic growth for the year. So I still think we're seeing good strong
growth there. And it's pretty broad-based, to be honest, SPS probably the
strongest of the bunch, but each of the businesses is growing in the mid-single
digits or higher in Europe at this stage.

And as we look forward, we expect that's probably going to
be still low mid-single digits, low to mid-single digits. But as Darius
mentioned, clearly, there are concerns out there. I mean, Brexit, in
particular, we'll have some sort of an answer in the next 60 days as to what
occurs with that. And we've got a meaningful-sized business in the U.K. So
definitely back to the concern aspects of macro signals. Europe is an area
where we're waiting to see what's going to happen with Brexit in particular and
what impacts that may have on us.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: But Greg, that performance, the 6%, that's
pretty good relative to what other companies have been putting up in Europe.
And given sort of the slowing in Germany and stuff, is there a mix issue that's
benefiting Honeywell or new products? Or what do you think's attributable to
why you're doing -- so just general comment.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Well, again, I would tell you that each --
yes, each of the businesses is performing well. So it's not like one is -- I
mean, SPS being the strongest of the bunch, but each of them is up mid-single
digits for the year. So it's strength across our entire portfolio.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: And as a follow-up, last year, you guys
put up the 3% to 5% core growth target. And Darius, you flagged accelerating
core growth as your #1 priority. Now I understand the economic sensitivities
around the 2% to 5% this year. But I'm just trying to think big picture.

What are you and how are you actually going to tackle
driving Honeywell toward more of a mid-single-digit type of accelerating core
growth over time? Is that meaning to go after like in, Darius, that pie, the
40%, that's not growing at 5% plus? Or do you kickstart building technologies,
which has been sort of a problem for a little while or more M&A? I mean,
what -- maybe just walk us through a little bit of your own thoughts and maybe
horizon, too.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, John, it's not any one thing.
It's probably all those. I mean, it starts with the portfolio. And we think
that based upon what we've done here, we've got a more growth-oriented and less
cyclical portfolio. That's certainly part of it.

Secondly, which is our tremendous focus on Velocity Product
Development, and we're launching a whole new process called Z21, which
basically is going to reduce our innovation cycle times in half, deploying more
capital to R&D because my strong belief is that part of any growth story
there's got to be a strong innovation engine. And that's something that we're
trying to create.

Continued focus on High Growth Regions, I mean, we're
winning in places like China and India. And even though the back half of the
year China was a little bit slower, we grew nearly double-digit in China this
year. So that continues to be a success story. Our focus on Commercial Excellence
with our sales force is working, where we're getting better productivity out of
our sales force, better performance.

It's never only one thing. We're working all those levers.
And as you can see in the growth rate that we've demonstrated, this is --
granted the markets are pretty good. But certainly, without the self-help that
we've administered over the last couple years, there's no way we would be in
that range, both in 2018 and what we're projecting for 2019.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: Just last. India has been a real success
story. I think you flagged it again. Would you consider putting more resources
or doing M&A in India? In particular, I realize it's much smaller than
China, but it does seem to have gained a lot of traction for Honeywell. I'm just
wondering what you're thinking about it.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, we've. Yes. No, we have a lot of
focus on India. I mean, to give you a perspective for India, our growth in
India in Q4 was 27%. So that's tremendous. We have a big footprint there, not
just from a business perspective. We have our engineering centers there of over
10,000 people.

So we feel very comfortable of our presence there. The
opportunity is now to go after the mass mid-market segment, and that's actually
one of our core initiatives for 2019 and beyond is just not to play in the top
tier, the mid-tier, but actually having a greater level of participation in
mid-market segments. So India is definitely one of the economies which we think
is going to be a great story for us in 2019 and beyond.

OPERATOR: We now take our next question from Gautam Khanna
from Cowen and Company.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY,
LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Great results. Two questions. First, just big picture,
M&A pipeline, what can you say about it? Is it as healthy as it's ever
been? Or anything large that you guys are looking at? Just any commentary on
the nature of the pipeline right now.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I would say large, probably not
because I think that we're still very much focused on bolt-ons and not the mega
deals. So I would say that's the -- that is and will continue to be our focus.
We got a deal done in Q4, which was good. Transnorm was a deal of size, the
kind of size we like, that sort of a $0.5 billion capital one would do that.

But to be honest on my commentary the pipeline continues to
be good. We were working on a deal that recently fell through just because --
although there's been a little bit of a correction in the market, as we saw
particularly in December, that didn't really change the expectations of a lot
of the sellers. So we continue to struggle with valuations and the
expectations, where there's a very pronounced shift up. And it's got to work in
our financial model.

So we've continue to be very active. The pipeline is good,
but I also want to tell you that we're realistic because we're cautious buyers,
and we don't like to overpay. So we have to be certain about what we're buying
and make sure that it generates the right level of returns for our shareowners.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA: Appreciate it. And the second question was
just if there are any supplier constraints you're seeing on the Aerospace side.
I remember last year you had some aftermarket constraints. Are you seeing any
pinch points emerge?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. No, no. The answer to that is yes,
and I would say the -- there are some pinch points on the supply chain
emerging, not just in Aerospace. Those are there and prevalent, particularly in
areas like casting, et cetera. But we see similar challenges in smart energy
and even in some elements of electronic supply chain.

So the pinch points on the supply chain are real. They're
there. We're working through those and hope to resolve those. Frankly speaking,
our results could have been even better had some of those pinch points not been
there.

OPERATOR: We can now take our next question from Julian
Mitchell from Barclays.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe just a first question around SPS. You grew around 10%
plus organically in 2018. Your Slide 9 shows about mid-single-digit growth this
year amidst the sort of accelerating market arrow. So is that guidance based on
anything you're seeing in the short-cycle businesses within SPS or it's simply
about tough comps and the usual macro aspects that you mentioned earlier?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes. Thanks, Julian. I think it's a little
bit of both. I mean, obviously, we continue to be very excited about
Intelligrated and the double-digit growth rates that we achieved this year, and
with a very strong backlog expect that to continue to be strong.

We did -- our retail business, though not large, grew over
20% in 2018. So that's probably going to dampen a bit with some of those comps.
We still feel very positive about productivity products and sensing and IoT
with the new product introductions that they have. But those and the industrial
safety businesses, they are short cycle. So -- and when those things change,
they can change quickly.

And so I think that's where we're trying to be a bit
cautious because we've seen it happen before in terms of the speed at which the
short cycle can turn on us. And so it's not a matter of having seen it so far
and being concerned about anything with our business specifically, but I would
just call it a bit more cautioned with the environment we're in.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Just to add to it, Julian. It's
like Greg said. I mean, a majority of that business is actually short cycle.
Intelligrated's about the only business that isn't short cycle. So based on
what we're seeing now and today and our guide for Q1, there's no warning signs
for us here. Where we're positioned is just the uncertainty, particularly
around the second half of the year.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL: And then my second question around
PMT, any more color you'd like to provide on how you see the cadence of the
large project activity within HPS in terms of the scale of any delays, and also
UOP, how you're gauging the volatility there at the moment?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. No, I like the greater stability.
What we saw in Q4 a little bit was a bit of a pause on the order rates just
around the volatility of oil. But kind of given the right direction movement,
we're much more bullish.

But despite that, I just want to quote you a couple numbers
from Q4 on why I'm bullish on PMT for this year. First of all, our HPS order
rates were up double digit. Second of all, our UOP backlog is up 8%. So I'm
very optimistic around PMT performance for 2019.

Probably the one segment that was pretty soft was in our
Advanced Materials business, the electronics chemicals, which electronics has
been a bit weaker, some of the other companies in that segment announcing. And
we saw that in our electronics chemicals business. So that's probably the only
sort of minus that we saw in Q4. But overall, both the backlog, the order rates
were good.

And to be honest, especially in HPS, our global
megaprojects, front-log and quote, are really strong. We didn't even book a lot
of those orders in Q4, and our orders growth was up double-digit in the
quarter. So I feel pretty good about PMT for 2019.

OPERATOR: We can now take our next question from Steve Tusa
from JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Just wanted to ask about the -- we're not sensitive or anything like
that, the -- you mentioned kind of the next phase of the transformation and
some of the footprint stuff that you're looking into.

Is that something that you'll be able to kind of quantify
more and speak to at this year's Investor Day? Or is that going to remain -- I
don't know what you put at the bottom of the slide, like you're consulting with
people or something like that about what the number's going to be? When will we
kind of hear more about that and how big could that opportunity be?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. We're not putting you in the middle
anymore on the call. You wind up grumpy, Steve. No, the -- look, the -- yes, so
the short answer's yes. On Investor Day, we're going to -- it's obviously going
to be a segment of that presentation. We'll give you a lot more detail.

But I just want to be very clear that the next phase of the
transformation's not just the ISC transformation. That's a very big part of it.
But we kind of talked a little bit about this deck about kind of the 3 legs of
the stool, which are ISC transformation, Honeywell digital and Honeywell
Connected Enterprises. That's sort of the next phase of the evolution of
Honeywell.

And 1 of those 3 is a business, and the next 2 are going to
be ongoing for at least the next 3 to 5 years. So this is going to give us a
lot more tailwinds in terms of margins, cash generation, more efficiency of
working capital, simplifications, better planning, lower capital intensity, a
lot of benefits. So we're going to provide a lot more color on that in -- at
our Investor Day.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Are you going to give something
tangible or will it be kind of like directional arrows? I mean, sometimes, this
stuff can -- it sounds great, but ultimately, it doesn't like filter down to
the bottom line for other companies. Just curious if you're going to like give
something tangible, numbers-wise.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: So Steve, I mean, oftentimes, we get asked
about how long of a runway do we have for margin expansion. And to me, this is continuing
to fill the portfolio of things that keeps that runway alive and well. And so
that's kind of the way I'm thinking about all these things are going to
continue to contribute to our ability to drive that margin expansion well
beyond 2019.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. As you get -- as we kind of get
deeper and deeper into the 20s, which we're very comfortable that we're going
to do, and you look at our framework that we presented in 2017, I talked about
30 to 50 basis point expansion. As you see from our performance as well as our
guide and the top end of the range, it's even greater than that number.

These are the kinds of things that enable us to kind of keep
growing that margin machine is self-help and these internal initiatives. And
the good news is we have plenty of opportunity because we've got a lot of work
to do on the supply chain and Honeywell digital. So I view all of that as not
bad news, but really a tremendous opportunity to continue to drive margins.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: And then one last one. I know you guys
don't want to give specific segment guidance, but maybe can you just talk about
who may be above or below the averages when it comes to margin expansion for
2019 just so people are kind of calibrated?

Sometimes, these segments can move around a little bit, and
people tend to kind of pick what they want to look at as positives or
negatives, think it's good to kind of baseline people. Don't need exact
numbers, but just some directional color around what will be above or below
that kind of margin expansion or whether they'll all be kind of in the middle
there. That'd be helpful.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes. I would expect Aero and HBT to
probably lead the pack in terms of the rate of expansion in '19. But each of
the segments will have a very respectable margin expansion profile. But
clearly, with the rate of growth that we're seeing in Aero and leveraging the
fixed costs that we have there, that's probably got a pretty sizable
opportunity.

And again, HBT, I don't know, with a return to growth and
some new products, we see that as also having a fair amount of opportunity. But
each of the businesses, I think, will expand margins in a meaningful way in
'19.

OPERATOR: We can now take our next question from Jeff
Sprague from Vertical Research.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, VERTICAL
RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: Just a couple things on maybe some of the longer-cycle
outlooks and the like. First, on Intelligrated, obviously, you have great
visibility now on '19 on this backlog, but do you have visibility on things
like front-log bidding, et cetera? Do you expect it to be a fairly active order
year again in 2019 for Intelligrated?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. The short answer's absolutely.
Because -- not only because of the continued strength of activity in North
America, which just continues to be robust, but now with the Transnorm and our
enhanced capability in Europe, both from the beachhead that we've established
by acquiring Transnorm, but also because if you recall, we put a lot of investments
back in the '17 and '18 time frame for R&D capability to have a
metrics-based offering. That's complete now, so we're very capable bidding on
warehouses, et cetera. So we continue to expect another very robust year in our
Intelligrated business.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: And then I was also just wondering
back to this megaprojects question in HPS, you noted your orders were strong
even without some of those kind of hitting the order book. I think a lot of
those projects kind of being underwritten at maybe $50 or $60 oil price, so is
it just -- you think there's just kind of a human reflex here that the
volatility in Q4 caused people to just tap the pause button? Or do you see some
legitimate risks to these things kind of sliding out further?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, yes. I think it's just natural
reaction when you see that kind of volatility, like we saw in Q4, that causes
people to pause. But we're actually seeing very positive movement here in Q1,
so I think that some of those decisions will get made. And we feel confident
that when they do get made, we're going to have some positive outcomes for us.
And even -- and I was encouraged by our bookings in Q4 because despite not
having booked some of those [GMP] jobs, we still had a very robust orders
growth.

OPERATOR: We can now take our next question from Scott Davis
from Melius Research.

SCOTT REED DAVIS, FOUNDING PARTNER, CHAIRMAN, CEO &
RESEARCH ANALYST OF MULTI-INDUSTRY RESEARCH, MELIUS RESEARCH LLC: So much of
the future story of Honeywell seems to relate to software in some way, shape or
form, and I'm a little intrigued by HCE in general. And can you help us
understand how centralized is the software development effort?

And whenever I hear about centralized software development,
I always think about Predix, makes me want to cry. But -- or worse. But how do
you still stay close to the customer and the businesses themselves and still
have this type of a centralized effort and share that you're actually getting a
return on the investment?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. So maybe -- let me just maybe
explain that. When I -- when we say, centralized, that means sort of the
platform, the IT stack that we call Sentience. That's what's centralized that
all of our connected enterprises use.

But then the actual analytics, the solutions that are
provided, those are very much vertically oriented. And the way we approach this
is essentially each of those businesses and customer-focused business, so
whether it's connected aircraft, connected plant, connected buildings, we
developed MV0, MV1, which we call single pane of glass, which has a lot of
value driver solutions for end customers.

And we typically partner with a few key anchor customers to
help us iterate and drive and optimize these solutions. So we're very close to
the end customers. Matter of fact, we develop a lot of these solutions with the
end customers, but we also don't want to drive customization, but rather
standardization.

So don't think about this as something that sits in
corporate at kind of a central level, is insular and doesn't work with end
customers. That's not the case. What we want to do is have end customer
intimacy while driving leverage to the IT stack called Sentience. That's really
the core of the spread.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: And maybe if I could just add to that.
With the leadership from Que, she's applying that customer go-to-market
approach across all of those connected enterprises, such that each one of them
individually isn't having to develop those muscles and skill sets independent.

And while these businesses are still embedded inside of the
4 SBGs, those 4 SBG presidents wouldn't possibly be able to give it the amount
of time and attention that Que will be able to do as the President of HCE. So
centralized really means focused, much more so than corporate.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. That's a very good point because --
yes, because what the gist was -- yes, because, Scott, the way this was
organized before, it still has sort of core reporting into the SBG presidents
and Que, but we gave just a lot more authority and control to Que. Just because
when you're running a $10 billion or $12 billion business, and you have
something that's a fraction of that, it requires a lot of time, attention,
strategy changes, agility. It's tough to manage that.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Right. No, that makes sense, and that's
helpful. And you guys have done a nice job, so it's not -- it just requires, I
think, a little bit of explanation. But just a follow-on question really just
on Intelligrated and some of the assets you bought around it.

Are you close to being at the point where you can go to
market together with some of these products globally? And how long will it
take, I mean, just particularly given how regionalized some of the warehouse
offerings are?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, the short answer, Scott, is now. We
are ready. As a matter of fact, we are quoting globally. And as excited as we
are about the North American market, we anticipate being -- securing some jobs
both in Asia this year as well as Europe. And we're ready. We've invested from
an R&D perspective. The Transnorm acquisition is going to further help, but
you should expect us to get some more momentum here on a global level in 2019
and a lot of those solutions are finished.

OPERATOR: We'll now take our next question from Andrew Obin
from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN, MD, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Just a question on defense, just because it was so strong, can you
give us more visibility into how sustainable some of the developments that you
had in 4Q into the first half? I would imagine F-35 ramp is sustainable. You
mentioned space and defense. I think you mentioned aftermarket. If you could
just walk us through visibility for the next 6 months.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Well, I would tell you, so as you
mentioned, our defense business has been growing mid-teens all 4 quarters of
2018. And as we look out for the next 6 months, the backlog growth there is
also very strong. It's strong double digits, over 20% in Defense & Space.
So for the next 6 months, as you mentioned, I think our visibility is very good
to continued strength in that area.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: And just maybe on China. Could you just
describe more color on specific markets and just your top-down view on Chinese
economy and how do you think it will progress through the year? Just because
you have such a big business there and you've been very knowledgeable.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. As I mentioned, it's -- our China
business has been up nearly double digits, just shy of that for the year. So
another solid growth year. A bit of a slowing in -- I would say in Q4, but
there's some very clear reasons, and we understood that slowing. So we kind of
take it segment by segment. If we think about SPS, it was terrific. It was up
double-digit growth in China. No slowing. Actually, if anything, things are
accelerating. In PMT, we had some tough comps. We understood that and expected
that. And we have some big -- both orders and revenue growth, so we expected
that. Nothing unusual.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: We've doubled the business in UOP in the
last 2 years. So the comps is not as small.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, exactly. So nothing out of the
world of expectation. For HBT, as you know, we've had some challenges with the
air and water segment. And frankly, some of our distributor partners got a
little bit of ahead of themselves, given the robust growth that they saw in
'17, and that's been a bit of a challenge for us all year. But we expect that
to grow again in 2019, so we think that that's going to be behind us. And then
with Aero, we had some, say, collections challenges, which actually limited our
shipments because our backlog was actually better than the revenues would
indicate. So all in all, we're not building in a tremendous year in China, not kind
of the usual Honeywell strong double-digit growth in China, where we think it's
going to be a little bit slow. But all of that is reflected in our guide, and
we expect to grow in China in 2019 for certain. How much that's going to be,
well, we'll see. All in all, I feel pretty good about how the businesses are
positioned.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: And do you guys have a view on the
Chinese economy bottoms in '19?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: So I think that's a million dollar --
it's a bit of a million-dollar-question, Andrew. I think a lot of that depends,
and we might know better answer in the next 30 days, right? I mean, I think
we're all watching carefully what happens on the geopolitical sphere and with
the broader economy. Because as I said, we're very prepared from a tariff
perspective because that's something we can identify and should be able to do
something about. What we don't know, and where we have some questions, which is
what is going to be the overall economic impact both on the economies of China,
the U.S., et cetera? That's -- I think at this juncture, it's rough being a
month into the year. It's tough to call, and we'll see what happens.

OPERATOR: Next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman
Sachs.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE, VP & LEAD MULTI-INDUSTRY ANALYST,
GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So obviously, look, you guys got a
lot accomplished in 2018. Congratulations. I think one of the areas that we
haven't really focused a lot on is that specialty products business. And so
maybe just a broader strategic question there. I think that business is tied to
semis, electronics. How do you think about that business longer term? I know
you got -- you did a lot in 2018. This business seems to be a little bit more
cyclical versus the rest of your portfolio. So maybe some thoughts around that
to start would be great.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, yes, there's some
cyclicality. There's also some stability. I mean, we have our Spectra business
there, which is doing quite well; our Aclar business, which is acyclical; our
electronic materials business, which is more cyclical. So it's a bit of a mixed
bag. Probably, we're, given some of the challenges in the electronic segment,
probably on the lower end of the curve than we are. But I think like anything,
I mean, we're -- we like a lot of those businesses. They perform for us. But as
always, we're -- and as we pointed out during our speaker notes today, we're
always assessing everything. I think some of the big things that we wanted to
do that we didn't think that fit our portfolio we did in 2018. But everything
is always under assessment. We're never done, and we always want to kind of add
and also subtract potentially. So I don't -- there's no specific update to the
SP business. But like I said, we're always assessing, and we're going to do
what's -- we're going to make those adjustments as they fit our portfolio.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE: That's fair, Darius. Is it fair to
think of that business, though, as being mostly semi-CapEx-oriented?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: It's a mixed bag. I mean, there's really
a variety of different businesses, and that's why it's kind of tough to talk
about sort of any given one trends because you have electronic materials, you
have some defense spend. You have health care in there. You have consumer
goods. So I mean, you have an entire variety of end markets that there's
exposure in specialty products. So it's tough to say what that total blend ends
up to, but, yes, there's sort of eclectic mix of various end markets.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE: Okay. Yes, fair enough. And just one
quick one, Greg. You mentioned stranded costs earlier. I think the number I had
was like roughly around like $340 million, $350 million. The -- so the timing
of those costs, I mean, is it what's remaining into -- in 2019? First, can you
quantify what's left in 2019? Secondly, will we get through those costs through
the first half of the year? Or are they going to be kind of linear as the year
progresses?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes. So we've taken actions that will have
eliminated about half of those costs already as we exited 2018. And as you saw
in the fourth quarter, with the corporate number being flat to slightly up,
that reflects the first quarter of not having the ability to allocate about $45
million or $50 million to those 2 spin businesses that are now gone. So that's
a little bit of why you saw maybe a heavier number than you might have
expected. But we expect that to come down over the course of the year from the
first to the fourth quarter. And we will exit the fourth quarter at a run rate
by which all of those costs will be gone. So that's -- you should expect to see
a bit of stair-step down. And again, keep in mind that 2/3 of it is in our net
corporate costs. About 1/3 of it was sitting in HBT. So you're not going to see
a $300 million number per se, but it's reflective of a step-down as we go
through the year.

OPERATOR: Next question comes from Christopher Glynn from
Oppenheimer.

CHRISTOPHER D. GLYNN, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER
& CO. INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Anyways, a question on nonres. A lot of
mixed messages, people talking about low single digits. But yesterday, a peer
talked about very robust commercial projects. So just wondering what you're
seeing in that space. Is that a very vibrant market? Or is it just kind of GDP
limp?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No. I mean, if you look at our HPS
business, which is probably the best indication of kind of the commercial
activity, up double-digit bookings in Q4. So actually very, very strong. That's
good. We also want to make sure we capture the service. That's the opportunity.
That business is stabilizing. I think Vimal and that team have put the business
on the right path. We're seeing good signs. And sort of the secret to the
growth there is revitalization of the NPD pipeline. And I see a lot of good
things in the various segments, whether it's building products, whether it's
fire, whether it's our BMS systems. So we actually expect a pretty good year.
And if you take HPS as a leading indicator, that's also been a pretty good sign
in Q4. So we're a little bit cautious in the outlook, but given the stability
that we have now, and it should be a nice story for us -- a recovery story for
us in 2019.

OPERATOR: And I would now like to turn the call back to
Darius.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Thank you. Our end markets continue to
be strong, and we've got simpler, more focused portfolio following completion
of the spins. We continue to execute well, as evidenced by our sales, margin
and cash performance. We have significant balance sheet capacity to deploy. We
have a strong performance culture. Our say will continue to equal our do, and
we're focused on continuing to outperform for our customers, our shareowners
and our employees. I continue to be encouraged by what I see in each of our
businesses and our people. I'm excited for what I know will be a strong 2019.
Thank you for listening.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
Honeywell's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As
a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's
conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.:
Thanks, Derrick. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Third Quarter 2018
Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Darius
Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis.

This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP
reconciliations, are available on our website at 

.

Note that elements of this presentation contain
forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of
our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we ask that
you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and
uncertainties that affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and
other SEC filings.

For this call, references to adjusted earnings per share,
free cash flow, free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate exclude
impacts from separation costs related to the spin-offs of our Homes and
Transportation Systems businesses and U.S. tax legislation, except where
otherwise noted.

This morning, we'll review our financial results for the
third quarter of 2018, share our guidance for the fourth quarter and provide an
update to our full year 2018 outlook.

As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, CEO &
PRESIDENT, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning,
everyone. This has been a very exciting quarter for Honeywell. In August, we
raised our full year earnings outlook by an additional $0.05, the fourth
increase in 2018, driven by continued momentum throughout the portfolio. We
completed the spin-off of Garrett Motion on October 1 and are in the final
stages of completing our second spin of the Homes and Global Distribution
business, Resideo. We also announced our acquisition of Transnorm, a
Europe-based supplier of warehouse automation solutions, which I'll talk about
more in a minute. Most importantly, we continue to deliver on our commitments
to shareholders.

We met or exceeded our guidance on all metrics. For the
third quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.03, up 17%
year-over-year, driven largely by strong operational performance. We grew
organic sales 7%, with impressive top line growth across Aerospace, Safety and
Productivity Solutions and Homes. And our long-range orders and backlog were up
26% and 17% year-over-year, respectively, which positions us well for continued
growth in 2019 and beyond.

Our focus on maintaining our productivity rigor, especially
in an inflationary environment, was relentless this quarter. We generated 70
basis points of segment margin expansion, 20 basis points above the high end of
our guidance, driven by sales excellence and strong productivity gains enabled
by previously funded and an executed restructuring. We'll talk more about the
steps we've taken to address the impact of tariffs later in the call.

We also continue to see improvements in working capital
performance, coupled with profitable growth, which is driving increased free cash
flow conversion. This quarter, we generated $1.8 billion of adjusted free cash
flow, up 51% year-over-year, excluding separation costs. Conversion this
quarter was 119%, well above our long-term target.

I'm particularly pleased with the progress we've seen, and
I'm confident there's more to come as we enhance our capabilities through the
deployment of HOS Gold. We are focused on improving working capital management
at every level of the organization.

Lastly, as we've done throughout the year, we continued to
execute our aggressive and disciplined capital deployment strategy, committing
more than $4.5 billion to share repurchases, dividends and acquisitions through
the third quarter. That number includes the dividend paid to date, the
Transnorm acquisition and approximately $600 million in share repurchase in the
third quarter. The pullback in the stock in the first half of October allowed
for additional repurchases of Honeywell shares into the fourth quarter at
attractive levels. And as you saw, we increased our dividend by 10% in
September, which is the ninth double-digit increase since 2010.

Our end markets continue to be strong, and we have a
simpler, more focused portfolio following completion of the spins. As I said
last quarter, we continue to execute well as evidenced by our sales, margin and
cash performance, and we have significant balance sheet capacity to deploy. I
continue to be encouraged by what I see in each of our businesses, and I'm
excited for what I know will be a strong finish to 2018.

Let's turn to Slide 3 to highlight some of the recent
exciting news in our businesses. In Aerospace, Gulf Air selected Honeywell's
GoDirect Flight Efficiency software to reduce fuel cost and to lower emissions
across its entire 32-aircraft fleet. This software provide Gulf Air a clear
analysis and realtime insights that address all flight variables, allowing them
to unlock savings beyond standard efficiency initiatives. Gulf Air joins a
growing list of airlines adopting GoDirect Flight Efficiency software, including
Aer Lingus, British Airways, Etihad Airways, KLM, Lufthansa and Turkish
Airlines.

In Home and Building Technologies, Honeywell partnered with
Dubai Properties to complete the installment of energy savings upgrade in all
11 Business Bay Executive Towers in Dubai. The project includes a fully digital
building management system to monitor and control the tower's mechanical and
electrical utilities as well as fan coil units that integrate the software to
provide visibility into electricity consumption. We anticipate the project will
result in savings of 3.3 million-kilowatt hours or approximately $400,000
annually.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, Jizzakh Petroleum
selected Honeywell UOP technologies for new refinery capable of processing 5 million
tons of crude oil per year. UOP will provide licensing and basic engineering
design services that allow Jizzakh Petroleum to convert crude oil into
high-quality, clean-burning Euro V motor fuels. This is the 20th award for
UOP's diesel hydrotreating technology and the 33rd award for its gasoline
Unicracking technology in the last 10 years.

Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of
Transnorm, a privately held European warehouse automation solutions provider
that specializes in curve conveyor systems that quickly and efficiently move
products and packages for premier e-commerce and parcel delivery customers.
Transnorm has an installed base of 160,000 units and a large and growing
aftermarket parts and services business. The addition of Transnorm broadens
Honeywell's Intelligrated product portfolio and allows SPS to participate in a
fast-growing European warehouse automation market, fueled by growth in
e-commerce. Clearly, a lot of exciting things are happening across the
portfolio as we head into the final quarter of the year.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Greg, who will
discuss our third quarter results in more detail.

GREGORY P. LEWIS, SENIOR VP & CFO, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thanks, Darius, and good morning, everyone.

I'm going to begin on Slide 4. As Darius mentioned, we
delivered another strong quarter. Consistent with the first half, organic
growth was broad across the portfolio, with about 65% of our portfolio growing
5% or more in the quarter and over 3/4 of the organic growth coming from
increased volumes.

A few highlights. Commercial Aviation OE grew 19%
organically led by business aviation. Defense & Space grew 14% organically,
with double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international businesses. And
Safety and Productivity Solutions grew 12% organically, led by Intelligrated
warehouse automation business.

The markets we serve continue to be strong, and we continue
to leverage our leading market positions, new product launches and investments
in Commercial Excellence to drive profitable growth. We generated 70 basis
points of margin expansion in the quarter, while continuing our investments for
growth and effectively managing the impact of inflation.

A big part of our performance was driven by productivity,
enabled by our ongoing restructuring activities. This quarter, we funded
approximately $70 million in new restructuring projects, aimed at improving our
cost structure and optimizing our footprint and supply chain.

The majority of our earnings growth, $0.20 this quarter,
came from segment profit improvement, driven by enhanced sales volumes and
sales excellence across the company. We also realized a $0.05 benefit from
share repurchases, which resulted in a lower weighted average share count of
752 million shares. This year through the third quarter, we've reduced the
outstanding share count by more than 2% and have deployed more than $2 billion
in share repurchases. Below-the-line items were roughly flat for the quarter
with higher pension income offsetting higher repositioning and other funding.

Finally, our effective tax rate of 21.9% was lower
year-over-year, which generated a $0.04 benefit, consistent with the outlook we
provided at the beginning of the quarter. All told, we delivered adjusted EPS
of $2.03. This figure excludes the net impact of an approximate $1 billion
favorable adjustment to the 4Q '17 tax charge and approximately $233 million in
spin-related separation cost in the quarter. Those include $117 million of tax
cost incurred in the restructuring of our various legal entities in preparation
for the spin-offs. You'll find a bridge to 3Q '18 adjusted earnings per share
in the appendix of the presentation posted on our website.

Finally, we generated adjusted free cash flow in the third
quarter of $1.8 billion, up 51% versus prior year. We continue to see marked
improvements in this area, with stronger cash flows and better conversion
enabled by a 0.6 turn improvement in working capital versus the prior year.
This strong cash generation was most prominent in Performance Materials and
Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. So overall, another strong
performance across the board, consistent with our prior quarters.

I'm now on Slide 5 to review our segment results. The growth
we saw on Aerospace last quarter continued, as we benefited our strong
positions on winning platforms and a robust demand environment. We delivered
sales growth of 10% on an organic basis. Commercial OE sales were up 19%
organically led by engines, avionics and Auxiliary Power Unit demand in
Business & General Aviation; air transport deliveries on the Boeing 737 and
Airbus A350; and lower customer incentives, which added roughly 1 point of
organic growth to Aerospace in total for the quarter.

Defense & Space grew 14% organically, driven by U.S. DoD
spares volume, robust sensors and guidance systems demand and higher volumes on
key programs, including the F-35 and CH-47 Chinook. The Aerospace aftermarket
grew 6% organically, primarily driven by strong airline demand and maintenance
service program activity in business aviation.

As a reminder, this was the last quarter that Transportation
Systems, now publicly traded company called Garrett Motion, contributed to our
Aerospace business. And TS sales were up 7% organically in the quarter on
continued growth in light vehicle gas turbos in North America and Europe,
driven primarily by new launches.

Aerospace segment margins expanded 80 points -- 80 basis
points driven by higher defense and aftermarket volumes, Commercial Excellence
and lower year-over-year customer incentives.

In Home and Building Technologies, organic sales growth was
3% for the quarter. Homes grew 5%, driven by continued strength in ADI Global
Distribution and residential thermal solutions growth in the Americas and Europe.
Buildings grew organically 1%, driven by continued commercial fire product
strength globally, demand for our Tridium building management platform and the
Connected Buildings business, offset by declines in our air and water business
due to low demand for air purifying solutions in China. HBT segment margins
expanded 10 basis points, driven by Commercial Excellence and material and
labor productivity, including benefits from previously funded and executed
restructuring. This was largely offset by the impact of inflation and
unfavorable mix.

HBT did experience some short-term supply chain challenges
and transition impacts related to the Resideo spin-off in the quarter. As you
know, the Homes business was not a separate entity within HBT before the spin.
And the separation, as expected, was complex with some significant changes in
our organization, our systems and our manufacturing footprint. With the Resideo
spin-off slated for October 29, we anticipate that we'll be able to address
most of these challenges within the fourth quarter and get off to a good start
in 2019.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were up 4%
on an organic basis, driven primarily by growth in Advanced Materials and
Process Solutions. Organic sales growth in Advanced Materials of 6% was driven
by significant demand for Solstice low global warming products. Process
Solutions sales were up 4% organically, driven by continued demand in our
short-cycle businesses, principally in software, field devices and maintenance
and migration services.

UOP sales were up 3% organically, driven primarily by growth
in engineering and new catalyst units in China. PMT segment margins contracted,
as we previewed, driven by unfavorable mix in UOP, and we continue to expect
that to turnaround in 4Q as we had previously communicated.

Finally, Safety and Productivity Solutions delivered another
outstanding quarter, with organic sales up 12%, driven by broad-based growth
across all lines of business. Intelligrated continues to outperform, growing consistently
at double digits, driven by strong orders growth in major systems and a robust
backlog of new wins fueled by growth in e-commerce.

We saw continued demand for new Android-based mobility
product offerings as well as for service and scanning applications in the
quarter. We also saw double-digit growth in our legacy sensing business. All in
all, organic sales growth was 16% in our Productivity Solutions businesses.

Within the Safety business, organic growth was 6%, with
strong demand for new gas and general Safety Products. Additionally, the SPS
China and India business delivered another quarter of more than 20% growth in
sales. Strong segment margin expansion of 150 basis points was enabled by
Commercial Excellence, higher sales volumes and productivity and repositioning
benefits.

Now let's move on to Slide 6 to discuss our outlook for the
fourth quarter. The fourth quarter preview reflects the absence of
Transportation Systems for the entire quarter and the anticipated completion of
the Homes spin by the end of October, so only one month of operating results
for Homes is included in our guide. You will see this reflected in the updated
full year outlook as well.

Throughout the year, we have seen strong long-cycle order
rates and a growing backlog, which, in combination with our short-cycle
momentum, we expect will generate 5% to 6% organic sales growth in the quarter.
We expect that segment margins will expand between 60 to 80 basis points,
reflecting a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year margin improvement in PMT
and SPS, as well as margin accretion from the absence of our 2 spun businesses.

We anticipate adjusted earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.90,
which excludes the segment profit contribution net of tax from Garrett for the
full quarter and Resideo for 2 months, as I mentioned, and it includes the
benefit of the indemnification agreements we have with both companies. Removing
the after-tax segment profit contribution from the spins in both periods,
fourth quarter EPS adjusted is expected to be 17% to 20% up. Expected EPS
growth will primarily be driven by strong segment profit growth.

Other key elements include lower share count due to the more
than $2 billion in share repurchases we have done through the third quarter and
higher pension income, offset partially by a higher effective tax rate for the
quarter at approximately 22%.

This outlook incorporates our estimate of the tariff impact
for what is enacted and known as of today. We continue to work those plans to
address the impacts, if any, from other potential tariffs that have been
discussed, but not enacted.

Turning to the segments. We expect continued strength in
Aero, Commercial OE in both air transport and business aviation and in the
aftermarket, driven by flight hours growth. We continue to expect
mid-single-digit aftermarket growth in the fourth quarter. And we expect that
the momentum we have seen in defense will continue, driven by demand for
sensing and guidance systems and spares volumes into U.S. Department of Defense
programs. This is supported by orders growth of more than 40% in the third
quarter and backlog growth of more than 30% as well.

Our outlook for Home and Building Technologies for the
fourth quarter reflects only one month of operations from Homes and a full
quarter of the remaining buildings businesses. We expect continued strength in
Homes from ADI Global Distribution and home products in the month of October
and flattish growth in buildings for the quarter. For buildings, we anticipate
continued strength in the fire business, where we have been growing mid- to
high single digits, offset by slower energy conversion -- conversions in
Building Solutions, as we've discussed previously, as well as declines in China
air and water. The team is launching new buildings products, and we do expect
growth to accelerate into 2019.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, we're
anticipating healthy growth in each of our businesses, with UOP likely the
strongest driver of demand across equipment, engineering and catalyst. UOP's
long-cycle backlog is up more than 10%. We expect continued short-cycle demand
in Process Solutions, software and service offerings, a trend we have seen
throughout 2018, supported by 11% orders growth in the third quarter.

In Advanced Materials, we expect continued strength from
customer adoption of our Solstice low global warming products and Fluorine
Products. Given the anticipated strength in refining catalyst reloads, coupled
with continued strong margin expansion in Process Solutions and Advanced Materials,
margins in PMT will be up sequentially and year-over-year in the fourth
quarter, as we had mentioned previously.

Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, the story
remains robust in the fourth quarter. We anticipate broad-based strength across
all of the businesses led by Intelligrated, safety and China and India. We are
really pleased with SPS' performance this year and expect this to continue into
2019.

Now let's turn to Slide 7 to walk through the bridge to our
full year EPS guidance. Slide 7 presents a walk of the moving pieces in our
earnings bridge for the full year. In August, we raised our guidance to $8.10
to $8.20 based primarily on a stronger outlook for the second half of the year
with a small contribution from our change in asbestos accounting. With the
performance in the third quarter approximately $0.03 above our expectations and
anticipated strength in the fourth quarter, we are raising the low and high end
of a full year guidance before consideration of the spin to an updated range of
$8.22 to $8.27, which is a raise of about $0.10 at the midpoint. The expected
dilution for 3 months of Garrett's earnings and expected 2 months of Resideo's
earnings will be approximately $0.31. There is an approximate $0.04
contribution from the spin-off indemnification agreements related to
Honeywell's legacy liabilities, which nets the spin impact to about $0.27.

As a reminder, on a go-forward basis, beginning in the
fourth quarter, 90% of the expenses net of recoveries related to the covered
liabilities will be reimbursed by Garrett and Resideo. When we take into
account the estimated dilution from the spins net of the indemnification
agreement reimbursement, our new range for adjusted EPS is $7.95 to $8 per
share. That equates to growth of 16% to 17% for the full year, removing the
segment profit contributions from the spins in both periods.

Our guidance continues to reflect a weighted average share
count of 754 million shares and an effective tax rate between 22% and 23%.

Now let's turn to Slide 8 to summarize the details of our
full year guidance. We've seen significant momentum throughout the year. On the
left side of the page, you see the original guidance on our key measures, which
we provided back in December. In the middle of the page is our latest guidance,
reflective of the strength in our end markets, 3 quarters of outperformance and
the dilutive impact from the fourth quarter spin-offs.

We now project organic growth of about 6% for the year,
which is 2 points higher from the high end of our original guidance; a segment
margin range of 50 to 60 basis points, which starts at the high end of our
original range; adjusted EPS of $7.95 to $8 per share, which is $0.40 higher at
the low end and $0.20 higher at the high end of our original range; and
adjusted free cash flow of $5.8 billion to $6.2 billion, which is substantially
above our original projection and represents conversion between 97% and 103%
for the year, all representing very robust performance.

The difference between our reported and organic sales growth
is 3 points in our guidance. We anticipate an approximate 1 point impact from
foreign currency translation, offset by an approximate 4 point impact from our
2 spin-offs.

On the segment guide, Aerospace and Home and Building
Technologies reported sales figures have been revised to reflect the lost sales
and segment profit from the spins. In Aerospace, we also narrowed our organic
sales outlook to the high end of the range based on the strong performance to
date and our strong backlog. We have narrowed the PMT sales guidance to the
midpoint of the previous range. PMT's margin guidance remains the same. In SPS,
we raised our organic sales guidance by 2 points on a high end to 10% and
raised its segment margin guidance to a new range of up 120 to 130 basis
points, or 20 basis points improvement on the high end. This business has
performed well all year long, and we expect a strong finish based on the order
rates, the backlog and the momentum in our short-cycle products businesses.

As you can see, our current guidance is significantly higher
than our original guidance and accounts for the 2018 dilution from our 2
spin-offs in the fourth quarter. As Darius mentioned in his opening, we have
delivered substantial operating results, while executing a major portfolio
change.

Now let's turn to Slide 9. We wanted to provide a little bit
of preliminary framework for 2019, given all the moving parts with the spins,
the liability indemnity and other below-the-line items.

First, starting with the macro environment, we feel very
confident in the strength of our end markets. We see continued demand in
growing industries, including e-commerce, which we addressed with our warehouse
automation offerings from Intelligrated and soon to be Transnorm; commercial aviation,
where we have a strong position on the right platforms that will lead to
healthy aftermarket growth; defense, where we see robust budgets and clarity on
defense spending for the year ahead; and process automation where we expect to
see an eventual pickup in large projects, coupled with continued demand for
software and services.

As we said last quarter, we're proactively managing both the
direct and indirect impacts from the section 232 and section 301 tariffs and
are making necessary changes now for the additional tariffs enacted under List
3 as well as knock-on retaliatory impacts, if any. While we're hopeful there is
ultimately a resolution to the situation, we're planning for the worst and
making structural changes, including modify some sources of supply, seeking
alternative sources and taking other commercial actions as necessary to
position us for 2019 and beyond.

Given that, we continue to expect inflation to accelerate
within the business, and we are working to minimize those impacts with the help
of our procurement, marketing and Commercial Excellence teams. We expect the
impact to be minimal and manageable in 2018 as we previously discussed but now
anticipate that the impact of 2019, prior to mitigation actions, will be
significant. We have established a robust MOS across the company to ensure that
we stay ahead of the situation, though, and we'll continue to rigorously
address any cost increases throughout our supply chain and adjust prices as
necessary. It is our expectation that we'll be able to effectively manage the
situation and still deliver strong results, as we have done through 2018,
though, as you know, this will put some pressure on margin rate expansion.

Moving on to our spin-offs. We estimated the total
associated stranded costs to be approximately $340 million across the business,
with more than 50% of this cost eliminated by the end of this year and the
balance eliminated in 2019, and we feel very good about where we are in that
regard. We have made very good progress, and we're managing this smartly, and
it's a big focus now that the spins are done. We expect that the full year
dilution on a go-forward basis from the 2 spins, net of the indemnity
reimbursement and excluding those remaining stranded cost, will be
approximately $0.90.

In terms of other preliminary figures for 2019, at our
current level of buybacks, we are anticipating at least a 1% reduction in share
count. Due to the measures we took earlier this year to derisk our pension plan
investments, pension income will be approximately $300 million lower
year-over-year. And our funded status is expected to remain well above 100%.

Repositioning funding, we expect to be approximately $325
million next year. Based on our planning for the fourth quarter and the
repositioning we have funded to date in 2018, this represents approximately
$150 million decline year-over-year. We'll continue to take the opportunity to
deploy repositioning funding to improve our supply chain, optimize our fixed
cost and manage on our remaining stranded cost reduction plans.

Finally, with the impact of the legacy liability indemnity
reimbursements from our 2 spin-offs, we expect that asbestos and environmental
will be lower by approximately $425 million. As a reminder, this reduction
represents the 90% of expense that is covered by the indemnification agreement
and is included in the $0.90 of dilution we mentioned earlier. We will provide
you with more details about our expected 2019 performance during our fourth
quarter earnings report and 2019 outlook in January.

Now with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to
Darius, who will wrap up on Slide 10.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Thanks, Greg. The fourth quarter begins
a new chapter for Honeywell. Our 2 spin-offs leave us in even stronger position
with a more focused and growth-oriented portfolio and industry-leading
businesses across attractive end markets. Each has multiple levers to drive
inorganic and organic growth as well as continued margin expansion.

Our cash performance this year has been outstanding, and
there's still room for improvement. Year-over-year free cash flow growth has
exceeded 20% each quarter, and our free cash flow conversion has also improved
significantly. We are rapidly approaching 100% conversion as we demonstrated
this quarter.

Our financial condition is best-in-class with a healthy
balance sheet that provides us with significant capacity to deploy the
dividends, share repurchases and M&A. Our commitment to deploy cash, both
smartly and aggressively, has not changed. Importantly, we have a strong
performance culture. Our say will continue to equal our do. And we are focused
on continuing to outperform for our customers, our shareowners and our
employees. We're looking forward to sharing more exceptional results as well as
our 2019 outlook during our fourth quarter earnings call in late January.

With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.

MARK MACALUSO: Thanks, Darius. Darius and Greg are now
available to answer your questions. So Derrick, if you could, please open the
line for Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is
coming from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank.

NICOLE SHEREE DEBLASE, DIRECTOR & LEAD ANALYST, DEUTSCHE
BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. So maybe I'll start with a couple of
higher-level questions. With the benefit of such a global business that you
guys have touches many different end markets, maybe you could just talk through
what you're seeing around the world, particularly with respect to emerging
markets since we're hearing some concern from investors about potential project
pushouts, slowdown in short-cycle activity, et cetera.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I'll take that one. I mean,
certainly, we're seeing a little bit of -- China has to be the highlight. And
certainly, Q3 was not as robust as some of the quarters that we saw in the
first half. So there's -- we did have some tough comp -- tougher comps than we
expected. We had some challenges in our air and water business, which has been
throughout the year. So I'm not alarmed yet. But certainly, Q3 was a bit slower
in terms of growth. I mean, we grew the Chinese market, but not at the
double-digit pace that we saw earlier in the year. So that's probably my #1
area to watch. I'm not -- I wouldn't say I'm concerned about it yet, but
certainly an area of focus. On the flip side of the coin, we -- U.S. was
extraordinarily robust. Think about 9% to 10% kind of a growth rate in the U.S.
and was probably at the other end of the spectrum. We continue to be very
bullish on the U.S. markets, and I expect that to continue. And then sort of
the rest of the globe was a little bit of mixed bag. I mean, Southeast Asia
business was good. We had a really nice recovery in our Latin American
business. That was really good to see. That's been a focus for our business
activities throughout the year, and we see that coming back. Middle East was
okay. India was a bit slower than we anticipated, but we expect a pretty good
recovery in Q4. So all in all, I mean, there's certainly some puts and takes,
very encouraged by what we're seeing in North America with a focus on China as
we head into Q4.

NICOLE SHEREE DEBLASE: That was really comprehensive. And I
guess, just shifting to capital allocation, just some thoughts as you head into
2019. Maybe it was good to see Transnorm come through recently, but how robust
is the pipeline? And I guess, if M&A doesn't come through as you expect, is
there scope to go higher than that 1% reduction in share count that you're kind
of earmarking for 2019?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, yes. And I think that's why in the
-- we're very careful to pick our wording in the press release, which is at --
you should expect at least 1% share count reduction. The 1% is roughly
commensurate with the $3 billion that I already committed to. But you're spot on.
Your comment is exactly right. That's the way we think about capital
allocation. And then depending upon what happens in M&A, we'll potentially
do buybacks. There are a couple of things that, we think, we could get done and
announce maybe even as possibly in Q4, probably not close in Q4. So -- but I
never really count the M&A transactions until they are signed and done. So
I want to monitor that, quickly, we have been in the market early in Q4 as we
pointed out in the press release. I thought they were some attractive price
points for us and continue to be. But yes, that's -- the framework you're
thinking of is exactly the one we used, which is we kind of have a toggle list
between M&A and buyback. As I said, I would prefer M&A, but it's -- as
I've said on multiple earnings call now, it continues to be a challenged
environment. And unfortunately, it's kind of becoming the new normal, although
we were thrilled to pick up the Transnorm acquisition at, I think, an
attractive entry point, well, from a price point, but a really important entry
point into Europe for our Intelligrated business. Not only is it a terrific
acquisition on its own, it also gives us that really nice foothold in Europe
with just an outstanding business.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from
Vertical Research Partners.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, VERTICAL
RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: I was wondering if we could get just a little bit more
help on the bridge. Greg, I think you said the guide reflects 16% to 17% pro
forma growth for 2018. Could you just baseline us on what that implies for
segment OP dollars in 2018 for Aero and HBT as if the spins were out on a full
year basis?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Jeff, in terms of the absolute dollars, I
don't think we're going to highlight specifically those numbers directly. But
the $0.31 represents -- you could think about that as close to linear, but not
exactly because of the stub period that we've got in Homes because we are
getting only one month of the Homes results in that $0.31. So you could think
about it as almost linear, but not quite. I mean, that -- we've got both fourth
quarter high degree of profit that we're losing in December and November. The
Resideo side is going to be a little bit less clear from that perspective. But
it's -- the $0.31 is close to linear, but not exactly.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: And then just on the $0.90. So it
sounds like stranded cost would be an incremental headwind on top of that, if
you could clarify that. But is there any deployment of the spin dividends of
$2.8 billion in that construct?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: No, the $0.90 is just simply the lost
segment profit on an after-tax basis and net of the reduction in our
below-the-line expenses associated with the indemnity. As we've talked about,
the $340 million of stranded cost, which we feel very good about our progress
in terms of eliminating that so far, is not included in that number. And we'll
update you more on that as we get into the January guidance and we finish the
year out. You can imagine that we -- as we've said, we've taken out, by the end
of this year, greater than 50% of that. And we feel like we're in a good
position. We're turning our attention from a spin perspective, from getting the
deal done to the sustainability side and there'll be a lot of focus on that,
but that is not in the $0.90 at this point in time. And in terms of the usage
of the spin dividends, Darius talked about the capital deployment framework,
and we'll utilize that as firepower for executing around that framework. But it
is not precisely included in any way in that $0.90.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: I'm sorry. Just one other for
clarification. When you say net of indemnity, do you mean only kind of the $315
million or so that Garrett and Resideo "owe you" and then we've got
an incremental tailwind to get to that $425 million that you're talking about
on lower asbestos and environmental?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes -- no. Think -- again, think about
that as asbestos and indemnity for 2018 and the knock-on effect of the 90%
reduction on a year-over-year basis in those 2 particular line items.
Obviously, in the asbestos side, NARCO has nothing to do with that, so we have
to take that out. But that's the way to think about it.

MARK MACALUSO: And Jeff, this is Mark, if I could. Just to
be clear that the caps, the $315 million cap that we cited in August, that is
the cash payment cap, right? And so as we had said in August, the expenses,
whatever they are, could be higher and that, from a P&L perspective, could
be closer to the $0.40 we cited in the release. So I think that's where you're
getting tripped up. There's a $0.40 expense. Separately, there is an annual
cash payment cap in respect to any year that's $315 million.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes. So that's -- when we gave the $0.40,
again, that was, call that, a framework. But the actual value of what's going
to be in the P&L may be higher or lower, depending on how things go. And
the $425 million is reflective of where we see 2018 expense in those 2
categories.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski
from Morgan Stanley.

JOSHUA CHARLES POKRZYWINSKI, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes, just maybe to dig into PMT on a couple of questions.
First, with the recent ruling out of SCOTUS on the -- on some of the HFC stuff,
how does impact maybe some of the trajectory from -- for Solstice from here?
And then, I guess, a follow-up on that on some of the refinery comments.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, It doesn't because, as you
may recall, that although -- despite that ruling, there are quite a few states
that are still adapting the HFO regulation and greenhouse gas emission. So as
of right now, we don't see much of an impact yet. We're continuing to work with
the regulatory bodies, both at the federal and the state level. And at the
present time, we don't anticipate substantial impact. And frankly, a lot of the
companies that we're working with are on that path anyway. And again, that --
obviously that's only a U.S. issue. What was your second question on PMT?

JOSHUA CHARLES POKRZYWINSKI: Yes. So I guess, more broadly
in -- with some of the environment going on there, particularly IMO 2020 and
refiner starting to redeploy, I think UOP is set to have a good shipment
quarter in 4Q. How much of that are you seeing in the business today versus
maybe extended visibility into 2019? Just trying to calibrate as refiner spend
when it helps Honeywell specifically.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, typically, refiners kind of
wait until the last moment, so -- with a lot of that investment, so that's what
sort of surprised us. So we expect '19 to be a good year. But the numbers speak
for themselves. With UOP backlog up double digit, that gives me a good sign,
strong booking rates. Sort of the margin challenges that were evident in Q3, we
very much expected. We communicated those in Q2. We knew that they were going
to be dilutive. But by the way, that reverses in Q4 based on the mix of
products that we ship. So overall, we're very bullish on UOP and what they're going
to do. And like I said, I -- at the end of the day, I look at the numbers. And
when I see backlog up double digit like it is, I'm very encouraged as we head
into 2019 and beyond.

JOSHUA CHARLES POKRZYWINSKI: Got you. And then just one
quick one for Greg on free cash. I think you guys talked about a lot of moving
pieces on the pension side and then on the indemnity side, maybe some P&L
hit that doesn't quite come through on the cash payments. How should we think
high level about free cash conversion for 2019, inclusive of the spins and the
moving pieces there?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes. Again, I think you should think about
cash conversion next year as approaching 100% even ex spins. We feel like we're
getting into that neighborhood this year and -- with the continued opportunity
that we do have in working capital, we've made really nice strides, as I
highlighted 0.6 of a turn improvement year-over-year. And this quarter, in
particular, was sequentially better than last quarter by 2 to 3 times as well.
We feel like we still have more opportunity to go. So we're still going to be
targeting something, plus or minus, a couple of points to 100% as that number
will move a little bit over time depending on specifics. But we feel very good
about our ability to live in that range.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. And Josh, I think we're extremely
proud of what we've been able to achieve on the working capital side. If you
recall, a couple of years ago, I -- I've made this a priority for the business
for us to really monitor the balance sheet as much as we monitor the P&L
statement. And this kind of for a growth rate that you're seeing, 7% top line,
our working capital is down more than $600 million. I mean, that's -- I'm very
proud of the Honeywell team in terms of what they've been able to accomplish on
that perspective, and it's coming through in our cash performance.

OPERATOR: We'll next move to Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: So just on the orders, you kind of threw out defense. You threw out
the HPS orders, Intelligrated, obviously. When you think about kind of the
long-cycle businesses, what were total orders up for the long-cycle businesses
for the quarter? Kind of in total or if you just want to kind of list maybe a
couple ones we didn't hear, like UOP or something like that, I don't know. What
were total orders up for long-cycle businesses?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. To give you a specific, it's --
they're up 26% year-over-year. Our backlog is up 14% for long cycle. And then
just to give you a couple of the specifics: HPS projects, up 27%; HBS projects,
up 22%. Intelligrated was actually flat. And -- but keep in mind, they're up
40% year-to-date, so this was tough comps. We're not -- trust me, I'm not
worried one bit about the growth in the Intelligrated business. And so that's
why I'm pretty excited today. I mean, when I -- I always worry about tomorrow
and when I see those kinds of numbers come through, I have good reason for
optimism. And I think it points to a very bright 2019 and beyond.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. And then just kind of attacking
the kind of the base question in a little bit of different way. And again, this
is merely just kind of like math on actuals. Just using the kind of prior Aero
guide of about $3.7 billion and stripping out kind of a $500 million number
last 9 months for -- or for the year for transpo gets me down to kind of around
$3.1 billion. Is that kind of the right Aero pro forma, roughly? I mean, that's
just basic math on what you guys have kind of already given.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: I think you're in the neighborhood, yes. I
think you're in the neighborhood.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. And then just for HBT, kind of
similar math gets me to around $1.1 billion type of number. Those -- are those
-- did that sound right?

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Let us check that one and make sure that
one's obviously a little bit less precise given the Homes buildings split. But
we'll come back to you on that one, particularly.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. And then just one last one for
you. The restructuring next year is a little bit higher than I would have
expected. I don't view that as necessarily a negative. But what is -- when all
is said and done, given that it seems like everybody is -- wants to ignore restructuring
at other companies these days, what is kind of the normal run rate
restructuring number for you guys in this kind of new construct going forward
-- do you think, longer term?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, I don't know if there's such a
thing as normal number. It is dropping significantly year-over-year by more
than $100 million, so it's coming down. Some of it is commensurate with the
slightly smaller Honeywell. But we still have -- as you recall back the EPG,
one of the things we have plenty of runway for and Torsten's #1 mission, our
new Head of Integrated Supply Chain, is to really reduce our fixed cost base.
So that's where most of that funding is going to be going next year. And it's a
fairly substantial change in terms of the cost structure of Honeywell in, a,
reducing it and, b, making it -- converting it from being much more
fixed-oriented to variable-oriented. So we're going to need some continued
restructuring funding. I don't know if I can give you sort of a normal number.
I would think that it's still going to be elevated at kind of the levels we've
projected for '19 and probably for '20 and probably, after that, come down a
bit more as we get some of that heavy lifting done. So that's the way to kind
of frame it up and think about it.

OPERATOR: We'll next go to Scott Davis with Melius Research.

SCOTT REED DAVIS, FOUNDING PARTNER, CHAIRMAN, CEO &
RESEARCH ANALYST OF MULTI-INDUSTRY RESEARCH, MELIUS RESEARCH LLC: It's not much
to pick on, for sure, but one of the things that was thrown out there when
you're doing the spins was potentially doing buildings with the resi business,
and you didn't -- you kept buildings. What gets you excited about buildings
turning? I mean, this has long been really a kind of a 3%-ish growth business,
not really much better than GDP, probably not better than GDP. But you said in
your prepared remarks some new products and things like that. So give us kind
of a sales pitch, if you will, on why you kept that business.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well -- yes, first of all, let's
start with Connected Buildings. I think our technology offering in Connected
Buildings is maybe as further along than any of the other connected. I mean, we
have ready-to-go technologies that we're currently offering and selling. And
you heard an example of that in our pitch this morning. So I'm very excited
that we really need to be much more commercially savvy to really clearly
explain to our customers what that will do for in their building in terms of
energy consumption, comfort, security, well-being of the occupants and so on.
So I'm very excited about that technology. And it's not futuristic, it's here
and now. I think we just got to get through the commercial challenges that
we're facing. Number two is the market dynamics between the resi and the
commercials are very different. The competitors are different. I feel good
about our position. I feel good about the installed base we have. I think it's
a business that can and should do more. Three is I think we also have to
remember that we created this Homes P&L from scratch. I mean, think about
this, Scott. I mean, we did more than 20 manufacturing transitions in a course
of a year. If I didn't have that kind of hard deadlines, and we're going to get
this done in the year, that would have probably taken 3. So that team has been
-- done a tremendous job in executing that kind of heavy lift. And I think they
performed pretty well given that kind of a distraction. So I'm -- now that,
that's basically behind them, I'm going to monitor it and I'm going to be --
continue to be optimistic about what we're doing. I was with Vimal Kapur and
his team earlier this week. And they've got their hand on the pulse. And I
think that could be very successful business for us.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Fair enough. Transnorm seems interesting,
but I don't know the company very well. I mean, can you just give us a little
sense of what, other than the installed base that you're getting, I mean, what
you're getting from a standpoint of technology? And is there something that you
can -- the synergies at least of Intelligrated, is that something you can take
more Intelligrated to Europe and more Transnorm to the U.S.? Or does it not
work that way?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No, it does work that way. In fact,
Intelligrated was a customer of Transnorm. So we know the product. It is IP
protected. It is actually technology differentiated, has a high aftermarket and
services component, which I always look for in any business. It has a very
enviable position in Europe. And frankly, I was looking for beachhead to land
in Europe in Intelligrated. We've been spending a lot of organic dollars, what
I call, just part of their R&D and sales and commercial build-out to have a
broader presence in Europe. Our U.S. customers have been asking us to really have
a broader presence in Europe. And I frankly wanted to add a business that gives
us a much broader foothold. On top of that, I really like the business. We were
able to pick it up at what I view as a very appealing price in this kind of a
market environment that we're in with differentiated technology and IP
protection. So I think it's -- I'm thrilled. And as you know, Scott, I really
like the warehouse automation space.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from
Citi.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ, MD AND U.S. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR HEAD,
CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Darius, Aerospace has continued strength in
here this cycle. And obviously, you do have more difficult comparisons in '19,
but it's hard not to notice the momentum that Honeywell has given its share on
new business jet platforms that are coming to the market. You've talked about
connectivity. Defense, obviously, strong. So as you look at the continued
product ramp in '19, does it seem like the visibility here toward, call it,
above-normal cycle growth in Aero is higher than usual in '19 and then maybe
beyond?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, yes. We continue to be bullish in
Aero. I mean, as you look at our backlog position, there's no reason not to be.
But your initial point is right, too, which is our comps get a little bit
tougher given the kind of growth rates that we've seen. What -- and if you look
at the -- a little more details of the numbers, the 2 that really pop out at
you, especially here in Q3, is one is the growth in the business jet market.
That's been -- that hasn't been a high performer for quite a while. I mean --
and now it's starting to really pop as a lot of the new platforms are being
introduced into the marketplace. And two, the used equipment inventory is down.
I mean, it's down substantially, which is always a good time -- a good sign in
terms of new equipment sales. And in Defense & Space, defense is --
continues to be very strong. We don't think that, that's going to change as we
head into 2019. Potentially, it could be a slight down arrow in terms of OE
momentum. I don't really expect that to be the case, but that's maybe the only
place where I'm a little bit nervous. But all in all, I continue to be pretty
bullish on the Aerospace segment because all 3 of these tracks that we always
kind of talk about, which is the commercial, the business jet and defense, are
all kind of pointing either strongly up or up. So 2019 looks very promising
based on what we're seeing today.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ: Darius, that's helpful. And maybe,
Darius or Greg, you mentioned that tariff impacts, so far, have been
manageable. You continue to work -- to mitigate all the tariff impacts. But
maybe could you elaborate in your comments? I think, Greg, you said that
tariffs impacts in '19 could impact margin. How much more ability do you have
to price increase in tariffs? When you talked about changes that you might
make, you talked about sort of looking at your supply chain. So maybe more
color there, if possible.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Sure. Yes, so in our last discussions, we
talked about the fact that what we're seeing in 2018 in terms of pressure was
in the tens of millions of dollars. And as you bring List 3 and List 4 into
play and you layer that on over the entirety of 2019, that starts getting into
more like triple digits, hundreds of millions of dollars. And we still feel
good about our ability to price in the market. And we've been successful and
continue to take aggressive approaches in that regard. And then as it relates
to changes in supply chain, we talked about the fact that we're
local-for-local, and that's been very helpful for us. But we are making a few
small moves. You're not going to see us make big overhauls to the supply chain.
But there are certain spots where, strategically, we are going to make a couple
of changes in those flows. So again, the challenge -- the hill gets steeper.
But the level of rigor and attention to this has been at a very high level for
the last 8 months and is going to continue as we go into 2019. The pressure comment
is, as you know, when you price in the market and you price cost up, so revenue
goes up and margins go up by a commensurate amount, but that's just a pressure
on your margin rate. So that's really what I was referring to there, not so
much that we're not going to be able to cover the profit impact of the
inflation itself. but it just -- that inflationary environment with pricing
turns into a margin expansion challenge on the upside.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: And Andy, if I could just add. I think
there's a lot of unknowns, right? I mean, you have List 3, which, potentially,
that rate goes up at the end of the year. And then you have a potential List 4
with timing, which isn't particularly clear. So there's a lot of unknowns here.
We -- we're working through all the knowns. And I feel very confident in the
process that we're building. And I can tell you, all of our businesses are all
over this in terms of taking any and all levers they can. But still a lot of
unknowns in terms of what's going to happen at the end of the year, what's on
List 4, the level of List 4 and timing. So we're prepared. We're ready to act.
And we're trying to mitigate the best we can.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from
Jefferies.

SHEILA KARIN KAHYAOGLU, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Darius, it seems you're building a very focused Aerospace
company, but maybe in a more measured manner. Just looking at Aerospace post
Garrett. It looks to be somewhat accretive to margin and maybe eliminates the business
that wasn't a perfect fit within that group. What sort of opportunities arise
for the Aerospace segment in terms of profitability? And maybe how are you
thinking about the rest?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, I think that the Aerospace
group has been very good at a couple of things, especially in the last couple
of years. Number one is they certainly continue to drive productivity and
becoming much more efficient. There's a high level of expertise in terms of
what they can accomplish. And I think they're far from done, so there's further
opportunity to do that. Number two is they're much more installed base focused
in terms of the upgrades, enhancements, software enhancements and so on, which
obviously continue to build accretion to the margin rate. And overall, I like
how the team is executing. They won a lot -- they've had great wins in a lot of
different platforms. And the execution is strong. And I particularly like the
progress on the commercial side of the business. And Connected Aircraft continues
to be a very big opportunity, which we materialized. Longer term, and I pointed
this out, is we look for a 25-plus kind of a margin rate. We think that, that's
very possible in that business. And we're going to continue to make -- march
forward as Tim and the team continue to make progress there.

OPERATOR: We'll next go to Andrew Obin with Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN, MD, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Yes. Just a question. When was the last time that U.S. grew faster
than China for you guys?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: That's a very good point. It's been a
while, but it's interesting how the global markets are evolving right now. And
as I look into 2019 kind of an take is, I think, U.S. is going to be a very
robust market again. Now there's a lot of moving pieces in the geopolitical
environment right now. But right now, it continues to look strong.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: And I guess, a follow-up question on
that. How is your strategy? You had a strategy really focusing on High Growth
Regions. U.S. is going to be a key market, but not really a growth market. How
are you thinking about capacity availability in the U.S.? For example, some of
your competitors are talking on process, specifically shortage of engineers.
They are sort of at the limit, not really able to take more projects. And are
we seeing contagion from China in High Growth Regions? So just a follow-up
question.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think I'm very encouraged
and thrilled to see the kind of growth rates -- GDP growth rate we're seeing
the U.S. I think it's been terrific. But as you look at -- overall, if you look
at the GDP growth in some of the High Growth Regions, over the long term,
they're still likely to be higher than the U.S. I mean, obviously, U.S. has increased
its rate. But -- so our high-growth focused strategy, I think, is still spot on
and needs to be. And we're going to stay committed to growing in High Growth
Regions as well as the U.S. In terms of investment and profile and so on, I
mean, I've always said all along that I believe in being local-for-local,
meaning that I want to be able to serve North America from North America. I
want to be able to serve China from China and Europe from Europe. I -- to me,
that just makes perfect sense. I want to have people that have a mindset for
the local markets, both from a R&D, manufacturing, sales, marketing, all
these perspective. And now as we kind of restructure and look out our fixed
cost base, it's exactly the model we're going to. We're pretty mature along the
path already. But to the -- the short story is, to the extent I continue to see
this kind of a growth in the U.S., we're obviously going to be continuing to
invest in increasing our capacity here in the U.S. to make sure we properly
serve the market. And based on what we're seeing this year, we're going to be
investing in 2019.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: And if I could slip one more. You sort
of highlighted that productivity was a contributor to strong cash flow. It's
just very impressive that despite very robust growth, this business is
generating working capital. What about the business model that enables this
generation? Is there a payback? Or is this a kind of business that can actually
generate robust cash flows as it grows?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, I think it can. Number one is sort
of the business profile and the timing of payments, particularly for our
projects business, they are very favorable. Number two, they've done a terrific
job in managing their working capital. It's a point of focus and emphasis.
Three, and this is something we've done across our business, which is we're
really relooking and standardizing some of our terms and conditions. That's
been -- frankly, I would say it wasn't the sort of cleanest structure that we
had. And now we're really standardizing and cleaning that up, and it's
generating benefits. And that's not just for SPS. It's really true of all of
our businesses. So a lot of things moving in the right direction there, for --
certainly for SPS, but all of our businesses as well.

OPERATOR: We'll next go to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.

NIGEL EDWARD COE, MD & SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, WOLFE
RESEARCH, LLC: So just more of a comment than a question. You've got 2% price
this quarter, so it seemed like you're in good shape to manage the extra
inflationary pressures from tariffs. But you're the only one talking about a
potential List 4 of the companies out there so far. So I'm wondering, are you
sort of working on the basic assumption that the 25% goes in place in January
and that we get a List 4? And are you taking preemptive actions to sort of
anticipate and get ahead of those potentials?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, the short answer is yes. I
mean, we are getting ready. I'm not saying we're necessarily pulling the
trigger on all those actions. But I think we always -- the way we kind of think
about things is we always have to assume the worst case situation and then be
prepared. We haven't pulled all the levers for the 25% yet, but we're going to
be ready. And we're assuming that, that will happen, frankly. And we think
that, that probably is obviously increasing as more time goes by, and we have
to be ready. So I would say, not all the levers have been pulled yet, but we're
certainly preparing them and feel very good about our ability to mitigate all
or most of that impact.

NIGEL EDWARD COE: Okay. And then a quick -- a very quick
follow-on, on converted free cash flow because to my mind, that was the real
highlight in a great quarter. You called out SPS and PMT as particularly strong
contributors to cash. Is that because Aero and HBT were -- with the spins
weren't producing quite a good conversion? Or was there some catch-up here? I
mean, maybe any commentary in terms of free cash conversion by business would
be helpful.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. But I'll start and maybe turn it
over. I think you've nailed it, Nigel. I mean, from an HBT perspective, when
you do -- when you have to do 2 spins and have to do these many transitions,
there is some level of inefficiency, particularly in the inventory situation
because we're doing a lot of planned separations and so on. And I -- as I
stated before, I think the team has done just an incredible job to get us
ready. Aero, they've done a great job on receivables, their payables and so on.
But inventory is still an opportunity. I think we all know about some of the
challenges that the Aerospace supply chain is facing, so there's probably
further gains to be made there. But they've done a really nice job. And then
SPS has been tremendous across the board, whether we talk about all 3 elements
of working capital, advances and so on. And then PMT, they're really picking up
the pace, particularly in receivables. They've had a lot of past dues that are
now coming in. And really nice momentum in building into Q4. And we think that
there's even more upside there.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes -- no. Aero is up, so they had a good
performance, too. I think they just had a head start in terms of the
disciplined aspects, as Darius talked about, with things like terms and so on.
So in many ways, we're actually modeling a lot of the Aerospace processes and
behaviors in what we're trying to do elsewhere. So you should definitely not
take that comment as Aero is not doing well. They actually are growing their
cash flow quite nicely, also.

OPERATOR: And our final question comes from Julian Mitchell
from Barclays.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Maybe just a quick question on HPS. I think in process, you
talked about a lot of the strength still being short-cycle driven. So just
wondered what you're seeing in terms of greenfield projects, large orders.
There's obviously some movement in the LNG area, but maybe some offset from
macro uncertainty on large projects in general. So maybe just how you see the
greenfield demand.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, Julian, I think the
highlight number for me for HPS is projects. We're up 27% year-over-year in Q3.
I mean, that's -- I think that number speaks for itself. So it's a very
impressive number. It gives you an idea that, that business continues to win in
the marketplace. And I'm very bullish. That's coupled on top of a short-cycle
growth, particularly in services and our software businesses. And overall, it
continues to do very well. So there's not really much other than good news
coming from the HPS world.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL: And then my last one would just be
around buildings. You talked about the expectation of an improvement in growth
there in '19 and probably beyond. Do you anticipate needing much of a step-up
in R&D or CapEx or M&A to help drive that growth or you think the run
rate of investments is sufficient right now?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think -- on R&D, I think it's
-- I would say it's not necessarily a need to increase the R&D levels, but
really just to streamline and optimize that investment around things that
really matter. I think that there's -- frankly, there's a little bit of an
opportunity around that area. And Vimal and team are making sure that we're investing
in the proper things and really on things that move the needle and not kind of
the incrementalism, which require a lot of investment that really don't
generate great returns. And I think it's certainly an area of opportunity. But
I think some of the really high-performing businesses, like fire, which have
continued to do very well, it's not all bad news. And I think there are a lot
of good things going on in the buildings part of the portfolio already. But
certainly, like in any large business, there's couple of things we also need to
improve. So I'm very confident that the team is going to get it done.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes. And just again back to the spin
taking away the distraction of having to split the company in 2 fundamentally,
that took the effort of the entire organization to go do. And now having that
done, they're going to have a lot more time and attention to be able to drive
some of that growth, as Darius highlighted, which we feel very good about the
end market and our position there. So it should be good.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. And just to echo what Greg said, I
think we all probably underestimated the amount of time, effort and
organizational focus it takes to do 2 spins at the same time, particularly when
you really are creating a new P&L, call it, home. So I -- I'm thrilled with
the execution that the team has exhibited.

GREGORY P. LEWIS: Yes. You talked about the supply chain
changes, but we also -- we had the clone ERP systems. This was definitely a
heavy lift to go do, so that team did great job.

OPERATOR: That concludes today's question-and-answer
session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Darius
Adamczyk for any additional closing remarks.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Thank you. Before I end, I want to thank
the Honeywell employees and leaders that will begin new careers at Garrett and
Resideo for their contributions to the company. Both businesses are starting
with strong foundation, a great heritage, and I'm confident both will be very
successful. We look forward to watching their accomplishment as new public
companies. I have full confidence that the strong performance Honeywell
delivered for our shareowners in the first 3 quarters of 2018 will continue
through the year-end. Our order rates are strong. Our backlogs are growing.
We're realizing the benefits of our continued efforts to drive software and
Connected growth, productivity, Commercial Excellence and improved free cash
flow. It is an exciting time to be at Honeywell. And we look forward to sharing
more on our progress as we head into 2019. Have a wonderful weekend.

OPERATOR: This does conclude today's teleconference, please

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
Honeywell's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As
a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to
introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of
Investor Relations.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thanks,
Kathy. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings
Conference Call. With me here today are our Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk;
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek; and Vice
President of Corporate Finance, Greg Lewis.

This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP
reconciliations, are available on our website at 

. Note that elements of this
presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view
of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can
change, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the
principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our annual
report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.

For this call, references to earnings per share, free cash
flow, free cash flow conversion and effective tax rate exclude impacts from
separation costs related to the planned spinoff of our Homes and Transportation
Systems businesses as well as the recent tax legislation, except where
otherwise noted.

This morning, we'll review our financial results for the
second quarter of 2018, share our guidance for the third quarter and provide an
update to our 2018 outlook. And as always, we'll leave time for your questions
at the end.

So with that, I will turn the call over to Chairman and CEO,
Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, CEO &
PRESIDENT, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning,
everyone. Honeywell delivered another outstanding quarter of earnings per share
of $2.12, up 18% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range.
Using our effective tax rate guidance for the quarter of 24%, earnings per
share was $2.06 or $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range. Tom will
take you through these details momentarily.

Our earnings this quarter were driven by organic sales
growth of 6%. The sales growth was strong across the portfolio with
double-digit growth in the Aerospace defense business and the SPS warehouse
automation business. We expect the sales momentum to continue throughout the
second half of the year as our long-cycle orders were up 11% and our long-cycle
backlog was up 14% with noteworthy backlog strength in Intelligrated, defense,
business aviation, UOP and HPS services. I will touch on our revised full year
guidance in a minute.

We expanded segment margin by 60 basis points, which also
exceeded our guide. Strong operational performance drove our exceptional margin
result, and we benefited from higher volumes, continued investments in
commercial excellence and mature productivity. We achieved these results while
investing in our future, particularly in connected enterprises, research and development
and in our global sales force. So far, we've also overcome the impacts of
inflation. Greg will cover that in more detail later in the call.

Free cash flow was again a highlight this quarter at about
$1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year, excluding separation costs. Conversion
this quarter was 108%, the highest second quarter conversion we've had in 5
years. This continues the improving trends we saw in the first quarter as our
HOS Gold working capital tool set continues to deliver results.

Finally, we continued to aggressively deploy capital,
repurchasing about $800 million in Honeywell shares. In total, in the first
half, we repurchased about $1.7 billion in Honeywell shares as we continue to
take advantage of our opportunities in the marketplace to be more aggressive
from a capital deployment perspective.

We're also tracking well against the cash repatriation plan
we reviewed at our Investor Day in February, which contemplated more than $4
billion of cash being repatriated in 2018. We brought back nearly $2.2 billion
into the U.S. through the second quarter.

Today, we are raising our full year 2018 organic sales
growth guidance to a new range of up to 5% to 6%, our segment margin expansion
to 40 to 60 basis points, our EPS guidance to a new range of $8.05 to $8.15 or
up 13% to 15% and our full year free cash flow guidance to $5.6 billion to $6.2
billion. Compared to prior range, our EPS guidance is now $0.20 higher at the
low end and $0.10 higher at the high end. These changes reflect both our second
quarter performance and our confidence in the company's ability to continue
outperforming for the remainder of the year.

Our end markets are strong. We're executing well, as
evidenced by our margin and cash performance, and we have significant balance
sheet capacity still to deploy. I'm encouraged by our performance to date and
expect more of the same in the second half.

Let's turn to Slide 3 to highlight some of the recent
exciting news in our businesses.

In Aerospace, Dassault Aviation launched FalconConnect, a
comprehensive solution designed to facilitate use, management of -- and control
of in-flight connectivity. FalconConnect is powered by Honeywell's routers,
services ground infrastructure and GoDirect connectivity services and is
designed to make connectivity as efficient as possible for operators, crews and
passengers. It includes both classic and high-speed cabin Internet, cockpit
safety links, standard ground communications and a wide range of value-added
services designed to maximize data control and minimize costs. FalconConnect is
available on all Dassault Falcon jets, making Honeywell GoDirect the preferred
service provider for operators flying Falcons.

Last month, Honeywell released a comprehensive study about
the connected aircraft, which found that the commercial aviation industry is at
the beginning of a 5-year technology investment wave fueled by the advances in
high-speed in-flight WiFi connectivity. The study found that about half of the
respondents expect to spend up to $1 million per aircraft on connectivity
technologies over the next year and 17% of respondents expect to spend more
than $10 million per aircraft over the next 5 years. Honeywell is at the
forefront of innovation when it comes to connected aircraft, and we are well
positioned to continue to win in this fast-growing space.

In Home and Building Technologies, the building owner of the
Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest structure, is currently piling a Honeywell
connected building outcome-based service, which uses building performance data
to focus maintenance activities where they are most needed in order to improve
operational efficiency, maximize uptime and improve the integrity of the
security systems. So far, the pilot, which encompassed the mechanical
components of the Burj Khalifa's HVAC system, has resulted in a 40% reduction
in total maintenance hours and a significant reduction in unplanned reactive
maintenance, helping the building operators lower their maintenance cost for
this landmark facility in Dubai.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, ExxonMobil
announced that the Honeywell Process Solutions' Experion LCN software approach
to migrate their legacy installed base DCS systems eliminates the need for
costly rip and replace DCS migrations. Experion LCN enables infinite longevity
of our customers' DCS systems by preserving their intellectual property.
ExxonMobil indicated that Honeywell exceeded their expectations, met their
challenge 2 years ahead of the schedule and gave Honeywell an A on the
development of this unique and cost-effective offering. The comments were made
at Honeywell Users Conference Group, or HUG, which took place in San Antonio
last month. The event brings together more than 1,300 customers, channel
partners, suppliers and other industry participants from 32 countries to
discuss the latest technology and innovations in the process automation space.

Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, Honeywell
Intelligrated provided the material handling equipment design, installation and
support for Amazon's new more than 0.5 million square foot distribution center
north of Calgary. Once it opens later this year, the facility will complement a
larger network of Amazon fulfillment centers throughout Canada.

The Intelligrated system includes more than 4,800 linear
meters of conveyor, an IntelliSort high-speed slide and shoe routing sorter,
which achieves the highest speeds of any piece of equipment in the facility
while maintaining the precision to handle even fragile items and an even bigger
IntelliSort cross-belt shipping sorter that stretches 529 meters in length.
This system helps workers efficiently pick, pack and ship orders so they arrive
on the customer's doorsteps on time.

Our connected offerings are transforming the industries in
which we participate, leveraging our large installed base to help our customers
gain a competitive advantage in the markets they serve.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will
discuss our second quarter results in more detail.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK, SENIOR VP & CFO, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Well, thank you, Darius. Good morning. Let me begin on
Slide 4. As Darius mentioned, we delivered another quarter that was strong
across the portfolio and in every financial metric. Organic growth was
widespread, with about 70% of the portfolio growing organically 5% or more in
the quarter and about 2/3 of our organic growth coming from increased volumes.
The markets we serve are strong, and our continued organic sales growth
reflects our leading market positions and the investments we've made in new
products and in our sales organization.

The difference between reported and organic sales is
primarily the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar in the first half compared to
2017. For example, the euro averaged about $1.20 in the second quarter of '18
versus about $1.10 in 2017.

Segment profit was up 12% in the quarter, and segment margin
expanded by 60 basis points to 19.6%, primarily due to the benefits from higher
sales volumes, commercial excellence and material productivity. Earnings per
share of $2.12, up 18%, and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by
$0.09. This excludes spin-related separation costs of $346 million in the
quarter. We'll walk through the details of the EPS shortly.

Free cash flow in the second quarter of $1.7 billion, up
42%, driven by strong operational performance, particularly in Aerospace and
PMT. As Darius mentioned, we continue to be encouraged by the progress on our
working capital initiatives and by the additional opportunities that we've discovered
through this effort.

We continue to deploy capital and in the quarter,
repurchased about $800 million of Honeywell shares, bringing our year-to-date
share repurchases to about $1.7 billion. After growth investments and paying a
competitive dividend, our preference is to deploy capital to M&A. But in
the absence of immediate opportunities, we'll continue to opportunistically
repurchase outstanding shares. As Greg will share with you shortly, we
anticipate continuing this repurchase activity in the second half. Overall,
strong performance across the board.

Slide 5 walks our earnings per share from the second quarter
of 2017 to the second quarter of 2018. The majority of our earnings growth,
$0.24, came from segment profit improvement, driven by enhanced sales volumes
across the company, the impacts from our commercial excellence efforts,
productivity improvements realized through HOS Gold and savings from previously
funded and executed restructuring projects.

Below the line items were a $0.05 tailwind this quarter,
primarily due to higher pension income, driven by the strong investment
performance in the plan and a lower discount rate. This impact was partially
offset by higher funding or new repositioning and other projects in the
quarter, including about $60 million in high-return restructuring projects.

The share repurchase actions in the second quarter resulted
in a lower weighted average share count of 755 million shares. Combined with
the slightly higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, the share
repurchases were a $0.04 tailwind to EPS.

We had planned and guided our tax rate at 24% for the
quarter compared to 21.3% last year, which would have resulted in a $0.07
headwind to EPS. At this higher 24% planned tax rate, earnings per share would
have been $2.06, above the high end of our guidance range by $0.03. We realized
a further $0.06 EPS upside from the lower actual tax rate of 21.7% versus that
24% guided rate for the quarter. The tax rate was lower than guided primarily
due to the successful resolution of several tax audits. So on a year-over-year
basis then, the actual tax rate for the second quarter of 21.7% was slightly
higher than the tax rate for 2017 of 21.3%. And despite this headwind, we still
achieved an 18% increase in earnings per share.

Going forward, we expect the pro forma tax rate for the
remainder of the year to be similar to our second quarter tax rate, resulting
in an estimated rate for the full year that is still in the 22% to 23% range of
our original guidance.

Our EPS guidance excludes any potential adjustments to the
charge we recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 relating to the U.S. tax
legislation as well as separation cost associated with the 2 spinoffs.

In the second quarter, we incurred $346 million or $0.46 of
separation cost, $291 million of which were tax costs incurred in the
restructuring of the ownership of various legal entities in preparation for the
spinoffs. Separation costs to date are in line with our expectations.

Other items composed of adjustments to the fourth quarter
U.S. tax legislation charge were a $0.02 benefit to EPS. So netting out the 2
items resulted in a $0.44 change in reported range per share to $1.68.

Let's turn to Slide 6. Our Aerospace business is performing
well in an extremely robust demand environment. Air Transport and Regional
flight hours were up 7%. And as you know, the backlogs of our major OEM
customers are at record levels. Despite the challenge that this level of demand
creates for our supply chain, Aerospace sales were up 8% on an organic basis.
We had 14% organic growth in defense and space with higher spares volumes on
U.S. Department of Defense programs, strong demand for sensors and guidance
systems and robust shipment volumes on key programs, including the F-35.

And in commercial OE, sales were up 7% organically, driven
by robust HTF engine demand in business aviation; air transport deliveries on
key narrow-body platforms, including the 737 and the A320; and lower customer
incentives, which added 1 point of organic growth to Aerospace in total in the
quarter.

Organic growth in the aftermarket of 4% was driven by
maintenance service program activity in business aviation and strong airlines
demand. In addition, our connected aircraft software offerings have grown more
than 15% year-to-date, driven by demand for our GoDirect cabin software.

In Transportation Systems, sales were up 7% organically on a
continued growth in passenger vehicle; gas turbos in China, Europe and South
Korea stemming from new launches; and higher commercial vehicle turbo volumes
in North America and China. Aerospace segment profit was up 12%. And segment
margin expanded 30 basis points, driven by higher sales volumes, commercial
excellence and lower year-over-year customer incentives. In the quarter, there
was a 30 basis point headwind from foreign currency, primarily in
Transportation Systems business.

In Home and Building Technologies, organic sales growth was
3% for the quarter. Homes grew 7%, driven by continued double-digit growth in
residential thermal solutions and strong thermostat demand in North America and
Europe. Similar to the first quarter, sales grew across all regions in ADI.

In buildings, organic sales were flat year-over-year. The
commercial fire business was strong in North America and Europe as well as our
Connected Buildings business, driven by demand for our Tridium building
management platform. In addition, activity in the high-growth regions within
Building Solutions was robust with double-digit organic sales growth in the quarter,
primarily in India. However, the overall buildings' organic growth was tempered
by slower bookings and revenue conversion in the North America energy vertical
in Building Solutions.

HBT segment margins expanded 60 basis points, driven by
commercial excellence, the benefits from previously funded and executed
restructuring and higher sales volumes.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were up 3%
on an organic basis, driven by growth in Process Solutions and UOP. Sales in
Process Solutions were up 5% organically, largely due to solid backlog
conversion in the project automation and solution business and significant
growth in the service business.

UOP sales were up 3% organically, driven by engineering and
catalyst growth, the latter being driven by new units in China and refining
catalyst reloads. The clients in gas processing and hydrogen from lower modular
gas equipment sales partly offset the growth in the rest of UOP. UOP backlog
was up 7% in the quarter, pointing to continued steady sales growth for the
second half.

In Advanced Materials, there was continued growth in
solstice low global warming products within Fluorine Products. However, this
was offset by lower volumes and a temporary unplanned plant shutdown in
specialty products.

PMT segment margins expanded 50 basis points, driven by
commercial excellence, benefits from previously funded and executed
restructuring and higher volumes, partly offset by inflation and a temporary
lower weighting of higher-margin sales within the catalyst and gas processing
businesses.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were up 11% on
an organic basis. We had another strong quarter in Intelligrated with continued
new projects activity in the e-commerce area. Intelligrated's orders growth
this quarter was again very strong, up more than 40%, adding to an already
robust project backlog. There is double-digit growth in productivity products,
driven by demand for new Android-based mobility product offerings, coupled with
strong growth in scanning and printing applications. The Android launches that
we've been previewing are gaining traction with our customers and winning
versus the competition in the marketplace.

Organic growth in the safety business was 5%, with strength
in the gas protection and high-risk product categories. Additionally, the SPS
China and India businesses each grew more than 20%. SPS generated impressive
margin expansion of 150 basis points, enabled by higher sales volumes,
commercial excellence and benefits from previously funded and executed
restructuring. We're extremely pleased with SPS performance this quarter.

Greg is now going to cover our outlook for the third quarter
and the rest of the year. But before he does, I want to reaffirm the confidence
I expressed in Greg when we announced in April that he's taking over as CFO of
Honeywell effective August 3. Greg and I have worked together since he joined
Honeywell in 2006. I can assure you that he has the business acumen, finance
acuity, determination and commitment required to excel as the CFO of Honeywell.
Working with him every day for the last 3 months on the transition has only
reinforced my confidence. I'm a shareowner, and I will sleep well with Greg at
the helm.

So over to you, Greg.

GREG LEWIS: Thank you very much, Tom. I appreciate the
confidence.

Let's move on to Slide 7, and I'd like to start by
discussing 2 important items as a backdrop to our forward look: tariffs and the
spins.

Let's start with tariffs. We're proactively managing both
the direct and the indirect impacts from the Section 232 and 301 tariffs. We've
evaluated and addressed the list of the first $50 billion of goods affected by
Section 301 as well as the retaliatory offsets and are currently assessing the
potential additional $200 billion of targeted tariffs. We have seen inflation
accelerate in a number of areas within the business, most notably in
transportation and logistics and in metals. And our procurement, marketing and
commercial excellence teams are proactively working on offsets to minimize the
impact to our P&L.

Based on the tariffs enacted to date and our mitigation
actions across the portfolio, we anticipate a minimal impact to our overall
business results in 2018. But this is a very dynamic situation that changes by
the day, as further evidenced by this morning's headlines, and we're giving it
substantial focus. We've established a robust set of processes in each of our
businesses and at the corporate level to ensure we stay on top of the
situation. For the known items, we are monitoring and rigorously addressing
cost increases to our supply chain and adjusting our pricing as necessary. I'm
encouraged by what our teams have accomplished so far.

Now for 2019, we're evaluating more structural solutions for
longer-term tariff impacts, including potentially bringing on new sources of
supply, where needed.

Now let's discuss our progress on our 2 spinoffs,
Transportation Systems and Homes. Both businesses are being operationalized,
and we're making great progress on building up the leadership teams for each.
Earlier this week, you saw the appointment of Carlos Cardoso as Chairman of the
Board of Transportation Systems, which will be called Garrett. We're pleased to
have a leader with such an impressive track record to strengthen an already
well-equipped global business leadership team led by Olivier Rabiller.

On the external side for both spins, we have filed the draft
Form 10s with the SEC and are working through the comment letter process for
each. We have completed rating agency presentations and are preparing for the
debt and equity roadshows for both companies. In short, we are on track for the
completions of both spins in 2018, and both businesses are performing well, as
you saw, and we look forward to updating you as the spin dates become clearer.

Lastly, just a reminder that both our quarterly EPS guidance
and our full year guidance includes earnings for both spin companies for the
full year and excludes separation costs related to those spins and any
adjustments to the tax charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related
to U.S. tax reform. We had a minor favorable adjustment to the charge in the
second quarter. These favorable adjustments may be larger in the second half of
the year, and we'll provide you with updates as we move forward.

Now let's move to Slide 8, and we'll discuss our outlook for
the third quarter. Overall, our strong order rates and a growing backlog are
expected to drive third quarter organic sales growth in the range of 5% to 7%.
Segment margins are expected to expand 30 to 50 basis points, driven by those
increased volumes, commercial excellence and material productivity, similar to
what we saw in the second quarter.

We anticipated third quarter earnings per share of $1.95 to
$2 or growth of 11% to 14% with a tax rate of approximately 22%.

Moving on to the businesses. In Aerospace, we expect
continued strength in commercial aviation, original equipment sales with higher
shipment volumes on the Boeing 737, the Embraer L450 and L500 and Dassault F8X
platforms. Used business jet inventories are at their lowest levels since
before the financial crisis. A number of new aircraft certifications will occur
in 2018, and we have good positions on the right platforms across the super
midsized and large business jet cabin aircraft.

In the aftermarket, we expect continued demand driven by
airline flight hours growth in ATR and maintenance service plan activity in
business aviation. We anticipate continued double-digit growth for the
connected aircraft, driven by demand for JetWave hardware and GoDirect
services.

In Defense & Space, we expect another strong quarter,
driven by demand for sensors and guidance systems in the U.S. and abroad and
spares volume into U.S. DoD and international defense programs.

Within transportation systems, we expect strong gas turbo
demand driven by new platform launches in Europe to continue.

In Home and Building Technologies, we expect strong demand
from our commercial fire and connected building technologies, but this will
largely be offset by the impact of declines in the energy backlog in Building
Solutions in the first half.

Within Homes, we anticipate continued growth in products,
driven by demand for thermostats and residential thermal solutions and
continued strength in ADI.

On Performance Materials and Technologies, we are
anticipating healthy growth in each of our businesses in the third quarter.

In Process Solutions, we expect continued backlog conversion
in the projects business and short-cycle demand in the software and life cycle
solutions and services businesses, driven by our strong first half short-cycle
orders growth.

In Advanced Materials, we expect continued strength from
customer adoption of our solstice low-global warming products and Fluorine
Products and better volumes in specialty products.

In UOP, we expect robust equipment, engineering and catalyst
demand with continued growth from new catalyst units in China. Based on the
timing and composition of those expected catalyst shipments in the second half,
we do expect that PMT margins will be down in the third quarter, but those
margin rates will significantly increase in the fourth quarter. Those
quarter-to-quarter dynamics are not unusual in this business, and I believe
we've talked about them before.

Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, we expect
continued outperformance in Intelligrated, driven by strong orders growth and
project backlog awarded in the first half of 2018.

In productivity products, we expect that our new mobility
product launches continue to gain momentum in the marketplace, building on a
strong second quarter.

In safety, we expect growth in all industrial safety
categories and continued growth in retail as we approach the holiday season.
China and India are each anticipated to have another quarter of double-digit
growth.

Now moving to Slide 9 to discuss our full year guidance. As
Darius mentioned, we've raised our full year sales, segment margin, earnings
per share and free cash flow guidance to reflect our strong performance in the
second quarter and confidence in our outlook for the second half of 2018. Our
revised guidance incorporates the minor impacts of the currently known tariffs.
We'll continue to monitor the plans to address the impacts, if any, from other
potential tariffs that have been announced but not yet enacted.

Full year organic sales are now expected to be up 5% to 6%.
This is driven by favorable conditions in our end markets, our emphasis on
organic growth initiatives like commercial excellence and continued penetration
at the high-growth regions, along with robust long cycle order rates and
backlogs. We've narrowed our segment margin guidance to 40 to 60 basis points,
the high end of our prior range, which reflects our strong first half and
confidence in strong sales volumes in the second half.

We significantly increased our free cash flow guidance to a
new range of $5.6 billion to $6.2 billion, driven by higher net income and
better working capital performance across the business, as you've seen in the
second quarter. This new range implies conversion of 92% to 100%, a strong
improvement from the 90% we posted in 2017. Our estimates for the full year
effective tax rate continue to be between 22% and 23%.

We have also raised our full year EPS guidance by $0.20 on
the low end and $0.10 in the high end, as Darius mentioned. This new range of
$8.05 to $8.15 represents earnings growth of 13% to 15%. Our guidance reflects
the revised weighted average share count of 754 million shares, which includes
the $1.7 billion in share repurchases in the first half and an estimate of the
repurchases planned for the remainder of 2018.

We anticipate this will provide a $0.03 benefit to EPS in
the second half of the year versus our previous guide.

On a segment level, we now expect Aerospace organic sales
growth to be 7% to 8% versus the previous guidance range of 3% to 5%, driven by
the continued recovery of the business aviation market and robust demand within
our defense business.

In Home and Building Technologies, we raised the low end of
our organic sales guidance by 1 point to 2% to 3% and the low end of our margin
guidance by 10 basis points to 30 to 50 basis points improvement. Our organic
growth and margin outlook for Performance Materials and Technologies has not
changed. However, we have updated the reported sales outlook to reflect the
headwinds and foreign currency translation in the second half of the year.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we have increased our
organic sales growth expectations to 7% to 8% versus the previous guidance
range of 4% to 6% and increased our segment margin guidance to a new range of
16.0% to 16.2%, up 90 to 110 basis points for the year. Safety and Productivity
Solutions had an outstanding second quarter, and our investments in the
Intelligrated business and the new Android-based product launches within
productivity products are delivering for us. Our revised outlook reflects
increased confidence that SPS will continue to deliver in the second half of
the year.

So let's wrap up on Slide 10. Honeywell delivered outstanding
operational performance in the second quarter with 6% organic sales growth, 60
basis points of margin expansion, 18% earnings growth and 42% free cash flow
growth. On top of our financial performance, we've continued to make
significant progress in becoming a software industrial leader. Our connected
offerings are helping our customers solve critical challenges across our large
installed base. We expect the momentum we have seen in the first half of the
year to continue within the second half. Our orders rates remain strong, and
our backlog continues to grow. Soon, we will spin off our Transportation
Systems and Homes businesses. We have made great progress to prepare both to
stand alone as independently publicly traded companies. We look forward to sharing
more on our continued strong performance with you as the year progresses.

And with that, let's move to Mark for Q&A.

MARK MACALUSO: Thanks, Greg. Darius, Tom and Greg are now
available to answer your questions. So Kathy, please open the line for Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is
coming from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE, VP & LEAD MULTI-INDUSTRY ANALYST,
GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Greg, welcome to the call. And Tom,
it's been great working with you the last 5 years. Wish you nothing but the
best in retirement.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Thanks, Joe.

GREG LEWIS: Thank you, Joe.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE: Maybe just starting off. Obviously,
organic growth has been really good the last 4 quarters. You're taking up the
organic growth guidance for the year. It's interesting to see that long-cycle
backlog continuing to grow at double digits as well. So maybe, Darius, just
touch on how much visibility do you already have going into 2019 on -- just
based on how good your long-cycle businesses are performing today?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, I mean, as you kind of think about
that 60-40 split that we talked about before, obviously, I'm gaining more
confidence by the day because that kind of backlog growth -- double-digit
backlog growth, double-digit growth in orders is tremendous. We're actually
very bullish also on the PMT segment kicking in much more significantly in the
second half based on the activity of our pipeline. So obviously, as I look
forward to 2019, although I'm still focused on 2018, we've got a couple
quarters to go, but there's no question that based on what we're seeing, we're
-- the things are shaping up nicely for another strong year in 2019 based on
current activity.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE: Yes, it seems like it. And it's
interesting to see you guys call out Amazon today. I think that was the first
time, at least, that I had heard their name mentioned. I'm just curious, like,
whether you're starting to deepen your relationship there and maybe just any
color around that specific project in Canada would be helpful.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Amazon has been a great customer. We've
had a long-term partnership. We're -- in some ways, we're a supplier and a
customer. So it kind of goes in both directions. The Intelligrated solutions
are extraordinarily well respected. And they hit the part of warehouse
automation that's growing the fastest, and that's around e-commerce. I've
talked about that before. That, that is truly the sweet spot of Intelligrated
offerings is in the high speed, high throughput. That's a solution that's
second to none, and we're seeing that being reflected in our growth rates. And
as I've said before on a number of calls, this will turn out to be the --
probably the best acquisitions we've ever done, and I continue to feel very
strongly about that.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE: Got it. Maybe if I could sneak one
more in. Look, you guys have been talking about this improvement in cash flow
now for a couple years and we're really, really starting to see the benefits of
it. Just curious whether there were any kind of onetime benefits that helped
you this quarter on the cash flow conversion and how you guys are thinking
about that now that you've raised your guidance for the year on the free cash
flow side?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No, I -- this is -- I'm glad you asked
that question, Joe, because that is -- to me, that's a real highlight of the
quarter. I mean, I really think that the kind of focus we've had within the
company on working capital, on terms, on executing on our inventory,
receivables, all those things are really kind of coming together and being
reflected. Our working capital turns are getting better. We're getting less --
driving less capital intensity. A lot of the investments we're paying that
we've made are paying off, and it's a really, really nice story. And it kind of
all came together here in Q2 cash flow, and we expect that momentum to
continue. So we feel good about what we're doing. We'll continue to add more
tools to HOS Gold to help our teams drive working capital, and it's really
gratifying to see a lot of that come through in the numbers. And we're not
done. We've got more tailwinds ahead of us so...

GREG LEWIS: Yes. Maybe I could just add to that. This has
been a 4-quarter story. I mean, we've got 4/10 of a turn improvement versus a
year ago but you're seeing sequentially each quarter that number continues to
get better. We've improved by about 1/10 of a turn in each of the most recent 4
quarters, so that is definitely a momentum shift with the efforts that have
been going on around the business.

OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Scott Davis of
Melius Research.

SCOTT REED DAVIS, FOUNDING PARTNER, CHAIRMAN, CEO &
RESEARCH ANALYST OF MULTI-INDUSTRY RESEARCH, MELIUS RESEARCH LLC: I'll share a
similar commentary. Tom, it's been a pleasure. You've had a great run and
deserve a lot of credit for following some big footsteps of Mr. Anderson. And
Greg, I'm sure you'll do a great as well. So it's been a pleasure.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Thanks, Scott.

GREG LEWIS: Thank you.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: There's just not been much to pick on with
you folks in a couple years, but the building side of the business is one that
I always kind of struggled to figure out what it is. It's a good business or
not a good business. But what do you think keeps the building owners from
spending money? I mean, they should be cash flowing pretty well right now. Why
aren't they investing more heavily? Do you guys have a sense to that?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think, frankly, it's a
little bit of -- we have to do an even better job of communicating the value of
our connected buildings. But as we talked about in some of our win examples,
when you secure a building like the Burj Khalifa, which is kind of the --
probably as prestigious a building as there is anywhere in the world and the
building owner sees the value in our connected building solutions, that tells
you something. So I think that there is more headway here for us. Frankly, also
in Q2, we had some operational issues on the electronic side. So this print
could have been a little bit better than it actually was. We're working through
our backlog situation that should correct itself in Q3 and Q4. But overall, we
feel pretty good about the kind of offerings we have. And I'd say something
else in the Connected Buildings. We're in different steps of evolution of all
our connected plays, whether it's connected aircraft, connected buildings,
plant and so on. I actually think that a lot of the solutions that we have in
connected buildings are more commercial-ready than maybe a lot of the other
offerings that we have. So we've installed a new leader in HBT with a great
deal of confidence, and Vim always has a tremendous track record in process
solutions. And we're very confident he's going to do the same in HBT.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Okay. Just as a quick follow-up, guys. The
-- what percentage of revenues do you think are connected now? So I know you
have got a big potential for connectivity, but is it -- is it something you can
really measure at this juncture?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Think about -- yes, it's north of $1.5
billion that's purely the connected revenues. That's not the total software
business, just to be clear.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Yes, understood. And I imagine that's
strong free cash flow as well probably, right?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Absolutely.

OPERATOR: We will now move to Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Congrats to Greg. Tom, thanks for all your help. Congrats also on a
great run.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Thank you, Steve.

GREG LEWIS: Thanks, Steve.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: And Darius, I think you can shorten
the intro on Intelligrated and just say Amazon, and I think people will be pretty
happy with that. So just some advice there. Anyway, just kidding around. So I
think Scott took care of most of the nitpicking here. On free cash flow, again,
kind of this year, the progress you've made, would you expect to kind of
continue to see progress into 2019? I mean, are these the types of things that,
with the business mix and with what you're doing, that you can kind of grow
that again a little bit faster perhaps than earnings whatever ever earnings may
grow in 2019 as well?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Absolutely, Steve. I mean, I think this
is -- if you go back to that playbook, and I'll say the playbook really came
out all the way in Investor Day of 2016. When you think about all the factors
that I talked about, right, which is accelerating our organic growth rate,
continued margin enhancement, improved cash conversion, transforming to a
software industrial and deploying -- be more aggressive around capital
deployment, I think we could put all those things together, we can point clear
signs to every one of those things that we're doing. And obviously, cash
conversion was one of those elements. We committed to be in the 90s this year.
I feel even more confident of us being there, and I continue to be bullish
about us making progress in '19 and beyond.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: And then you guys, I believe, you
bought back another $700 million worth of stock this quarter. And it's a little
bit kind of late in the year for M&A, at least to close. So there would
seem to be a decent amount of cash that's kind of left over when you think
about the kind of annual run rate of potential. Is that the kind of fair way to
look at it? That if we get through another quarter here, we'll be pretty
consistent on this buyback phase? Or are you more or less bullish about kind of
the acquisition pipeline here?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No, we're -- I'm -- I have, by no means,
given up on getting an acquisition closed this year. I think we still have a
shot to do so. We're looking at a number of things. You never know which way
they're going to go. I mean, so far, a lot of them have gone left rather than
right for one reason or another, but we're far from giving up and getting a
decent acquisition done here or maybe even a couple. But the calculus has
always been, okay, if we can't deploy capital through acquisitions, bolt-ons,
which has always been our preference, then we're going to deploy back in the
form of buybacks. And I thought it was a very attractive entry point as I
talked about it at the end of Q1 in the $140. So I was more than happy to buy
back the shares.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: And how much -- if you didn't know
deals from here on out, how much would you be able to buy back this year?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, I mean, we've got a lot -- it's --
we've got a lot of cash on the balance sheet, but I'm not planning on spending
all of it so...

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: We talked about, at the beginning of the
year, of having capital deployed of $5 billion to $6 billion in total for the
full year. And that's available capital. That's not -- we're not committed to
like spending every single dollar of that. But it just gives you a sense that,
that's healthy. And with a better free cash flow, I think we'll have more
opportunity.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, I mean, the framework I think that
I provided, Steve, just to be consistent, and I'd still stick with it, which is
if you think about a dividend someplace around the $3 billion mark for the 2
spins, I'm going to have to use some of that to pay down debt, something in the
$1 billion to $2 billion range. The rest of that I'm committing to buybacks. So
I'm kind of done that already. On top of that, I would do what I need to do to
keep share count flat, which is another half or so. And then on top of that, we
might do a little bit more. So that's kind of a rough framework. And it's a
little bit -- the calculus gets a little fuzzy depending upon whether or not we
do have a transaction. It's going to be a little bit less if we do another
transaction. It might be a bit more if we don't. So -- and also, we'll see
where the entry points are.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: No, it's clear. Having more cabbage is
better than not having any cabbage. That's very clear.

OPERATOR: We'll now go to Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, VERTICAL
RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: The -- I just want to again come back to cash flow. And
Darius, as you're probably well aware, actually, your conversion is a lot
better than it looks to the naked eye, right, given the amount of noncash
pension income there is here. So now that we're kind of -- yes, no, it's
extraordinary. And so now that we're kind of approaching a level where cash
flow per share is kind of in line with your EPS guidance per se, what do you
think about maybe trying to do something on pension and kind of taking that out
of the equation here? I don't know if you can extract value from it or not.
Obviously, it's in great financial shape but just -- I'd love to hear your
thoughts on that.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, yes, I mean, obviously,
that's something we thought about. We've derisked half of it, so half of that
exposure is gone. Our pension is funded at like 113%, 114% range. So even if
you think about some kind of a major step back in terms of the market at 20%
reduction, we'd still be fully funded. So do we -- there is some benefit to
having some below-the-line income as well come through. It does hurt cash
conversion, but there are some benefits as well. So obviously, we're thinking
about that. No further decisions will be made. But I thought taking at least
half that risk completely off the table like we did earlier this year was wise,
particularly given were the markets were, and we'll see what we do from here.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: And then separately, just if we can,
can we put a finer point on spin timing? Do you think Turbo can still be a Q3
event? Or is there a little bit of an implicit slippage? And just your
commentary here about both being a second half event.

GREG LEWIS: Yes, no slippage. We are going according to plan.
I think we talked about the end of the third quarter for turbo, and that is
well aligned with our current thinking. Homes is also coming right behind it.
We're very much in the throes of the preparations there as well, so nothing
different. I think we feel pretty good about the things that we can control.
And obviously, with the SEC process, that one is a bit out of our hands, but
it's going well.

OPERATOR: And we now move to Julian Mitchell of Barclays.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Thanks to Tom and welcome to Greg. Maybe just first question
about Aerospace. Just wondered how long you thought it was sustainable for
Defense & Space to keep outgrowing commercial aftermarket by such a
distance. And also, I guess, in commercial aftermarket, should we expect some
recovery there or acceleration over the next 12 months given the favorable
macro?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. On Defense & Space, they
continue to be bullish given what we're seeing in the -- not just the U.S.
defense budgets that's certainly positive, but also a lot of the NATO
countries' defense budgets. And they -- I don't know if they're all going to
reach the 2% of GDP level, but it's very clear that many of them are going up.
So that's -- that continues to be -- continue to be bullish on that segment. In
terms of kind of the aftermarket part of our business, I think a couple of
things to point out. One is we're shifting more of that mix to longer-term
contracts. So I discussed this a little bit at the end of Q1. So we're going to
see a little bit more of kind of steady-state rather than kind of complete
alignment with flight hours. We still feel good about what we did. Two is we
have a little bit more of an avionics versus mechanical focus versus some of
the others, which probably see greater -- even higher correlation to flight
hours. And three is we are still very much in kind of a past due situation on
the backlog. I mean, we are seeing some challenges in kind of the Tier 3, Tier
4 supply chains. And frankly, these numbers could have been even better, and
we're working through those to -- and we expect to really be in a much, much
better shape by the end of the year. But nevertheless, things are a bit too
strained on the supply chain and I think that's very consistent with what
you're hearing from a lot of the other aerospace players as well.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. I would add that I think that we're
going to be fine on the aftermarket, but it is tough to compete with the
defense backlog. I mean, you saw the growth rates in the quarter, and the
backlog is up well into the double digits. So when does that stop, nobody
really knows. But right now, for the foreseeable future, that is very strong
backlog to work from as well. So you have both of them going in the right
direction.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL: And then my second question would be
switching to Safety and Productivity. So obviously, very good growth in
productivity within that. My assumption would have been that a lot of that was
fueled by large projects, businesses like Intelligrated, that might carry a
lower margin. So I'm intrigued, I guess, by the extent of the margin uplift in
the guide at SPS. So maybe give any color, I guess, around what's going on in
that margin guidance uplift. And are you seeing much better margins on large
projects perhaps that you might have done historically?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, a couple of comments. I think
certainly, we're seeing better margins there in Intelligrated. But the other
thing, let's not forget that, it's been a -- it's a really nice story in SPS
throughout all our businesses, granted Intelligrated grew faster than a number
of the others. But if you, let's say, look productivity products, which really
had a really nice quarter this quarter, double-digit growth, substantial margin
expansion, and this is very consistent. If you go back to a lot of the earnings
call last year, I talked about us getting that business back on track. And I'm
very pleased to see that John and the team really kind of got that business
going again. It was a tremendous story. Our SIoT business had another strong
quarter. So it's -- the kind of margin expansion growth we're seeing in SPS is
just -- it's not just limited to Intelligrated. It's really across the board.
There isn't a single business that didn't have a good quarter in SPS.

GREG LEWIS: Yes. And if I could just add, I mean, there is a
lot of self-help in the businesses that we had. And if you remember part of the
Intelligrated thesis is we have other businesses with that business model and
part of the integration benefits is some of those practices coming over from
the HPS projects business, as an example, to the Intelligrated projects
business so that we'll run that more efficiently. And they're starting to adopt
some of those things as well. So that's part of the expectation of what we had
laid out when we bought the business also, was to be able to help it run itself
on a much more efficient basis as part of Honeywell.

OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Deane Dray of RBC
Capital markets.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: Add my congrats to Tom and Greg.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Thanks, Deane.

GREG LEWIS: Thank you.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: I know this is under the category of high-quality
problem. But when I hear Intelligrated orders up 40%, it just raises concerns
about whether you're -- might be taking on too much, your potential risk of
overpromising, underdelivering and maybe your pricing is not appropriate if
you're seeing that kind of order surge. So just kind of talk us through that. I
know it's a high-quality problem, but just take us through what the
implications of such rapid growth.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. Well, let's start with the pricing
because it's a couple of different questions. I mean, I would tell you that
Intelligrated margins are expansion -- are expanding, not contracting. A lot of
that is due to self-help. We're becoming much more efficient. We're leveraging
a much broader global footprint to complete the work. And frankly, this is a
technology business. When you can process 400 boxes a minute versus 350,
customers are willing to pay for that. And I would say that right now, and it's
just going to continue to stay this way. This is the best technology available
in the marketplace, so it's pretty clearly to see why we are where we are. In
terms of the -- that kind of growth, 40%, that's -- it's not surprising to us.
We've known that this was coming. We continue to be very bullish about a lot
more growth. So you guys should expect kind of double-digit orders growth here
in the second half as well. And we've been preparing for it. We're building out
capacity, capability and we're staffing up very, very quickly. We're
exceptional at project execution. That's also why we win as often as we do. And
frankly, the Intelligrated team is using a lot of the HOS Gold toolkit to
continue to execute and also leveraging a lot of the things that were done in
Honeywell Process Solutions because the leader now of Intelligrated is somebody
who was a leader in HPS. So all those things are kind of coming together, and I
feel very bullish on our ability to be able to process that backlog
successfully.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: Good to hear. And just a separate
question for Tom and/or Greg. Is the idea on tax reform is there might have
been some -- it might be some simplification opportunities in your tax
structure? We talked about that before. Is any of that beginning to come
through? And maybe at all, it's -- you can't tell yet with the work you're
doing on the spins and the separation of legal entities, but just what your
line of sight on the simplification of your tax structure and some cost savings
that might fall through.

GREG LEWIS: Yes, great. That's a great question. We are
working through that real time, as you can imagine. And as you alluded to, the
spins do play a role in creating some of that clarity. So that as we get closer
to the spins, we'll have a better view on exactly what those impacts will be.
But we are working on exactly that as we speak. And as alluded to in the
outlook, I think in the second half of the year, as that does become much
clearer, we'll be able to give you some more specifics about what that impact
will be. But for certain, we will have a more simplified structure as we go
forward and adapt to the new tax legislation.

OPERATOR: The next question will come from Andrew Obin of
Bank of America.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN, MD, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Just a question. We're getting a lot of questions from investors on
potential for global slowdown, and I'm just trying to reconcile this with
accelerated organic growth and Honeywell into second half of '19. Could you
just take us around the world and just describe what you're seeing in your key
geographies? Are you seeing any slowdown anywhere?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No. I mean, I think yes and no. China,
for example, last year, our growth was in the 20s. Currently, we see it a
little bit more kind of in the teens, but I wouldn't exactly call that a
slowdown. I mean, maybe relatively speaking, it's a slowdown. India continues
to be double-digit growth. LatAm was strong. Central Europe was strong. When I
say strong, all double-digit kind of growth kind of figure. So overall, we're
not seeing much of a slowdown. Now you couple all that with our backlog growth,
our long-cycle order growth, you couple it with some of the past due situations
we have in Aerospace, right now, I'm continuing to be bullish overall on the
growth. So based on what we're seeing right now, based on the orders, long
cycle, short cycle that we're seeing, there's every reason for me to continue
to be bullish on our growth. Could that change? Of course, but I'm not seeing
it right now.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: And just a follow-up on Aerospace. As
we're thinking about the defense part of the business, is it just fair just to
look at modernization authority growth? Or are there some specific programs
that are driving this accelerated growth?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No. I mean, it's -- yes, it's really
both because, as you know, our defense business in Aerospace is really so
widespread. So it's not really tied to any one given program. And whether it's
tanks, aircraft, all those will drive the right financial outcomes for us. And
it's widespread both in the U.S. and the international arena. So it's -- as the
defense budgets grow, so will our business, and we're seeing that.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: But that implies, if you look at
modernization authority, it should grow like high single digits for a while. So
the business should keep up with that?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, we -- by the way, we've
also expanded some capacity in Aerospace just to -- especially in the area of
industrials and so on. So we've got capacity expansion that's already taking
place to keep up with that demand. And frankly, we knew that a lot of the air
transport market was going to take off. We've adjusted to that. Now we're
trying to pull the supply chain -- kind of the Tier 2, Tier 3 supply chain
along with that to make sure that they can keep up, and there's been a lot of
energy spent on us working with our suppliers to make sure that they're ready
for what we believe is the new normal.

OPERATOR: And our final question will come from Steven
Winoker of UBS.

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER, MD & INDUSTRIALS ANALYST, UBS
INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Tom, congratulations for more than just
this role. I think it's been, what, 12 years since our days at ACS? It's been a
long run.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. You're an insider still, Steve.

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER: Yes. Well, I never quite leave. I try
to. You guys make me sound like a broken record on these quarters now. And the
cash, particularly great to see that traction so quickly all. So I know that's
hard. A couple questions here. One around -- nobody I think has gone into some
detail on the Q&A on PMT and HPS maybe particularly, some of the dynamics
there, obviously, of tough comps in advanced materials. We have oil moving
steadily. So can you maybe talk about some of the dynamics and what's the potential
for acceleration in HPS and UOP at least?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, HPS performed very, very
well in the second quarter. It's up mid-single digit for the first half of the
year. It's a business that's been on an absolute tear for a long time now. Our
order rates are strong. We're actually even more bullish in the second half of
the year. As you know, it now contains the Smart Energy business, which we
moved in there, which is also gaining acceleration, and that is part of that
management team. So overall, we're very bullish on continued HPS performance.
And overall, between HPS and UOP, kind of our quote log looks very strong for
the second half, and we expect to convert a lot of that to orders. So overall,
I'm very pleased with what we're seeing in PMT.

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER: And by the way, Darius, what is the
margin rate impact these days of an implication of HPS growth? Because I know
you've moved up so much over the years.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Can you say that again, Steve?

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER: So just in terms of HPS impact on --
and PMT segment margin as it's now growing more quickly than the rest of the
segments.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: It is in line with overall PMT margin
rates. Maybe a little bit south, but it's -- it isn't accretive or dilutive materially.

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER: Okay. And do you still see margin
expansion opportunity in that subsegment?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: For sure. Yes, absolutely. Especially, I
think the team is doing a tremendous job and further driving productivity in
Smart Energy. I mean, they -- the HPS team really knows how to drive
productivity well. The Smart Energy business, frankly, has an opportunity to do
a lot of that. It's a projects business, (inaudible) business, both areas that
are very, very comfortable for HPS. And as you know, in the second half of last
year, they had taken the business on and are already seeing progress, and there
is much more to come. So they're far from done in terms of margin expansion in
HPS.

GREG LEWIS: Yes. It's one of our more mature, I'd say,
connected enterprises in terms of that software offering so we absolutely have
a nice tailwind there on margins.

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER: Okay. And just lastly on Page 7, that's
really helpful in terms of the tariff inflation comment. But we're hearing a
lot about pricing from other companies. How much of your offset is a really
pricing action playing into this? Or are there really just a lot of other
things going on?

GREG LEWIS: Yes. We're doing a mix of both pricing and some
sourcing changes as well as we're benefiting from having locked in some
purchases earlier in the year. So of our mitigations, I would say it's probably
2/3, 1/3 in terms of pricing versus our sourcing actions. But so far, we've had
success passing through where appropriate. And as I discussed, we're -- this
thing changes by the day, and this is -- in fact, this is a weekly cadence we
have going on across the entire enterprise. So not much grass is growing under
our feet as this is changing.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. Just to add to that, I think the key
here is to get ahead of it early, and I think we definitely have. And then we
haven't lost focus. This is literally a weekly activity for us and probably the
single most important thing that we talk about in making sure that we're proactive.
We're being ahead of here because if you sit and wait, you could see
substantial margin contraction. So we're doing a good job managing, but there's
still a lot of unknowns here we don't know that we're planning for.

GREG LEWIS: Yes. And we're -- I mean, we're benefiting from
the fact that we do have a lot of local-for-local business constructs, so
that's been helpful to us. And in fact, there's going to be some places where
us sourcing from non-China sources are going to be competitively helpful where
others are sourcing from China. So it's a complex equation. There's obviously
the sourcing challenges, but there are also some places where it could be
competitively advantageous to us as well. So we're trying to make a good
balance.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: And just to highlight that point that
Greg just made, which is we have a structure, for the most part, not perfectly,
but we're kind of regionally hub-oriented. So we have kind of a local-for-local
sourcing, engineering, marketing supply chain base. So we're -- I wouldn't tell
you we're not impacted, but we're a lot more prepared because of our global
footprint and how we operate the business.

OPERATOR: And this does conclude today's question-and-answer
session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius
Adamczyk for any additional closing remarks.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Thank you. I have full confidence that
the strong performance we delivered for our shareowners in the first and second
quarters will continue throughout the rest of the year. Our order rates are
strong, our backlogs are growing, and we're realizing the benefits from our
continued efforts to drive software and connected growth, productivity,
commercial excellence and improve free cash flow. Honeywell is well positioned
to continue to deliver, and I hope that is evident in both the second quarter
performance and the commitments we made to you today.

Before we end, I want to take a minute to thank Tom Szlosek
for all his contributions to the company. Tom has gracefully navigated the
businesses and the finance organization through some pretty significant changes
and challenges over the past 4 years. It has been a pleasure to have Tom on my
staff and at the company for the past 14 years and wish him all the best in the
future. Congratulations on a successful career, Tom.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Thank you.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: On behalf of the entire Honeywell team,
I wish you a pleasant rest of the summer. Thank you.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Great.

OPERATOR: Thank you. This does conclude today's
teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful
day.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to
Honeywell's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As
a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to
introduce your host for today's call, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor
Relations.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.:
Thanks, Kathy. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's First Quarter 2018
Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are President and CEO, Darius
Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek.

This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP
reconciliations, are available on our website at 

. Note that elements of this
presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view
of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can
change, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the
principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our annual
report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.

For this call, references to earnings per share, free cash
flow and effective tax rate exclude impacts from separation costs related to
the upcoming spinoff of our Homes and Transportation Systems business, along
with recent tax legislation. This morning, we'll review our financial results
for the first quarter of 2018, share our guidance for the second quarter and
provide an update to our 2018 outlook. And as always, we'll leave time for your
questions at the end.

So with that, let me turn the call over to President and
CEO, Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK, PRESIDENT, CEO & CHAIRMAN OF THE
BOARD, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning,
everyone. Honeywell had a very strong start to 2018 with first quarter earnings
per share of $1.95, up 14% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our
guidance range by $0.02. Our earnings this quarter were driven by organic sales
growth of 5%.

The growth was strong across the portfolio, particularly in
Aerospace, SPS warehouse automation and the PMT process automation businesses.
We expect this momentum to continue throughout the year. Our long-cycle orders
were up 35% and our long-cycle backlog was up double digits with particular
strength in Intelligrated, Aerospace and UOP. I will touch on our revised full
year guidance in a minute.

Operational performance was also strong as evidenced by the
40 basis points of margin expansion and nearly 30% growth in free cash flow. We
benefited from our continued investments in Commercial Excellence, together
with material productivity and volume leverage. The margin expansion was within
our guide and in line with our long-term target of 30 to 50 basis points
expansion per year.

Free cash flow in the quarter was about $1 billion. The 30%
growth follows an exceptionally strong first quarter of 2017, where free cash
flow was up more than 500%, so the cash performance is even more noteworthy.
And yet we believe there's even more improvement ahead, driven by our
company-wide initiative on cash and working capital.

Finally, on Q1, we continued to aggressively deploy capital,
repurchasing nearly $950 million in Honeywell shares. We are also tracking well
with the cash repatriation plan we reviewed at our Investor Day in February,
which contemplated more than $4 billion of cash being repatriated in 2018.

Today, we're raising our full year 2018 organic sales growth
guidance to a new range of 3% to 5%, our EPS guidance to a new range of $7.85
to $8.05 and our free cash flow guidance by $100 million. Compared to prior
range, our EPS guidance is now $0.10 higher at the low end and $0.05 higher at
the high end. These changes reflect both our exceptional first quarter
performance and our confidence in our company's ability to continue
outperforming for the remainder of 2018.

Our end markets are strong. We are experiencing robust
commercial activity. We are executing well as evidenced by our margin and cash
performance. And we have significant balance sheet capacity to deploy. In
summary, an exciting start to what we expect to be a very strong year.

Let's turn to Slide 3 to highlight some of the recent news
from our businesses. In Aerospace, we signed 3 contracts with Singapore
Airlines Group to provide the latest Honeywell technologies and solutions to
help improve operational capabilities for Singapore Airlines, SilkAir and
Scoot. The agreements include a variety of services and equipment, including
weather radar, navigation systems, auxiliary power units, predictive
maintenance technologies and a 24/7 engineering and maintenance support.

Additionally, Singapore Airlines Group and Honeywell signed
a memorandum of understanding to jointly work to implement Honeywell's
Connected Aircraft technologies to reduce operational risk, improve efficiency
and maximize aircraft performance. As a result of the agreement, the family of
airlines will receive better and more predictive maintenance services that will
reduce mechanical delays and cancellations. And through connectivity and
analytics, flying will be more efficient and cost-effective. We are seeing
significant demand from our customers for Connected Aircraft offerings. And we
continue to lead the industry when it comes to innovation in this area.

In Home and Building Technologies, we launched the INNCOM e7
thermostat for hotels, a new Connected Building offering. This is the first
enterprise-grade environmental control and energy management solution that
incorporates Amazon's Alexa voice control for temperature, lighting, drapery
and amenity functions. Honeywell's INNCOM hospitality solutions are used in
more than 1.5 million guest rooms around the world.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, we introduced a
cloud-based simulation tool that uses a combination of augmented reality and
virtual reality to train plant personnel on critical industrial work
activities. With more than 50% of the oil and gas workforce due to retire
within the next 5 years, the Honeywell Connected Plant's Skills Insight
Immersive Competency tool is designed to bring new industrial workers up to
speed quickly by enhancing training and delivering it in new and contemporary
ways. An upstream oil and gas customer in Europe is already using this solution
to improve the productivity and skill set of its employees.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we launched the
Dolphin CN80 ultra-rugged handheld computer for demanding environments, such as
distribution centers and parcel delivery. The CN80 is the latest device to run
our Honeywell's Android-based Mobility Edge Platform, which is composed of
common software and hardware architecture and a suite of device tools. The
scalable architecture allows customers to develop, test and certify an
application just once before deploying it to multiple device types across the
enterprise, allowing companies to accelerate deployments, optimize device
performance and extend the total product life cycle with the objective of
lowering the total cost of ownership.

We launched the first Mobility Edge device late last year,
the Dolphin CT60 for transportation logistics and direct store delivery. And we
will launch 2 additional Mobility Edge devices for a variety of markets later
this year. There has been significant demand for our Android-based products.
And we expect to see the impact of our new launches in our second quarter
results.

The final highlight is a new environmental commitment we
made in China to reduce China-specific greenhouse gas emissions for our
facilities by 10% per $1 of revenue from 2016 levels by 2022. We have
voluntarily implemented more than 100 energy efficiency projects at our sites
in China since 2011. Globally, we have reduced Honeywell's greenhouse gas
intensity by more than 65% between 2004 and 2017. Our increased -- and
increased our energy efficiency by 60% in the same time frame. By 2019, we'll
reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 10% per $1 of
revenue from our 2013 levels.

Since 2010, we have implemented more than 3,600 energy
efficiency and water conservation projects. We are proud of our environmental,
social and governance track record and are committed to continued excellence in
this area.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will
discuss our results in more detail.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK, SENIOR VP & CFO, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thanks, Darius. Good morning. I'm on Slide 4. As Darius
mentioned, we had a very strong start to 2018: reported sales, up 9%; organic
sales, up 5% in the quarter. The markets we serve generally are strong, but our
continued organic sales growth also reflects our strong market positions and
the investments we've made in the sales organization and in new product
introductions. The difference between reported and organic sales is primarily
the impact of foreign currency translation, mainly related to the euro.

Segment profit was up 12% in the quarter and segment margin
expanded by 40 basis points to 19.2%, primarily due to the benefits from
material productivity, Commercial Excellence, volume leverage on higher sales
and benefits from previously funded and completed restructuring projects.
Earnings per share, $1.95, up 14%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range
by $0.02. This excludes spin-related separation cost of about $55 million in
the quarter. We'll walk through the details of our EPS performance in a second.

Free cash flow in the quarter of $1 billion was up 30%,
driven by strong operational performance, particularly in HBT and Safety and
Productivity Solutions. As Darius mentioned, we're still in the early stages of
our working capital initiatives. But we're encouraged by our progress and by
the additional opportunities that are emerging from the enterprise-wide focus
we have in this area.

We continue to deploy capital, and in the quarter,
repurchased nearly $950 million worth of Honeywell shares. After growth
investments and paying a competitive dividend, our preference is to deploy
capital to M&A. But in the absence of immediate opportunities, we'll
continue to opportunistically repurchase outstanding shares. Q1 certainly
presented ample buying opportunities, given the pricing level and our general
positive outlook on the growth of the company. So overall, we're pleased with
the start to the year with robust sales growth and high-quality earnings.

Slide 5 walks our earnings per share from the first quarter
of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018. The preponderance of our earnings growth,
$0.21, came from segment profit improvement, driven by enhanced sales growth
across the company, the impacts from our Commercial Excellence efforts,
productivity improvements realized through HOS Gold and savings from previously
funded and completed restructuring projects. Below-the-line items were a $0.03 tailwind
this quarter, primarily due to higher pension income, reflective of strong
performance of the assets in our pension plan and lower discount rate.

As a reminder, our U.S. pension plan is approximately 110%
funded. And we announced in February that we modified the asset allocation in
our funds, shifting our plan assets to comprise about 50% fixed income-type
investments, up from 20% previously. This change will not affect 2018 pension
income. We do expect a reduction to 2019 pension income but anticipate being
able to overcome the impact due to our profit growth prospects. Therefore, this
is not expected to be an EPS headwind for 2019.

Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.6% versus 22.7%
in the first quarter of '17. Our estimated rate for the full year remains in
the 22% to 23% range. And most of the tailwinds coming from the tax reform
legislation will be in the second half of 2018.

In February, I spoke about how the recent U.S. tax reform
would impact Honeywell. The $3.8 billion provisional charge we recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2017 is still subject to revision throughout the course of
2018. But there was no adjustment to that amount in the first quarter. We still
expect to repatriate approximately $7 billion of overseas cash by the end of
2019 with at least $4 billion of that coming in 2018, as Darius said earlier.

There continues to be a regular flow of guidance and
clarification in this area, which could result in changes to the provisional
charge, the effective rate and the timing of the repatriation. We'll continue
to update you on any material changes that arise. To close out the walk, other
items, including the lower share count from our share repurchase activity and
noncontrolling interest, were a $0.02 benefit versus the first quarter of 2017.

Let's turn to Slide 6. As you'll recall, we changed the HBT
organization structure to segregate the Homes business from the rest of the
portfolio that will remain with Honeywell after the spinoff. Buildings is
roughly a $5.3 billion business, so just over half of the HBT portfolio, and
includes building products, like fire controls, commercial security and air and
water filtration products.

Connected Buildings includes our controls and integrated
software for commercial HVAC and building management. Building Solutions
includes our integrated hardware, software, installation and service offerings
for more complex buildings and structures.

Homes is roughly a $4.5 billion business that comprises
Comfort and Care, including our residential thermostats and HVAC controls;
safety and security, which includes the residential components of our former
security business; and distribution, which is the global ADI business. You'll
see the sales from the Homes and Building businesses separately presented in our
filings beginning this quarter.

Let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our segment results for the
quarter. Beginning with Aerospace, sales were up 8% on an organic basis, led by
Commercial OE, where growth in both air transport and business aviation was
nearly double digit, driven by robust deliveries on key platforms, including
the A320, Boeing 737 and Bombardier Challenger 350. We're on winning platforms
and continue to expand our installed base. We expect the OE growth and
installed base to continue as our long-cycle backlog in the OE business is up
more than 15%. As Tim mentioned at our Investor Day in February, we're
beginning to see the business aviation OE market recover. Our winning positions
across engines, APUs and avionics will benefit us in the anticipated upturn.

In defense, we achieved close to 20% growth in U.S. defense,
driven by higher sensors and guidance systems and engines demand and sales of
engines and avionics spares into Army and Navy programs. Transportation Systems
grew 7% organically, driven by demand for light vehicle gas and commercial
vehicle turbos, particularly in North America and in China. Organic growth in
Commercial Aftermarket of 4% was driven primarily by strong R&O demand and
another quarter of double-digit growth for our JetWave satellite communications
hardware, partially offset by delayed spares shipments. For the full year, we
expect aftermarket organic sales growth in the low to mid-single-digits range.

Aerospace sales were up 12% on a reported basis with the
difference between the organic sales growth resulting from foreign exchange
fluctuations, which was a 3 point impact, and the adoption of the new revenue
recognition accounting standard, which was a 1 point impact. We anticipate that
the revenue recognition impact will be immaterial for the full year. Aerospace
segment profit was up 12% and segment margin expanded 10 basis points.

We continue to see the benefits from the Honeywell
initiatives to drive productivity and Commercial Excellence. And we incurred
slightly lower customer incentives. But this was largely offset by higher
volumes of lower-margin OE shipments, inflation and foreign exchange. It's also
noteworthy we expanded margins 90 basis points in the first quarter of 2017,
generating significant productivity and repositioning benefits on flat organic
sales. We're pleased with the installed base growth in Aerospace, resulting
from the pickup in OEM volumes and expect that margin expansion will improve
sequentially throughout the year.

In Home and Building Technologies, organic sales growth was
2% for the quarter. Homes grew 6% driven by double-digit growth in residential
thermal solutions and robust demand for thermostats in North America. Sales
grew across all regions in ADI, driven by Commercial Excellence, new product
introductions and demand in India and in Europe.

In the buildings business, organic sales growth was flat
year-over-year. The legacy Building Solutions business grew 4%, driven by
backlog conversion in the energy vertical and strong demand in High Growth
Regions but was partially offset in buildings products as a result of lower
seasonal demand for air and water products in China and some temporary supply
chain challenges within the buildings products business. HBT segment margins
expanded 50 basis points, driven by Commercial Excellence, the benefits from
previously funded and completed restructuring and material productivity.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were up 3%
on an organic basis, driven by growth in Process Solutions and in UOP. Sales in
HPS were up 4% organically with solid growth globally in thermal solutions and
strong demand for gas and electricity meters in EMEA. Short-cycle demand was
also strong in the HPS aftermarket and field instrumentation businesses. UOP sales
were up 3%, driven by robust engineering and catalyst growth in both refining
and petrochemicals, the latter being driven by new units in China.

In Advanced Materials, continued customer adoption of our
broad range of Solstice low global warming products drove growth. The strong
orders growth throughout PMT and the UOP long-cycle backlog growth is fueling
our expectations for continued PMT sales growth.

PMT segment margin was flat year-over-year. Benefits from
previously funded restructuring, productivity net of inflation and Commercial
Excellence were offset by unfavorable mix, the timing of catalyst shipments at
the end of the quarter in UOP and in foreign exchange.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were up 6% on an
organic basis, primarily driven by double-digit sales growth at Intelligrated
for major new systems. Orders growth in Intelligrated this quarter was
extraordinary and contributed to the long-cycle backlog improvement I mentioned
earlier. SPS also experienced higher volumes in sensing and scanning products
with strong demand in India and China.

We were encouraged by the orders momentum stemming from the
launch of our first Mobility Edge Android product offering. We expect to see an
improvement in mobility sales in subsequent quarters as the remainder of the
Mobility Edge products that Darius mentioned earlier are launched. Similar to
the fourth quarter, the robust volume growth and ongoing productivity efforts
in SPS enabled 130 basis points of segment margin expansion.

Before we get into our second quarter and full year outlook,
I wanted to provide some information on how the recently announced tariffs will
affect Honeywell as well as the proactive actions we're taking to address these
items. So I'm on Page 8. Regarding the Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs,
based on what has been enacted as of today, our exposure is relatively minimal,
less than $10 million of gross tariff impact. Our direct Tier 1 and indirect
Tier 2 spend in these categories across Honeywell is small and the imported
portion of that spend is even smaller. The more significant impact is the
secondary effect from the price inflation on non-imported steel and aluminum.
Here, we've put in place aggressive mitigation strategies that largely offset
any impact to Honeywell.

Regarding the China tariffs, this is clearly a fluid
situation. We continue to assess our exposure while also actively developing
mitigation plans. The proposed tariffs do not take effect until May. And the
U.S. and China intend to negotiate in the interim. We suspect this scope of
impacted products and tariffs is likely to change. But we'll be prepared either
way and update you as we learn more. As Darius mentioned, the impacts of
anything that has been enacted as of today, so the Section 232 tariffs, has
been considered in our full year outlook.

I'll cover the expectations for the second quarter on Slide
9. We exited the first quarter with strong order rates and backlogs, which we
expect will drive strong organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. In the
second quarter, segment margins are expected to expand 30 to 50 basis points,
driven by increased volumes, Commercial Excellence and productivity net of
inflation, leading to earnings per share of $1.97 to $2.03 or growth of 9% to
13%.

We expect that our second quarter tax rate will approximate
24% and continue to expect that our full year tax rate will be between 22% and
23%. Consistent with our previous communications, guidance for the second
quarter and the full year excludes cost related to Homes and Transportation
Systems' spinoffs as well as adjustments, if any, to last year's provisional
charge related to the tax reform legislation.

In Aerospace, we expect continued strength in Commercial
Aviation original equipment sales. On the Air Transport and Regional side,
growth will be driven by demand for the Boeing 737 and A318 and A320. We also
expect continued growth in Business & General Aviation as the oversupply of
used aircraft continues to subside, OE new platform certifications are attained
and mandates continue to come into effect.

Within the aftermarket, we expect strong repair and overhaul
demand, driven by flight hour growth in both ATR and business aviation. We
anticipate continued double-digit growth in the defense business with robust spares
volume both in the U.S. and internationally, F-35 demand and growth in sensors
and guidance products.

Within Transportation Systems, we expect similar dynamics as
the first quarter, that is strong gas turbo demand in China and the U.S. and
continued growth in commercial vehicles.

In Home and Building Technologies, we anticipate continued
growth in homes products, driven by strong demand for thermostats and
residential thermal solutions and continued strength in ADI globally as a
result of Commercial Excellence and High Growth Regions efforts in that
business. On the building side of the business, strong orders exiting the first
quarter point to robust demand for building products, particularly commercial
fire products. And we expect continued momentum in Building Solutions.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, the second
quarter dynamics are expected to be similar to those of the first quarter. In
UOP, we expect growth across all businesses, including strength in licensing
and equipment, catalyst demand driven by new units and reloads in China and gas
processing and hydrogen backlog conversion. Exiting the first quarter, our
order rates were up double digit for Smart Energy and thermal solutions and
Process Solutions, which will drive continued demand for those products in the
second quarter. In Advanced Materials, we expect continued customer adoption of
our Solstice low global warming products for applications like supermarket
refrigeration, aerosols and foam insulation in addition to ongoing momentum in
Solstice mobile air-conditioning.

Second quarter margin performance in PMT will be driven by
similar forces as the first quarter with benefits from productivity, increased
volumes and Commercial Excellence, partially offset by the mix of higher equipment
and engineering growth, sales of lower-margin catalysts and higher installation
services revenue within the gas processing business.

Our PMT installed base is large and continues to grow. UOP
backlog is up more than 15%, putting us in a really great position, which will
drive strong future profitable growth as these projects enter into our
serviceable installed base.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we anticipate
continued double-digit growth in Intelligrated, building off strong orders and
long-cycle backlog from the first quarter. Safety will also be strong,
significant demand for Gas Detection and high-risk Safety Products. Within the
productivity business, we expect continued demand for legacy sensing products,
building on strong first quarter orders growth in that business. Additionally,
our new Android-based product launches are starting to drive growth.

I'll move to Slide 10 to cover our revised full year
guidance. We've updated our full year sales, earnings per share and free cash
flow guidance to reflect our stronger-than-expected performance in the first
quarter as well as our confidence in the outlook for the remainder of 2018. Our
revised guidance incorporates the impacts of enacted new U.S. tariffs for steel
and aluminum. As I discussed previously, we expect to fully mitigate the effect
of the steel and aluminum tariffs in each business unit. We're also working
through plans to address the impact, if any, from other potential tariffs that
had been announced but not enacted.

Full year organic sales are now expected to be up 3% to 5%.
This is driven by favorable conditions in our end markets, our emphasis on
organic growth initiatives like Commercial Excellence and continued penetration
in High Growth Regions, along with robust long-cycle orders and backlogs. On a
segment level, we now expect Aerospace organic sales to be up 3% to 5% versus a
previous range of 1% to 3%, driven by an improved Commercial OE outlook,
particularly in business aviation, and strong demand within our U.S. defense
business.

The organic growth rate and margin outlooks for all other
segments are unchanged. We have updated the reported figures to reflect the
anticipated continued tailwind from foreign currency translation. Our segment
margin estimates for the full year remain unchanged. We raised the low end of
our free cash flow guidance by $100 million and continue to target free cash
flow growth of more than 20%, driven by higher net income, lower CapEx and
better working capital performance in all of our businesses.

Our estimated full year effective tax rate continue to be
between 22% and 23% and our guidance is planned at the higher end of that
range. As Darius mentioned, we also raised our full year EPS guidance by $0.10
on the low end and $0.05 on the high end. The new range of $7.85 to $8.05
represents earnings growth of 10% to 13%. Our guidance reflects a revised
weighted average share count of 758 million shares, which is approximately --
which is down approximately 2% from 2017 and does not reflect additional share
repurchases that might occur over the remaining course of 2018.

Let me wrap up on Slide 11. The first quarter was an
outstanding start to 2018: 5% organic sales growth, 14% earnings growth, 30%
free cash flow growth and impactful Connected product launches across the
portfolio. We expect the momentum to continue. We've got strong order rates and
a growing backlog as we begin the second quarter. Our second quarter EPS guide
of $1.97 to $2.03 reflects that momentum. We raised our full year guidance to reflect
our performance and the positive macro environment in many of our end markets
and continue to be well positioned for outperformance in 2018. The preparation
for our 2 spinoffs, Homes and Transportation Systems, continues. And we're on
track for their timely completion.

So with that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.

MARK MACALUSO: Thanks, Tom. Darius and Tom are now available
to answer your questions. So Kathy, if you could, please open the line for
Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will
come from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Can you just walk through the -- kind of as you look at the second
half, some of the puts and takes in some of the businesses that will either
accelerate or decelerate? I mean, I think this quarter was obviously good
organic growth. It was a little bit bifurcated with some doing well and some
more in the low single digits. Maybe if you could talk about some of the
subsegments that move around in the back half of the year.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Sure, I can start and then turn it over
to Tom. I mean, I think overall, kind of the summary note is we're pretty --
we're fairly bullish on all the segments. Obviously, aero started off the year very,
very strong from top line growth rate. We anticipate that mix to change a bit
more between OE and aftermarket. So that might temper the growth rate at the
top level, but nevertheless, should improve margin performance. In terms of
PMT, we see acceleration clearly in the second half of the year, particularly
in HPS and UOP, especially given the kind of order rates that we've seen and
also a much more favorable mix going forward. HBT, a very solid quarter, we
expect that one to kind of remain steady for the year. We don't see sort of any
major changes versus the kind of run rates we've seen. And then SPS, I think
that one, the growth rates there we anticipate to be similar, if not higher,
going forward, certainly even more upsides from Intelligrated, further recovery
from the productivity products business and safety. So overall, kind of flat to
down. So that's sort of at a higher level. Tom, if you want to just...

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. No, I mean, the only thing I'd add
is, and it's a good summary, the strong performance in the first quarter across
the board. I think Aerospace in particular was the one that gave us more lift
than we had anticipated. And that's the reason we're principally raising the
guide for sales growth for the rest of the year. Most -- the other 3
businesses, the growth guidance is the same. And then margin guidance for each
of the business, relatively similar to what we had guided previously.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: And aero is -- the commercial aero OE
drivers, is that -- was that large commercial? Or was that beginning to see
some of the bizjet pickup?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: It's both. We've got close to
double-digit growth in both of the segments.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. And then one last one, Darius,
acquisition pipeline. Any change in your view there? There was some buzz about
perhaps a big catalyst deal. How do you view the catalyst space? It's not
obviously a software-related asset. But is it something that obviously you guys
continue to find attractive? Or is it -- would you rather focus your
acquisition dollars on more software-specific assets, Connected assets?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. So I would say the pipeline
continues to be robust. I wouldn't believe everything you read, Steve. But I
think overall, as we look at our UOP business, that's one of our -- that's one
of the best businesses we have in the portfolio. And anything we can do to
complement and augment it, it's probably something that would certainly deserve
a look. But overall, I mean, I think you saw we deployed capital in Q1. I
thought the stock was a deal at $165 a share. In the low s$140, it becomes
absolute no-brainer. So we did deploy capital a bit more aggressively in Q1
than we anticipated, given the opportunistic market that presented itself. But
I will tell you that we're very aggressively looking at potential M&A. And
we expect something to happen here, hopefully in the next quarter or 2.

OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Gautam Khanna of
Cowen and Company.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY,
LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just to follow up on that last question, I was hoping
you could expand upon what types of maybe acquisition sizes you're seeing out
there. What would be a reasonable expectation this year in terms of how much
capital you may deploy for acquisitions? I know it's hard to tell. But any more
color on...

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No, I think there are so many factors
involved here that it's -- to say this kind of size and this kind of size. It
all depends what the opportunities are. I think I've stated before, and I'll
stay consistent, that our preference is for bolt-on acquisitions, so roughly in
that $3 billion or less ZIP code purchase price. That's sort of a rough figure.
But that's kind of what I'd expect. And based on the pipeline and based on what
we see in there, I'm still fairly confident of that figure. So that's kind of
my expectations. I don't anticipate any sort of mega deals out there. I don't
see that happening, so kind of expect something $3 billion or less in that kind
of a range.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA: And one follow-up. Darius, in the past,
you've talked about how portfolio review is going to be kind of an iterative
process. You obviously have the spins. I'm just curious. I mean, are there
other things in the portfolio that, as you learn more about, maybe don't fit?
Or I'm just curious how evolutionary is this process. Or do you basically have
what you need and [it's definitely not]?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: No, no, no, it's definitely -- no, it's
going to -- we look at that a couple times a year, at least a couple times a
year, if not more. So we're continuously looking at the deep dive of our
portfolio. Our internal strategic planning period is in July. So as you can
imagine, it's going to be another full review and we do that 2, 3 times a year.
So as I mentioned last year, the portfolio is always going to be evolving.
We're always going to be making it better and kind of adding to the top,
subtracting from the bottom businesses that we don't classify as Honeywell
businesses that may be fantastic businesses in their own right, but frankly
don't fit the Honeywell portfolio. So I expect that kind of a top-grading
process and a bit -- what is a Honeywell business to continue. Not that -- by
the way, not that there's anything imminent, but you should expect us to
continue to review our portfolio.

OPERATOR: We will now move to Julian Mitchell of Barclays.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL, RESEARCH ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: My first question really around the segment margin guide. So
Q1 was up about 40 bps. I think the top end of the second quarter margin guide
is up 50. And you've got the full year at the top end up around 60. So I guess
aviation or Aerospace, I can understand, you've got the mix headwind maybe
abating as you go through the year in terms of OE versus aftermarket. But I
just wondered if there was anything else you'd call out, either within
Aerospace or other segments, like inflation or currency impacts on margin that
you think will reverse.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: No, I don't think there's any major
changes from what we've talked about in the original guide. I mean, we are
seeing a little bit more inflation. But I think we're able to offset that
through our productivity initiatives. And mix-wise, it's -- it isn't really
much of a different dynamic except, as I said, for Aerospace, we've got a bit
heavier on the OE side. And within the defense business, we've got a different
mix on platforms. But other than that, we're pretty much in line with what we
had guided.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL: Understood. And the cadence on
productivity savings and so on is fairly smooth through the year?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, pretty much.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: It is. I think the other thing I would
just point out, Julian, is that with this kind of a revenue beat, we still came
in right dead center of our range on margin expansion. That's not that easy to
do, right? When you beat revenue, generally there's -- you take some hit in
terms of margin expansion. And we did both. We beat revenue and stayed very
much bull's-eye on exactly what we say we were going to do on margin expansion.
So I think that, that's a good set of facts.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL: Understood. And then my follow-up
would just be around process. I think you called out a good short-cycle demand,
areas like instrumentation and aftermarket activity. Just wondered what you're
seeing on the large project side within Process Solutions in terms of orders
and quoting activity of customers.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, we're actually bullish on the
second half, especially as we look at our order pipeline and some of the mega
deals that we haven't seen in a while. It's actually the order pipeline looks
very robust. And we actually expect then improvement in terms of some of the
potential larger deals in the second half of this year. So we remain -- we very
much remain bullish on the process business with continued growth. And we
anticipate securing some of those larger mega deals in the second half of this
year.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: The other thing I'd mention, Julian, is
the -- when you look at process, you see the impact of the growth in the
installed base because the service bank continues to grow nicely for us. And
it's pushing double digits in terms of the backlog of service banks. So we're
really encouraged by continued investments in projects that build out that
installed base and give us that momentum going forward.

OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Jeffrey Sprague
of Vertical Research Partners.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, VERTICAL
RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: Just a couple things on my mind. First, just on the
cost and on the tariff situation, was there a particular reason you called out
UOP as at-risk to Chinese retaliation? Why that and not possibly other areas of
Honeywell in China?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, I mean, when you look at the --
well, first of all, I mean, aluminum and steel, I mean, we're not a heavy metal
company. It's -- we're not -- I mean, we're technology, so not a lot of steel
and aluminum. But when you look at the tariffs that are country-specific, those
don't tend to distinguish between commodities. And in our case, there was a
fair amount of activity in UOP around catalyst technology and equipment that
flows between the 2 countries. And that's one we're watching closely. We've got
some fairly good contingency plans that we are developing and are in place. So
we're not counting on this just evaporating and going away. Some involve
changes to the supply chain. Some involve acceleration. Some involve working
with our customers on different outcomes. But rest assured that Rajeev and
Rebecca, Darius are all very much focused on how to deal with the impacts.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. And I think the other thing, Jeff,
just to point out is that a lot of this stuff has not actually been enacted
yet. But nevertheless, we want to make sure we're prepared through a
combination of shifting of the supply chains, alternative supply chains, value
capture, all those elements. So we want to make sure that we're prepared and
also offering comment to a lot of the proposed tariffs. So we're kind of
working this one on many, many fronts to make sure that we don't get caught
flat-footed.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: And then just a couple other quick
ones. Just on cash flow, Tom, I think you said you're driving towards 20%-plus.
Obviously, your range is, I think, 7% to 20%. So it sounds like you've got some
confidence or visibility in that. What needs to happen to get to the upper end
of the cash flow range?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: I think we need to do more of what we did
in the first quarter. Actually, what was really nice about the first quarter
was that our working capital was about -- when you look at our statement of
cash flows, you'll see the amounts we put into working capital were identical
year-over-year despite the significant growth that we had on the top line. So
we're managing that well. And I think if we can continue to do that, we'll be
in good shape. The other thing that, of course, is helping us is we've moderated
our CapEx spend. I think our CapEx spend in the quarter was down probably $30
million or so year-over-year. So between those 2 factors and the good volume, I
think we are on that trajectory that you referred to.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: And then just quickly, I understand
all the mix effects going on in aero. But I was little surprised you said you
see aftermarket only growing low to mid-singles this year. The [RPMs] and other
data would suggest it should be better than that. Is there anything unusual going
on there for you? And I'll pass the floor.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: No, Jeff, I don't think so. I mean, for
us, there certainly is a fair amount of new installed base getting built out.
And you have some of the older models that would drive the good service bank
and good service business coming out of service actually, so -- and while the
new installed base is under warranty, you tend to see a little bit lower
revenues on the service side. But overall, both on spares and R&O, the
demand is pretty healthy. And hopefully, we'll continue to drive an accelerated
growth over the 4% that we had in the first quarter.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. One other, maybe, fact to point
out, Jeff, is that we're also driving much more service contracts rather than
break/fix events. And we just feel that, that's the right way to operate with
our customers. So we probably will have a little bit less cyclicality than some
of the others because we want to drive a much more consistent revenue stream
rather than kind of a break-and-fix approach. And I think it's one that we've
done in a lot of our other businesses, which really aligns our objectives,
which is greater durability, better reliability that goes with the customer
rather than the opposite. So that's also a factor here. And Tim and his team
are driving a lot of service contracts, both around the Connected Aircraft as
well as the service agreements.

OPERATOR: And our next question will come from Andrew
Kaplowitz with Citi.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ, MD AND U.S. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR HEAD, CITIGROUP
INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Darius or Tom, aero service, you just mentioned,
obviously a little slower. But Aerospace organic growth has been accelerating
every quarter for over a year now as you know. And business jets and U.S.
defense spending both became further accelerated. So what's really holding you
back from recording mid- to even high single-digit organic growth for the year?
Is it just more difficult second half comparisons and maybe still a little
conservatism in your forecast?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, I mean, I think obviously we did
bump it up this quarter. Overall, we bumped up the guide on the revenue for the
year after 1 quarter. And we're going to see how it goes. Provided we continue
to see these kinds of booking rates, these kind of growth rates, there may be
further opportunities in the second half of the year. It's 1 quarter in and
although I'm extraordinarily optimistic both on the Aerospace prospects as well
as the broader Honeywell, I also have to note it's 1 quarter. So as we continue
to see the business progress, potentially there could be more upside in the
second half of the year. But we'll see.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ: And Darius, you mentioned long-cycle
backlog of the company was up double digits, which is really good to see. It
doesn't seem like you've had any recent erosion in your short-cycle business.
But maybe could you address that? Have you seen anything in March and April
with the sort of increase in rhetoric around protectionism? Or is it just
steady as she goes for the company here?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: It's been a bit steady as we go. I mean,
March was actually a very, very strong month for us. January was a little bit
slower on the short-cycle business. So it's a little bit difficult for me to
develop a trend here. And most of the tariff and trade protectionism
announcements have been March and April. So impact, if any, is not -- yet to be
felt. We're -- April seems to be pretty reasonable based on what we see so far.
So we're not seeing major impact yet. But I also think it's really important,
as I pointed out to Jeff, that we're prepared and we take appropriate actions
to mitigate any potential enactment of the tariffs. So, so far, so good. But we
don't know what we don't know. And clearly, the geopolitical environment today
is different than it was 3 months ago. And we probably -- we don't know more
today than 3 months ago.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ: And as of now, China is quite
resilient, right, growth, high single digits, low double digits, something like
that.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. No, China growth over -- in Q1 was
north of 20%. So I was actually a little bit more worried about China for this
year. But based on Q1 -- and that's coupled in Q1 with not a particularly great
air and water quarter. And even despite all those challenges in that business,
we still grew more than 20%. So that gives you an idea of the kind of positions
that we enjoy in China and certainly the kind of growth that we continue to
experience.

OPERATOR: And we will now go to Scott Davis of Melius
Research.

SCOTT REED DAVIS, FOUNDING PARTNER, CHAIRMAN, CEO &
RESEARCH ANALYST OF MULTI-INDUSTRY RESEARCH, MELIUS RESEARCH LLC: You just
talked about China. But can we walk around the rest of the world a little bit
more on both the current quarter and what your outlook is?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, sure, Scott. So I think in general,
our overall High Growth Regions was high single digit, so right about where we
were planning. I would tell you China was a highlight, growing north of 20%.
India was a little bit slower, think mid-single digit. That was a bit of a
surprise. But we expect that to recover in the rest of the year. Middle East,
we're seeing some uptick in activity, think about mid-single digit there as
well. In terms of, broadly, some of our challenges, it continues to be a little
bit of a challenge, is Latin America, namely Brazil, that we don't see much of
a recovery. The election later this year, and hopefully continue to see some
stability. But I would say that's challenged. Solid growth both in North
America and Europe so that good level of growth continues there. And overall,
fairly steady and consistent growth profile with the exception of Brazil, which
continues to be a challenge.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. And just on India, Darius mentioned,
it was a little disappointing. But 3 of the 4 businesses were actually double
digits. PMT had some timing on some projects that will push out into the second
quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter. So I think I would expect that India
overall composites growth number to improve sequentially over the course of the
rest of the year.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Okay, helpful. And just back to -- there
has been two questions now on M&A. And I wanted to just dig into one thing.
I mean, when you think about the Analyst Day, there was a lot of, I think,
Darius, as you took over, big focus on Connected products. And when we hear the
rumors out there of potential deals and such, what -- how important is doing --
or building a portfolio from here that has that thematically and some component
at least of IoT?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, I think it's important. But if you
really take a look at the criteria of what the Honeywell business and what I
look for, nowhere does it say it has to be Connected, it has to have an IoT
component. That's actually not one of the criteria. The only thing I do say is
that I like less cyclical rather than more cyclical. But I don't think that,
that's a requirement. Obviously, it's something that we would clearly look at.
But if we take a look at businesses that are less susceptible to disruption,
where we see good growth vectors, which are well aligned to megatrends, tougher
to disrupt, steady growing rather than highly cyclical, they don't necessarily
have to be IIoT-related for us to have an interest. So clearly, those have an
interest but so do technology businesses that don't necessarily have an IIoT
orientation.

OPERATOR: And we now have our question from Peter Arment of
Baird.

PETER J. ARMENT, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD
& CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Tom, a quick one on just bizjet
activity because it's been a while before we've seen this kind of, I guess,
more upbeat around the bizjets. And I know you've got some new launches this
year. So I would expect the OE to be up. But what are you seeing on just the
kind of the aftermarket side? And is this really, I think, a new upturn that
we're finally seeing?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Well, on the OE -- you mean on the OE
side, Peter? Or the...

PETER J. ARMENT: Yes, on the OE. But I mean, also just what
you're seeing also on the aftermarket.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: No, I think the -- I mean, you can read
all the stuff that we read about used jet inventory and the prices and so
forth. That clearly is a favorable factor for us. But I think the biggest thing
is the new launches that are coming out. And we've talked a lot about in the
last couple of years about our winning positions on the various platforms. And
whether it's Cessna, Gulfstream and so forth, they've got certifications coming
out in '18. And that's going to be a nice factor for us. The other thing is the
mandates. You continue to see some of these mandates coming into effect up and
through 2020, 2021. I mean, that's going to drive growth as well. So as I said,
we -- for the first quarter, we approached double-digit growth in the OE on
both ATR and BGA. And knock on wood, we're encouraged by the momentum.

PETER J. ARMENT: Okay. And just a clarification, on your air
transport aftermarket number, you're up 4% in the quarter. But is this -- I mean,
you had some very strong numbers last year. Is this more, I think, a
normalization or tougher comps when we think about 2018?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: I think it's kind of what I was saying
earlier. I mean, overall, the level of activity has been robust. You are seeing
a different mix in the installed base of newer aircraft that are under
warranty, have less maintenance. You see older aircraft coming out. But beyond
that, the level of both repair and [overhaul] activity on spares has been
solid.

OPERATOR: We will now move next to Joseph Ritchie of Goldman
Sachs.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE, VP & LEAD MULTI-INDUSTRY ANALYST,
GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Tom, if I heard you correctly, you
mentioned the impact from tax reform is likely to be felt a little bit more in
the second half of the year. And so like, look, the organic growth rate has
been great the last few quarters. Maybe talk a little bit about how customer
conversations are evolving in the parts of your portfolio that you would expect
to benefit the most if you do start to see an increase in CapEx investing as
the year progresses.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. I mean, I would point to our
long-cycle businesses, I think. I mean, we just got done talking about business
jet. That could be a factor that's contributing to that OE momentum that I
referenced. I think on the oil and gas side, I mean, I think it's more to do
with stability on the pricing and the confidence that it's giving the industry,
where you're going to see more CapEx will return to -- not return to previous
peak levels but certainly an improvement from the declines we've seen in the
last couple of years. Those are the, I think, 2 places that I would say we see
it the most.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE: Okay. And then maybe following on, on
Peter's question for just a second. I didn't hear you guys mention anything on
the commercial helo market. I'd be curious to hear any commentary there, just
given there's this uptick we've seen in oil and gas recently.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, I think commercial helo is probably
not a highlight yet. We don't see sort of major robust level of activity there
yet. But I think we're more than enthused based on what we're seeing on the --
our air transport and now uptick in activity in business jet. So I guess, there
always has to be one a little bit of a lowlight. And I would say there's not as
strong a recovery as we would have hoped on commercial helo. But nevertheless,
the rest of the Aerospace business is very strong, so...

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: And it's not that it's negative. I mean,
internationally, as an example, we are seeing very modest growth on the helo
side. But it's not what we were experiencing a year ago or 2 years ago in terms
of the pressures.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE: Got it. And then maybe if I could sneak
in one last one. On PMT, the margin trajectory, so it sounds like the first
half of the year, you're kind of calling for kind of flattish-type margins in
PMT. As we progress through the year, mix gets a little bit better. Is that --
do you already have a lot of that mix in your backlog today? Or do you need to
see something out of orders in order to see kind of like the margin improvement
in the second half?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, Joe, as you know, PMT is
such a tough business to judge based on 1 quarter because, as you know, the
catalyst makeup and what we ship and the mix, particularly with UOP can
dramatically change the results. So both based on the backlogs that we see,
based on the short-cycle activity in HPS and so on, when we get to the end of
the year, we're very comfortable that the margin expansion is going to look
very much in line with what we're projecting and continue to be very, very
bullish on the PMT business.

OPERATOR: And we have time for one last question. And that
will come from Steven Winoker of UBS.

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER, MD & INDUSTRIALS ANALYST, UBS
INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Darius, I can't help but go back to one of
your first comments, which was the fact that the stock's a no-brainer in the
s$140. You did spend $950 million on the share repo this quarter. That's a good
number. But if you're only looking for these acquisitions in the $3 billion or
less range, you've got cash continuing to come in, why not step in even more
aggressively? Or how are you kind of thinking about that? Is it just to keep
the powder dry and be more methodical? Or are you really try to be more
opportunistic, in which case it might be larger?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Well, I think obviously this is -- what
we bought back in Q1 is higher than what we normally do. If you look back about
our buyback trends, this level of buyback in Q1 is actually relatively
aggressive because I just -- like I said, I thought it was a steal at $165. In
the s$140, it was just absolutely compelling. Now having said that, you're
right. I mean, I do want to keep the powder dry. We indicated both at our
Investor Day and our Q1 -- or our Q4 call that we have a slight preference for
M&A. So as we kind of see the year evolve, we'll see how things change. As
I mentioned prior in the call, we do have fairly robust M&A pipeline. I do
hope that 1 or 2 deals materialize here in the next quarter or 2. And we'll see
how it goes. So it's -- I know it's kind of deploying everything all at once
and [without] having further optionality I don't think is ever a great idea. So
that's kind of how we're thinking about it. But I think the value of the stock
currently is compelling at the same time. So it's the constant tradeoff that we
go through.

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER: And one other one on aero, which is
there's a lot still being discussed about the large air framers partnering for
success, et cetera, and kind of continuing to apply pressure in thinking about
how to change the business models in the industry. Are you seeing any other
kind of early developments on that front? Are you -- what gives you confidence,
conviction that your business model will be able to sustain itself in light of
that attempted vertical integration?

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: Yes, I mean, I think both -- well, a
couple of things. Number one is our relationship with Boeing remains strong and
we expect that to continue. Number two, I think as you look at our services
that I referred to earlier, as you think about the value story around the
Connected Aircraft, that's compelling to our end customers. And that's
reflected into service rates, the order rates that we're seeing, the interest
that I talked about, the deal with Singapore. And if you think about Singapore,
it's clearly one of the market leaders in terms of their thinking and their
approach to aviation. So I remain very, very bullish on our approach. And given
the kind of set of offerings that we have in the Aerospace segment, both in
mechanical and avionics, we're uniquely positioned to be a key player in the
Connected Aircraft. And it's being reflected in the kind of relationships we're
able to formulate and the kind of business we're enjoying. And I think it's
only going to accelerate.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: I was going to say the technologies that
we have invested in and the number of engineers that we have supporting all of
the different product platforms and the verticals that we serve puts us in a
very unique position in terms of developing offerings that get us on platforms,
as you've seen over the last few years, for us to continue to win more than our
fair share. So it's that -- it's those investments and keeping those fresh and
alive are what's going to enable us to compete robustly.

OPERATOR: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does
conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the
conference back to Mr. Darius Adamczyk for any additional closing remarks.

DARIUS E. ADAMCZYK: We delivered exceptional results in the
first quarter of 2018 and have strong order rates and a growing backlog as we begin
the second quarter. I am confident in our ability to deliver outstanding
results for our customers, our shareowners and our employees. One last note, in
a few weeks, we'll be hosting an investor showcase to highlight our Safety and
Productivity Solutions business, particularly our technologies for the
Connected warehouse and the Connected Supply Chain. John Waldron and his team
are looking forward to showing you why we're so excited about the growth
opportunities in that business. Enjoy the rest of your day, and we'll talk with
you soon. Thank you.

OPERATOR: This does conclude today's teleconference. Please
disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
Honeywell's fourth quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) As
a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

And I would now like to introduce your host for today's
conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President, Investor Relations.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.:
Thanks, Derek. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's Fourth Quarter 2017
Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are our President and CEO, Darius
Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek.
As a reminder, this call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations,
are available on our website at 

.

Note that elements of this presentation contain
forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of
our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we ask that
you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and
uncertainties that affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and
other SEC filings. This morning, we will review our financial results for the
fourth quarter and full year 2017, share our guidance for the first quarter of
2018 and discuss how the recent U.S. tax reform impacts Honeywell. As always,
we'll leave time for your questions at the end.

So with that, let me turn the call over to President and
CEO, Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK, PRESIDENT, CEO & DIRECTOR, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Honeywell
delivered an exceptionally strong fourth quarter with earnings per share of
$1.85, enabled by organic sales growth of 6%, which reflects our renewed
emphasis on commercial excellence, revitalization of the Velocity Product
Development process and the benefits from growth investments. In 2017, we
expanded our sales force in key regions and businesses and armed all our sales
teams with the newest digital tools that are helping us win in the marketplace.
We also revitalized our new product development process to ensure that the
products we're selling are delivering value to our customers. Our order rates
continue to grow, and our backlogs are strong as we head into 2018.

Cash was a highlight as we generated $4.9 billion of free
cash flow in 2017, above the high end of the guidance range. In Q4, we achieved
123% conversion, which brought full year conversion to 90% or 109% excluding
the effect of pension.

Our efforts to improve working capital discipline are
working. While I'm encouraged by our progress in this area, there is still
significant opportunity. And each of our businesses is taking the necessary
steps to improve their working capital performance.

Full year earnings per share were $7.11, up 10%
year-over-year. This growth excludes the impact of separations costs for spin
and charges for the fourth quarter 2016 debt refinancing, pension
mark-to-market and Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our EPS exceeded the guidance we
provided in December, driven by 4% organic growth and 70 basis points of margin
expansion.

We also continued to aggressively deploy capital for our
shareowners in 2017. We increased our dividend by 12% this year, which marked
the eighth double-digit increase since 2010. And we bought back $1.6 billion of
shares in the fourth quarter and $2.9 billion for the full year. As a company,
our total shareowner return was 35%, far exceeding the S&P 500 TSR of 22%.

Today, we are raising our full year 2018 EPS guidance to
$7.75 to $8, which reflects a lower expected tax rate as a result of the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act. Tom will walk you through the tax reform detail later in the
call. But I'm pleased to announce today that our 2017 performance, coupled with
the anticipated benefits from this legislation, has enabled us to increase our
401(k) employer match for Honeywell employees in the U.S. This change
represents a sustained, long-term commitment to provide enhanced financial
security in retirement, which we believe is extremely valuable and important to
employees. Honeywell remains committed to being an employer of choice.

Let's turn to Slide 3 to highlight a few of our recent
commercial successes. In Aerospace, United Airlines selected Honeywell avionics
for its new fleet of more than 150 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes. The flight deck
package will include the first-ever installment of Honeywell SmartRunway and
SmartLanding on a Boeing 737 MAX and will feature Honeywell's integrated
multi-mode receiver and IntuVue weather radar system, which can enable
connected radar, a part of our Connected Aircraft offering, allowing Honeywell
to download weather hazard data and provide pilots and dispatchers immediate
information through the GoDirect weather app. Honeywell solutions work in
tandem to greatly improve passenger safety and comfort during takeoff, landing
and potentially hazardous weather conditions. We are excited about our
continued partnership with United Airlines.

In Home and Building Technologies, Honeywell designed a new
contemporary and state-of-the-art connected home solution and we signed a
long-term agreement with ADT, a leading provider of security and automation
solutions in the United States and Canada, to sell it exclusively through ADT's
direct and professional dealer network. This solution includes security, smoke
detection, carbon monoxide detection, innovative long-range and
battery-operated motion viewers and home automation and incorporates both ADT's
and Honeywell's User Experience. We are excited to continue our long-term
partnership with ADT, providing their customers the most innovative products
for the connected home.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, Honeywell Process
Solutions leveraged connected plant offerings to position Honeywell as a
specialized software industrial partner, ultimately winning 3 strategic
projects with Kuwait Oil Company to enhance crude production at Southeast
Kuwait fields. Honeywell will provide software and services to help KOC
visualize and optimize the production and operations in the fields and will
supply an integrated control and safety system based on our Experion PKS and
Safety Manager technology for a gathering station. This project enhances the
capacity and capability of the existing facility in East Kuwait to manage
excess water while keeping crude production at the facility's designated
capacity.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we achieved major wins
with 2 global package delivery companies to provide more than 100,000
Android-based handheld computers that will aid in delivery operations. We are
seeing strong adoption of our new Android-based offerings and have significant
new launches planned for early this year that will drive growth for the
Productivity products business in the second half of the year. A number of
these technologies will be on display at our Annual Investor Conference, which
will take place on February 28 at Honeywell's headquarters in Morris Plains,
New Jersey. I'm looking forward to talking with you more about our progress
then.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will
discuss our financials.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK, SENIOR VP & CFO, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thanks, Darius. Good morning. I'm on Slide 4. As Darius
mentioned, we achieved 6% organic sales growth this quarter, capping off a very
strong year. Our growth improved sequentially every quarter in 2017, starting
with 2% in the first quarter. This is a reflection of the investments we've
made in the sales organization, the M&A that we've done, our capacity
expansions and new product development, coupled with an improved economic
environment in many of our end markets. We generated more than $2 billion in
segment profit in the fourth quarter through our continued focus on effective
selling and operational excellence. We experienced strong volumes, primarily in
Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solutions. Our margin rate increased by
30 basis points to 19.3%, stronger than we previewed in December, primarily due
to stronger-than-anticipated demand in the Air Transport and Regional
aftermarket.

Earnings per share was $0.01 better than our preview in
December and includes a $0.19 contribution from segment profit. Our tax
planning actions drove a lower-than-planned tax rate for the fourth quarter of
16.5%. Now this is before the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The lower
tax rate and lower share count, driven by the share repurchase activity Darius
mentioned, combined for a $0.22 benefit, which was more than offset by
restructuring and other projects we funded in the quarter, which was a $0.30
headwind. We funded over $150 million in attractive restructuring projects this
quarter that will improve our cost structure, drive further productivity and
address the potential residual costs that would otherwise result from the
upcoming spin transactions.

On a reported basis, we had a loss per share of $3.18,
driven by the impact of the $3.8 billion TCJA charge. That reported loss also
includes an $87 million pretax pension mark-to-market adjustment, primarily
related to a lower discount rate, and $16 million in pretax spin-related
separation costs.

Our free cash flow in the fourth quarter was very strong at
$1.8 billion or 123% conversion. We're in the early stages of our working
capital initiatives, but we're encouraged by the progress so far, and more
importantly, by the opportunities that we intend to pursue in 2018.

Overall, another strong performance with high-quality
earnings to cap off a great year.

Let's turn to Slide 5 to discuss our segment results for the
fourth quarter. Starting with Aerospace, sales were up 5% organically, 2
percentage points above the high end of our sales guidance.

In Commercial OE, we saw improved air transport deliveries
on key platforms, including the Airbus A320 and A330 and Boeing 737, and the
benefit of lower OEM customer incentives, partially offset by slow demand in
business jets, as expected.

Growth in the aftermarket was stronger than anticipated,
driven primarily by air transport, repair and overhaul activities and sales of
spares in Business Aviation.

In Defense, we saw continued strength in U.S. core defense,
driven by spares demand and deliveries on the F-35 and Apache platforms.

In Transportation Systems, we saw a robust demand in
commercial vehicles across all regions and continued growth in light vehicle
gas turbos in China and South Korea.

Aerospace margins were up 270 basis points, driven primarily
by higher volumes, productivity net of inflation, slightly more modest OEM and
customer incentives and commercial excellence. Aerospace margin performance was
well ahead of our expectations.

In Home and Building Technologies, organic sales growth was
3% for the quarter. As a reminder, we realigned the Smart Energy business from
HBT into PMT in the fourth quarter. So the HBT results for this quarter and
going forward now exclude Smart Energy. Organic growth in products of 2% was
driven primarily by the commercial fire business and Environmental & Energy
Solutions in Europe. There was continued strength in Global Distribution,
particularly in the fire vertical.

Our businesses in China grew high single digits, with
strength in all of the HBT businesses.

HBT segment margins contracted 40 basis points, driven by
lower residential security volumes, investments for growth and a different
regional mix.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales were up 9%
on an organic basis, driven by growth across UOP, Process Solutions and
Advanced Materials. That's the entire PMT portfolio.

In UOP, there was strong demand for our modular equipment,
strong initial catalyst loads in the Middle East and significant growth from
natural gas project wins at UOP, Russell in Russia and in North America.

Growth in the short-cycle businesses within HPS continued to
be strong with significant demand for thermal solutions and field instruments.

In Advanced Materials, we again achieved double-digit
organic sales growth, fueled primarily by our Solstice low global-warming
refrigerant for mobile air-conditioning.

PMT segment margins contracted 100 basis -- 180 basis points
in the quarter, primarily driven by the unplanned plant outage we flagged in
November and a different year-over-year mix of sales in UOP. The lower margin
performance is also in part due to integration of Smart Energy, which was not
contemplated in our original fourth quarter guidance.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales were up 12% on
an organic basis, exceeding the guidance we provided in October, driven by
another strong quarter at Intelligrated, building on the robust orders and
backlog growth throughout 2017. We had a significant increase in retail
business sales as our direct selling strategy matured as well as continued
strength in China. The results saw robust growth in the Safety business as
refinery maintenance resumed, driving demand for our entire range of Safety
Products and continued strong demand for our legacy Sensing Controls and
Workflow Solutions, including solutions provided by Vocollect and Movilizer.

The mobility business remained soft, but we secured large
orders -- several large orders for our new Android-based products, which Darius
mentioned.

As a result of strong volumes in SPS, margins expanded 140
basis points, also exceeding the high end of our guidance, helped further by
the benefits from ongoing productivity efforts and from previously funded
repositioning.

I'm now on Slide 6. I'll be very brief on this slide as
we've discussed each of these measures previously. What this slide does, it
takes us back to the original 2017 guidance and compares it to the final
results. For all categories, the final outcome met or exceeded the original
guidance, so the do matches our say in Honeywell vernacular. Also not included
on this slide are long-cycle orders and backlog. Those results were also
impressive, each growing double digit in 2017.

Let's move to Slide 7 to discuss the recent U.S. tax reform
and its impact on Honeywell's 2018 financials. Honeywell has been a -- has long
been proponent of corporate tax reform that would enable us to compete more
effectively on a global basis and to enjoy efficient and unencumbered movement
of our capital. On December 22, as you know, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
passed. The legislation significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by
lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing the territorial tax system
and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign
subsidiaries.

As a result of the legislation, we recorded a $3.8 billion
provisional charge in the fourth quarter, comprising of 3 elements. The first
is a mandatory transition tax or deemed repatriation charge on the $20 billion
of previously unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. This noncash
charge was recorded entirely in the fourth quarter of 2017, but is to be paid
over an 8-year period in accordance with the legislation.

The second element is also a noncash charge. It's a deferred
tax liability adjustment, favorable in this case, to reflect the impact of the
lower U.S. corporate tax rate on our deferred tax balances.

The third element, also a noncash charge, is for the
implementation of the territorial tax system, including withholding and local
taxes associated with the future repatriation of cash back to the U.S.

These taxes will generally be paid as the cash is repatriated.
This portion of the aggregate charge reflects the tax structures we have in
place today as is required by the accounting rules and does not anticipate the
benefit we would realize from future tax planning.

It's only been a month since the tax reform passed and
further guidance continues to flow, clarifying the legislation. Our accounting
reflects our best estimate using the current information we have available to
us, and the amount of the provisional charge may be adjusted over the course of
2018 as things become clearer. We will update you on the changes, if any, to
the amount of the charge, to our effective tax rate and to other provisions of
the tax legislation which are material to Honeywell.

At our upcoming Investor Day, we will also update you more
completely on the cash repatriation opportunities that we have as well as on
our expectations for the use of those repatriation proceeds.

Preliminarily, we expect that at least $7 billion of the $10
billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries can be repatriated in the next
2 years. And of course, we'll continue to generate overseas cash, which will
add to that pool of potential repatriation. But there still is extensive tax
analysis and planning to be done to ensure we execute repatriation in the most
efficient manner.

This new global mobility of our cash will allow us to
continue investing in our businesses in the U.S.; to pay a competitive
dividend; to more aggressively seek out M&A, particularly in the U.S.; and
to repurchase our own shares. Our preference is for attractive bolt-on
acquisitions in our core markets. But to the extent M&A opportunities do
not materialize, we'll gradually accelerate share repurchases as we did in
2017.

Looking at 2018. As a result of the reduction in the U.S.
corporate tax rate, our effective tax rate is now expected to be between 22%
and 23% versus our normal 25% to 26% historical rate. Given the uncertainties
that still remain around the implementation of tax reform and the extent of the
analysis still to be done, we are conservatively assuming a tax rate of 23% in
our guide, which increases our 2018 EPS guidance range by $0.20 to a new range
of $7.75 to $8 per share, an increase of 9% to 13% from 2017.

So as Darius and I mentioned, we're pleased with the new
legislation, particularly the mobility of capital and global competitiveness it
provides to Honeywell and to our shareholders.

Let's discuss our expectations for the first quarter on
Slide 8. We exited the year with strong order rates and firming backlogs that
we expect will drive a continued acceleration in organic sales growth every
quarter in 2018. Segment margins are expected to expand 30 to 60 basis points,
driven by volume leverage, commercial excellence and productivity net of
inflation, leading to earnings per share of $1.87 to $1.93 or growth of 9% to
13%. This is based on an estimated first quarter tax rate between 22% and 23%.

As we previewed in the December outlook call, the guidance
for the first quarter and full year exclude costs related to Home and Transportation
Systems spin-offs, and adjustments, if any, to the fourth quarter provision for
the tax legislation.

Starting with Aerospace, we expect sales to increase in the
low single-digit range organically. Our Air Transport OE business will be
impacted by fewer deliveries on Boeing 777 and a decrease in production rates
at certain regional OEMs, partially offset by increased A350 deliveries.

On the Business Aviation side, we expect organic sales to
improve as production rates increase across most of our OEM customers, offset
by higher OEM customer incentives.

In the Aftermarket, we expect to see strong spare sales with
airlines across Americas and Asia Pac and demand in maintenance service plans
in Business Aviation.

For Defense, a very similar story to recent quarters with
growth buoyed by demand in U.S. defense, partially offset by declines in Space.

In Transportation Systems, we expect continued light vehicle
gas turbo penetration across most regions, particularly in China, North America
and Europe as well as continued momentum in the commercial vehicle segment.

In Home and Building Technologies, sales will be slightly
up. We expect continued strength in Global Distribution, the commercial fire
business and our businesses in China. We see improving order pipelines in our
EMEA products businesses offset by weaker volumes in residential security in
the U.S.

In Building Solutions, growth will be modest as the robust
high-growth region activity is offset by slower activity on large install and
service projects in the Americas region.

As we progress through our planning for the spin-offs, we
have reorganized Home and Building Technologies to better align with how the
segment will operate going forward. So instead of showing you results from
products and distribution, we'll start reporting on results in the 2 new
reorganized business units, Homes and Buildings. This will be effective when we
release first quarter earnings.

Moving to Performance Materials and Technologies. Sales are
expected to be up low to mid-single digit on an organic basis, driven by
continued conversion of our strong backlog. Entering 2018, PMT long-cycle
backlogs are up 8% from 2017.

In Process Solutions, we also expect continued demand for
our short-cycle software and service offerings and field instrumentation
products.

In UOP, we expect significant catalyst deliveries for new
units in China as well as sustained equipment and engineering growth. Solstice
growth in Advanced Materials is expected to continue, although there are
tougher year-over-year comparisons in the first quarter.

Finally, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, we expect
sales in the mid-single-digit range organically, driven primarily by large
project wins at Intelligrated and strong orders demand exiting the year in Sensing
and IoT and Workflow Solutions, including from Movilizer's cloud service
application.

In Safety, we expect growth across the gas vertical in China
and all lines of business in the Americas as a result of our new product
launches, sales investments and improved market conditions. We also expect
improvement in the retail business.

On a regional basis, the SPS China business is expected to
grow more than 10%, driven by Sensing and IoT, Safety and Productivity products
in the region.

Let's turn to Slide 9. I want to talk about our revised full
year guidance. We've updated our full year margin guidance to reflect our
stronger-than-expected performance in 2017. Full year segment margin is now
expected to be between 19.3% and 19.6%. This reflects 30 to 60 basis points
expansion, which is consistent with what we said in December. The segments have
been updated accordingly.

We've also updated our earnings per share guidance, as
Darius mentioned, to reflect a lower anticipated full year effective tax rate
between 22% and 23% due to the tax legislation.

Full year EPS is now expected to be $7.75 to $8, up 9% to
13% year-over-year, excluding separation costs, the fourth quarter 2017 charge
related to the tax reform and any 2018 adjustments to that charge.

Let me wrap up on Slide 10. Fourth quarter was an
outstanding finish to 2017. We achieved strong sales growth, continued margin
expansion, double-digit earnings growth and exceptional free cash flow
conversion. At the same time, we continued our aggressive capital deployment
with more than $1.5 billion in share repurchases in the quarter and $2.9
million for the full year. We also funded more than $350 million in
restructuring in 2017, which is helping us to proactively address stranded
costs ahead of our 2 planned spin-offs. Both spin-offs remain on track for
completion by the end of this year.

We're also pleased with the passage of U.S. tax reform, and
we've raised our 2018 EPS guidance by $0.20 as a result. We believe that the
tax reform will provide a sustainable, long-term benefit to Honeywell, not a
single quick hit. In that same light, we believe that the benefit that we share
with our work associates should also be a sustainable, long-term benefit. So
we've chosen an ongoing mechanism that will benefit them now and in the years
to come throughout their retirement. That is an increase of the employer
matching contribution in our U.S. 401(k) plans. Our strong order rates and
increased backlog heading into 2018 give us confidence in our first quarter guidance.
We're well positioned for continued outperformance in 2018.

With Mark, let's -- or with that, Mark, let's move to
Q&A.

MARK MACALUSO: Thanks, Tom. Darius and Tom are now available
to answer your questions. So Derek, if you could, please open the line for
Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is
coming from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, VERTICAL
RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: Just a couple of things. First, so just wonder if you
could elaborate a little bit more on Aero margin. It was very strong. Was there
any unusual timing and incentives or program closeouts or anything like that?
It's the first question.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: I wouldn't say there was anything unusual.
We obviously had a very favorable mix as reflected by the Commercial
Aftermarket, and that was probably a little bit even more favorable than we had
anticipated. But I wouldn't say there is any kind of onetime charges, other
than the impact of a more favorable mix of business than we had originally
projected.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: That's really the punchline.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, you might be thinking about the
incentive comment, Jeff, but the 270 basis points expansion, most of that was
the combination of the volume, mix and productivity that we generated. I think
the incentives were probably [25] of the 270, so a small piece of it.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: Okay, great. And then just trying to
kind of wrap up just the cash flow outlook overall. Could you just update us on
what you're thinking about CapEx? Has pension income moved around at all here
at year-end? And does the outlook here anticipate any additional share
repurchase in 2018 at this point?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. I mean starting with CapEx, Jeff. I
mean, we've been peaking in '14 to '16, north of $1.1 billion or so. That'll be
down in the $900 million range or less in 2018 and will continue to go down.
We've got continued emphasis on our working capital, hoping to get another 0.5
point of working capital turns. The HOS Gold tool set is helping with -- us
with that. On pensions, the plan is -- at the end of the year, it was funded
close to 105%. Right now, it's funded probably 110% or more. So it is -- those
assets are driving more income, if you can believe that. But from a cash
perspective, it is a nonevent. I mean, with the plans fully funded, there are
no contributions for the foreseeable future. We think that's in pretty good
shape. And we'll continue to drive the conversion. I mean, our cash conversion
in 2016 was 86%. We told you we're trying to move towards 100%. We hit 90% in
2017, and we think the prospects are good to drive that further in '18.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. And Jeff, it's kind of reflected in
the cash guidance for 2018. I think if you just take -- even if you only take
the midpoint of our guidance, I mean, it's a fairly healthy increase. And as we
discussed at length last year, we're going to continue to make progress on cash
generation and cash conversion just like we showed in 2017 where we reached the
magical 90% level, and that's kind of where we want to -- it's a starting
point.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: Great. And share repurchase? And I'll
cede the floor.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, on share repurchases, Jeff, right
now, the plan is do what we normally do, as I said. So we will be offsetting
the -- any dilution that comes up as a result of option exercises and
contributions to employee benefit plans. But as I also talked about on the
repatriation, there's an opportunity materializing. I mean, the timing is --
needs to be further analyzed. Our priorities overall remain the same and we
prefer to prioritize bolt-on acquisitions that can be accretive to our
businesses. But like in 2017 when the market was a bit more frothy for us in
terms of M&A opportunities, we chose to deploy it towards share repurchase.
We did $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter alone, $2.9 billion for the full year
and we were able to take the share count down for the year over 2%. So that's the
kind of approach that we'll continue to head into the year with.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from John Inch with
Deutsche Bank.

JOHN GEORGE INCH, MD OF MULTI-INDUSTRY SECTOR OF US AND
SENIOR ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: So can we start with just
the core volumes? So you gave the update on December 13. Tom, you thought core
growth would be 7% to 8%. It's 6%, but your numbers are solid with great cash
flow. I guess, my question is, did something happen at the end of the year?
Like was December an anomaly at the very end to cause the core growth
expectations to shift lower kind of by 1.5 points?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: No, I mean, as you can imagine, fourth
quarter is a big volume quarter for our businesses. Aerospace, in particular,
you have a lot of OEM customers and we're kind of partnering with them to meet
their delivery schedules. Those change, and sometimes they -- their deliveries
push out, which was the case for Aerospace. Most of that slight moderation in
the growth rate was due to Aerospace OEM. But as you saw, the growth in Aero
and Honeywell for the fourth quarter organically was still very strong, and we
had a better mix in Aerospace aftermarket, as I said.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: Yes, you did. So Aero was the primary
factor then, is that -- that's the message?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: A little bit in PMT as well, lower-margin
stuff in PMT, but no trends per se. They're more binary kinds of things. These
are large transactions in most cases.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: The shift from Windows to Android, you
guys have called out increasing traction, right, in terms of orders. What --
how does that dynamic work? Like are you still selling the Windows-based
products, but you have to write down the inventory? Like what's actually going
on here? I'm trying to understand how that prospectively impacts the
financials, probably in your margins, I'm assuming, in 2018 for that segment.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. No, I mean, we're still selling both
types of products. And as a matter of fact, the majority of the installed base
in Productivity products is still -- most of the software was still written in
Windows-based code. So we foresee continuing robust sales on the Windows
product offering. But as we discussed on multiple calls last year, Android is
becoming a much more prominent part of our portfolio offering. We've launched
some new products in Q4. We launched some in Q2 and then we have a pretty big
launch coming up here also in Q1. The great news for us, as we highlighted in
the announcement, is we've already secured some major, major wins with these
new offerings that are Android based. So it gives me a lot more confidence
around the future of the Productivity products business. But rest assured,
Microsoft-based mobility offerings, there's -- we're still selling those fairly
aggressively and they still make up more than 50% of our sales.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: And it's the customer, Darius, right, that
incurs -- if they want to shift from Windows to Android, it's sort of a -- it's
their prerogative? It's not as if Honeywell is somehow on the hook to pay
migration costs or something like that, right?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, exactly. They have to convert their
software from Microsoft-based to Android-based. And we're offering our
customers a choice. Some of them are making that conversion, others are
maintaining their current platforms.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: Cash was very strong in the fourth quarter
despite, obviously, the business putting up a robust growth. How do you manage
the '18 cash in terms of growth and acceleration in the economy and the demands
in working capital, but then trying to get working capital out of the system? I
guess, I understand you want to keep a conservative guide, but do you think
there is upside to cash given the backdrop of kind of macro improvement? Or was
there a little bit of an anomaly in the fourth quarter given how strong it was?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: John, I'm an optimist. I always believe
there is upside, but I think there's a couple of factors going for us. Number
one is working capital has been a point of emphasis. We saw -- we had our
senior leadership meeting kickoff early in January, and I can tell you it was
one of the 2 major, major highlights that we talked about. Number two, as Tom
talked about, the reduction in CapEx. And we're not -- I think it's important
to note, we're not constraining CapEx. It's just that we have gone through a
fairly substantial investment cycle and we just see that waning a bit. But if
we see great projects, we're going continue to invest. But nevertheless, we anticipate
that CapEx number being lower this year and even potentially next year. And
three is just being -- we're looking at all these working capital levers, and
all the businesses have what I'd call pretty aggressive targets in terms of
working capital. But then also a last thing to add is we're still assessing a
lot of these moving pieces when it comes to the new tax legislation,
particularly as it relates to cash taxes because, as you know, we have kind of
8 years to pay back that onetime fee, so that's offset somewhat by the
reductions. So we still have some work to do in terms of the overall impact for
the year and we're going to be working -- Tom and his team are going to be
working through all those details.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: Got it. One last one. As inflation,
Darius, comes back into the U.S. economy, how are you thinking about managing
the company in terms of, say, pricing, the trade-off between pricing and cost,
that sort of thing?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. No, that's a good question because
that can be a very dangerous phenomenon. I can tell you that every one of the
SBGs, and that's something that we already implemented last year, is they're
really watching their inflation and the impact on their product costs, and I am
very confident in saying that all of our businesses have a very good process to
monitor their inflation of products and making sure that they're passing that
through to the marketplace. And frankly, the inflationary environment for raw
goods is not new. It's really been in place last year as well, particularly in
the second half. So we've been watching that one carefully and put the
processes in to make sure that we monitor proactively.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with
JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: So just to follow up on John's question on cash flow, just to be
clear. You raised your net income guidance to reflect the tax rate, but you're
basically not raising the cash number because of the uncertainties around this,
the cash going out the door on the transition. Is that kind of how we should
read the lack of guide on raise on free cash?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Well, I mean, our original guide that we
gave you in December, Stephen, was under the provisos of the old law. And every
year, we anticipate some cash benefit from the tax planning that we do. And in
fact, in 2017, we did realize some benefits there. So it's not as if we had
just taken the foot off the brakes on tax planning and the cash management
around tax planning in that original guide. When you look at 2018, there will
be some benefit, certainly on the U.S. side, from that lower cash tax rate. But
it's offset by the payment of the mandatory toll charge. And we need to
continue to study the developments in the legislation before we step out and
say it's going to be huge impact. I mean, the guide range that we gave was
fairly wide in any case, from $5.2 billion to $5.9 billion. So I think we're
still comfortable at this early point sticking to that range.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: And Steve, as you know, we had substantial
overseas cash and retained earnings. So at least for the next 8 years, that is
going to be a bit of a cash drag because we got to pay for that onetime tax
hit.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Yes, okay. Just on the EPS guide, a
little bit of a higher kind of operating base and you guys clearly beat ops
this quarter. Yes, I think you tweaked up your margin assumptions, yet you are
-- and I think share count is coming out a little bit lower than we expected
exiting the year. You're only raising for the tax -- incremental tax benefits.
Is there something else that's kind of below the line or anything else we have
to be aware of? Anything you're concerned about that has slowed down as to why
the raise wasn't -- raise didn't flow a little more through there? Or just
building a little bit more contingency and hedge into the plan?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: I think the -- not a lot has changed
since December. I mean, we actually expected a more robust fourth quarter, as
we said earlier, from a top line perspective. And so overall, the momentum in
each of the businesses is strong and we expect that to continue. Maybe there'll
be some upside on the top line, but in terms of things that we're -- the large
things that we're concerned with that we haven't articulated, there's nothing
of that sort here. Most of the assumptions we talked about in December are
still intact.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, and Steve, just to maybe to add onto
it. I mean, first of all, as you know, 60 -- roughly 60% of our business is
short cycle versus longer cycle. And we're in a new year so it's -- I think,
early on in the year, it's best to be prudent and just really a little more on
the caution side to really see how the business evolves. But having said that,
I can tell you that I'm a lot more bullish on the year heading '17 into '18
versus '16 into '17. Now the comps are a little bit tougher, but nevertheless,
as I look across the entire business portfolio, I can't think of a single
business where I would view as a down arrow versus '17. So overall, things are
-- things look good. But we have to see and see that the business materializes
and comes through on the P&L. And I think kind of first quarter, we'll see
how things go. And after that, we'll be back to discuss it with you and see
what adjustments we need to make for the year.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. One last one. In your March
investor meeting, can you just maybe describe not what the targets are going to
be, but are you going to give kind of a refreshed longer-term view financially?
Just asking about kind of framework and format, how you guys are going to
approach that.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I kind of felt like I did that
last year, kind of the low to mid-single digit, 30 to 50, that kind of range. I
mean, I think we'll probably -- just to give you a little bit of a preview, I
think you should expect to see something in that similar range going forward.
But yes, I mean, we'll give a refresh on that outlook. I don't know if it's
going to be as precise as laying out every year because I think once you get
out 4 or 5 years, I think it's a little bit more unknown and if we go through a
recession or something, you end up kind of not looking so smart. But I think
the kind of framework that we provided in last year's March will be -- is kind
of should be your expectation for this year.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with
UBS.

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER, MD & INDUSTRIALS ANALYST, UBS
INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: So Darius, maybe just talk a little bit
about the key messages and the difference for managers, the [HS] elements of
leadership meeting that you just had. I know you mentioned cash, but just a
little more on sort of how you're kind of steer -- trying to steer the ship and
give folks priorities as they think about 2018.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Sure. Yes, no. First of all, the key
message was that I thanked them for a really nice 2017. I think we had a very
nice year across the board and I think it was a good time to recognize the kind
of outstanding efforts that the team contributed. So that was sort of the first
key message. In terms of priorities for 2018, I'd say two- or threefold. Number
one, working capital, I talked about that. We want to drive free cash flow. We
want to drive free cash flow conversion. I just want to emphasize, too, that
this is sort of where a very healthy and well-funded pension plan is actually
hurting us from a cash flow conversion perspective, and I always emphasize that
because that somehow gets forgotten. The second point is software, and software
not just in our connected enterprise and our connected, but really the
incorporation of software into anything and everything we do, so software and
sensor strategy for any and all products that Honeywell launches. And the third
one was much more about innovation, making sure that we leverage the latest and
greatest technologies available in the marketplace today and making certain
that those are reflected in our NPD pipelines and so on. And then the last one
is that we've kind of had a bit of a -- we have different behaviors that we're
trying to incorporate in the company and reemphasize leveraging and exhibiting
those behaviors in everything we do. So those were some of the key messages
from our senior leadership meeting.

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER: All right, that's helpful. And then,
secondly, as you think about the kind of follow-on effects of tax reform for
your customer base and their decisions about how to spend that money and
whether or not that kind of works its way back to your own growth rate, and
your own decisions even, what -- I'm really seeing kind of mixed messages out
there from corporates in terms of what they see in their own customer base kind
of considering additional spending that's just sort of macro related versus
maybe tax related. I'm not sure it matters. But maybe a few thoughts on that
potential for acceleration.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: I think, for us, undoubtedly, this is a
very constructive outcome. I mean, we were supportive of tax reform. We're very
pleased with what ended up happening. I think it's going to be good for U.S.
business. For us, we certainly see much greater level of bullishness on the
part of our customers, which should translate to continued investment. And
you're right, their CapEx is our revenue and we do expect some level of
investment to accelerate. Now I think it's a little bit early. I think we
sometimes forget that the details of this are still becoming clear. It's only
30 days old and what the implications are for us. I mean, for us, we've been
bullishly investing in the U.S. already. I mean, if you think about our
elevated CapEx that's been in place for the last 2 to 3 years, a lot of that
investment went into manufacturing jobs, particularly in states like Louisiana
and others. In addition, we're aggressively hiring a lot of software engineers,
particularly in our Atlanta COE, and we're going to continue to do that. So we
have and we'll continue to invest in the U.S. Now will this -- longer term as
we assess further investments, will this -- does this make U.S. a more
appealing place to invest? Absolutely. We think that this is -- this makes the
U.S. a much more appealing place to invest and as we contemplate further
investment, U.S. will be near the top of the list.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, just to add a little color on that,
Steve. When you look at the momentum that we have in the U.S., I mean, overall,
we closed the year out 3% organic growth or so in the region, but the fourth
quarter was pushing close to double digits. So I think there was some
anticipation of what was coming, possibly. And we'll see how that goes. I mean,
so far, so good on -- at this early point in January as we look forward. But
it's hard to make that direct connection between the benefits from the
legislation, including the expensing of CapEx, and our order rates. But we're
looking for it, for sure.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with
Citi.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ, MD AND U.S. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR HEAD,
CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Darius or Tom, we know you have more
difficult growth comparisons in Aero moving forward, but you did 5% growth in
4Q and you averaged over 4% in the second half of the year. We've heard some
more positive commentary on business jets that you guys have talked about, a
potential turn toward the end of this year and next year. So how do you look at
the business at this point? Is the 1% to 3% -- I'm sure there's some
conservatism for the usual suspects like Space and maybe TS. But is the overall
environment actually still getting better, would you say, in Aerospace?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think as we discussed, we think the
environment is still getting better. But I think what is also important to note
is that we're coming off a much stronger year, '17, than a weaker year, which
is '16. So all in all, we're still very bullish. And I'm very excited about our
prospects, more excited than going into '17. But nevertheless, the baseline is
a little bit different. In terms of specifics around your question on
Aerospace, yes, I think the framework there on the business jets is similar to
what we've been saying. We expect some level of acceleration, but more likely
in the second half of '18, not early, particularly as some of the new platforms
are launching and deliveries taking place. So I'd I say cautious optimism
reflected in the growth rates, but probably more later rather than sooner given
the year.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ: Appreciate that, Darius. And then you
mentioned that you're seeing short-cycle growth in Process Solutions. In
December, you suggested you really hadn't seen any evidence of bigger projects
coming back, but you guys see the same things that we do, tax reform and Brent
oil prices being very high. Do you have any expectation that larger projects
could begin to come back? Or are you seeing any signs of them yet as we sit
here today?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think, overall, our
pipelines are very strong. I think you have to remember that our PMT backlog is
up 10% on a year-over-year basis and we had positive orders growth in both UOP
and HPS in Q4. But I would tell you also the pipeline and the project pipeline
is strong. And I think what's important in terms of the price of oil is
sustainability, is that -- what we don't like to see is it bouncing around. So
to the extent that it stays at this level, is right around, is a very healthy
environment for investment. So as long as this is sustained, I become that much
more bullish on our outlook in PMT, particularly UOP and HPS.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with
Melius Research.

SCOTT REED DAVIS, FOUNDING PARTNER, CHAIRMAN, CEO &
RESEARCH ANALYST OF MULTI-INDUSTRY RESEARCH, MELIUS RESEARCH LLC: I asked this
question of a couple of other corps. I haven't really gotten an answer that
seems helpful yet, and I'll throw it at you guys. I mean, this new tax act
thing seems to have somewhat made it simpler to do tax planning globally, that
maybe creates an opportunity for you guys to unwind some structures that were
created in the past, that -- whether it's supply chain related or otherwise. Is
there a cost benefit at all from this simplification? I mean, you guys probably
have like 700 different corporate entities or something crazy like that, right?
So is there any chance that you can unwind some of that stuff and just create
some (inaudible)?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: You got some inside information there. Yes
-- no, I think, Scott, it's funny. If you could see us in the room, I'm
actually smiling at Anne Madden because that's actually -- I think your point
is spot on. I mean, I think -- what I think is underestimated today is that
there is an opportunity to simplify a lot of our legal entities. That is an
effort that actually we've already launched. Anne is leading that effort. But I
also think that something that's underestimated is the level of complexity in
this new tax structure in terms of versus -- where we're going versus where we
are today. So I applaud the new tax code and we think it's extremely helpful
for U.S. business. But it will require us to restructure ourselves and we do
believe that new structure longer term will be simplified, will cost us less,
will make it a lot easier to do business. Can I quantify that for you right
now? I can't because I mean, we literally just started that work a couple of
weeks ago. But I do anticipate it'll be a source of value for Honeywell and our
shareholders.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: Okay, good. That's the only good answer
I've gotten so far. I wanted to ask about business jets in the context of this
Tax Act, too, in that you've got all this money coming back and, seemingly, it
doesn't seem like anybody's bought a business jet in a while. I mean, you guys
have always had really good forecasters who were known for a long time as being
the best source for a business jet forecast. What are your guides saying? And
if you commented on this earlier and I missed it when I went out for coffee,
sorry, but what are your guides saying as far as the potential impact on guys
having a few extra bucks sitting around and buying some planes?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think probably the right answer is
it's a little bit too early to tell because we'd like to see that reflected in
kind of the order rates on the part of our business jet customers. But one
would have to believe that this should have a positive impact on the overall
demand. I think for now we're kind of sticking to what we said before, is that
we anticipate some uptick in the second half of this year and stronger
environment in 2019. But like I said, I think it's just a little bit too early
to tell the real impact. The new tax code is 30 days old and difficult to
project at this point the impact it could have. But sort of logic would tell
you it should be an up arrow for us.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, I think the other thing we have
going is the mandates and some of the software aftermarket offerings that we do
in -- on the business jet side. So even though OEM might not be clicking away
at double digits, we certainly are getting new technology investments for
existing platforms.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with
Cowen and Company.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY,
LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions. First, I just wanted to ask, given tax
reform, how does it change, if at all, the profile of the types of acquisitions
you're looking at? Does it encourage you to go bigger? Does it do anything to
the criteria that you've set out earlier?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: I don't know that it dramatically changes
it. I think given with our -- maybe the only thing that's certainly very
helpful for us is that with the ability to bring back some more cash to the
U.S., it certainly makes U.S.-based acquisitions a bit easier to execute
because now we have got more access to cash. But in terms of focus or -- I
think our financial metrics are set up such that the hurdles are a bit --
adjustments in the tax rates would be reflected in the financial metrics we
look at. So does it dramatically change the calculus? I'm not sure, other than
we have -- we'll have more firepower in the U.S., which is important and it's
important to have that kind of flexibility.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, I would add to that, though, that
we've not really been constrained in where we're looking. Like, our M&A
team and the businesses aren't saying -- haven't been saying, well, let's not
look in the U.S. because we don't have cash. We've always been able to
accommodate that with our capital structure and that will continue to be the
case even more so now.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA: Okay, I appreciate that. And just one
follow-up. Darius, how do you keep this -- the potential SpinCos kind of
focused ahead of the spin? What kind of -- just to make sure that everyone
keeps their eye on the ball and doesn't get distracted as they move into the
new world on their own.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. So I mean, I think both through sort
of our attention. We view these as our businesses before and after the spin. I
mean, I think it's -- we want to make sure that these are incredibly
successful. We have very focused management teams in both the spins businesses.
They're doing a great job in running their businesses, but also getting ready
for the spins. We have a very -- I'm very confident that the teams in those
businesses are focused on delivering now and after the spins take place. So I
think the proper -- there's also proper incentives that are aligned to the
success before and after the spin as well, which we've taken care of and put in
place.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Gautam, this is not an effort that's
being done in some far-flung part of the company. The team, the SpinCo team
that's executing on the transactions actually reports into Darius and I
directly. We do involve the businesses being spun, but we want them focused,
for the most part, on executing on their operating plans and that's the way
we've structured it. The 2 objectives of the spin team are, one, day 1
readiness for those organizations, and we have a very a strong cadence and
operating system around that in terms of systems, in terms of people and staffing
and doing all the regulatory filings and so forth. So that's very rigorous.
Secondly, it's stranded costs. And with 20% of the revenues from the RemainCo
going with the spin, we need to rightsize the company, and so that SpinCo
leadership team also is in the process of managing that cost structure. So
Darius and I get regular weekly visibility to it. We've put on some of the most
senior people in Honeywell to do this, and we're encouraged by the progress
they're making.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, and I think, just add to it, I mean,
we have a full-blown what we call de-integration team, which is staffed by
senior leaders whose full-time job is nothing but to focus on making certain
that we have a successful spin in place and execute the business in the near term.
So we have the right level of focus on this.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Peter Arment with
Baird.

PETER J. ARMENT, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD
& CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Darius, just a quick one, sticking
in the Aerospace. Obviously, the United Airlines' selection, that was certainly
very favorable for you guys, but just kind of talking about the competitive
landscape. We're months into this deal with one of your bigger competitors, and
certainly the headline reads that it would be more competition for you. But at
the same time, seems like there's going to be a lot of opportunity. What are
your guys hearing in terms of your sense of, post this merger, that you'll see
other opportunities for growth?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, Peter, we haven't been really
focused on the merger of others. I think what we've really been focused on is
executing our strategy. I continue to be extraordinarily excited about our
vision for Connected Aircraft. I think it's industry-leading. It's reflected in
our rates, certainly been a factor in the United win and we're getting more and
more traction every day. And I feel good because we have -- if you think about
the real estate and the scope on an aircraft, we have the avionics and we have
mechanical systems and we have an integrated play and integrated our offering.
I think we have a very compelling vision for the kind of value we can create
for aircraft owners, maintainers, passengers, pilots, create a more efficient,
more safe experience for everybody. And that's not visionary, that's not a
dream. That's something that we're executing, selling and generating revenue in
today and we feel that's a very unique place to be in, in the aerospace
industry, and frankly, we're the only ones that are executing it. I think
probably our biggest opportunity or challenge at the same time is just being
able to communicate that clearly in that value to end customers. But as you can
tell by some of these wins, we're doing that more and more effectively.

PETER J. ARMENT: Okay, that's helpful color. And just a
quick one, Tom. Just the sensitivity around -- for your Defense business with
the CR impacts, how do we think about that? Is there any near-term impact? Or
what's the right way to think?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Well, thankfully, we've got another
reprieve, but it's kind of one of those things that's more timing than anything
else. There's a slight risk that volumes push out depending on shutdowns and so
forth, but I think we're -- I don't think we are anticipating any significant
adverse impacts from those activities.

OPERATOR: And our final question comes from Andrew Obin with
Bank of America.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN, MD, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Just a question. The focus on the economy was all in the U.S., but
European macro metrics are actually looking better than the U.S. right now, so
is China. Can you just talk about what you guys are seeing in Europe and what
you guys are seeing in China and other emerging markets? And specifically on
China, if you're seeing any signs of deceleration. We've been getting a lot of
questions from investors on that.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes -- no. I mean, we -- we're extremely
bullish on China. It was an absolutely terrific year for us in China. I mean, I
think close to a 30% organic growth rate in China last year. And could there be
a slight downtick from that rate? Maybe, but we continue to see double-digit
and planning on double-digit growth rate in China for us. So we're bullish
there.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: And that was every...

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Every business. Every business grew and I
think we really kind of figured out the calculus as to how to be successful in
China, acting like a local company. Our whole value chain now is localized. And
the great news and the one that I'm really excited about is we made similar
progress in India. So I think we're really firing on all cylinders in China and
India. Back to your Europe question, we're also bullish on Europe. I mean,
Europe is continuing to grow. We're seeing growth in Western Europe. Not seeing
a lot of trouble spots here. So as we head into this '18, as I said, I'm
continuing to be bullish on a global basis in terms of our prospects for
growth. So overall, strong environment.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: Just to follow up on your Aero '18
outlook. You said on the call that none of your businesses are going to be
negative, but just sort of this 1% to 3% growth does imply that perhaps
Commercial OE is negative on wide-body deliveries. How should I think about
sort of sub-segments within Aero?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Well, I think, number one, is that the
aftermarket and the services business are going to continue to be strong. Both
are sort of what I call the proactive segment as well as the brake fix. Sort of
we talked about the business jet OE, which is -- our plan is that acceleration
as we get deeper into the year. And on the narrow-bodies, I mean, obviously,
this is going to be really aggressive growth for our customers. So that's sort
of a rough framework that we're planning for in 2018.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: So none of them within your framework --
none of the sub-segments are negative into '18?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: No.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: I mean, on the OE side, we'll continue at
low single-digit kind of growth, all-in, is the plan. I mean, that could change
quarter-to-quarter, vary quarter-to-quarter based on customer delivery
schedules, but I think we're planning on an overall Commercial OE growth rate
in that range.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: So just similar level of conservatism
across your guidance.

OPERATOR: And that concludes today's question-and-answer
session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius
Adamczyk for any additional or closing remarks.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Thank you. We've begun 2018 with
significant momentum, including strong order rates, a growing backlog and
favorable U.S. tax legislation. We are excited by our prospects, both the near
term and long term, as Honeywell continue to outperform. I'm looking forward to
speaking to you next at our Annual Investor Conference Day on February 19 here
in Morris Plains. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. This does conclude today's
teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful
day.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
Honeywell's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As
a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's
conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank
you, Christina. Good morning. Welcome to Honeywell's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings
Conference Call. With me here today are President and CEO, Darius Adamczyk; and
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek.

This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP
reconciliations, are available on our website at 

. Note that elements of this
presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view
of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can
change, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the
principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our annual
report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.

This morning, we'll review our financial results for the third
quarter, share our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. And as
always, we'll leave ample time at the end for your questions.

So with that, I'll turn the call over to President and CEO,
Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK, PRESIDENT, CEO & DIRECTOR, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As we
previewed last week, Honeywell delivered another terrific quarter with strong
organic sales growth and margin expansion, leading to high-quality earnings.

Sales were up 5% exceeding the high end of the guidance we
provided in July. Our Aerospace aftermarket business grew more than 7%. Our
Intelligrated business, which develops solutions for the warehouse automation
market, continued to grow at double-digit pace. And every business in
Performance Materials and Technologies grew considerably, led by 25% organic
sales growth in UOP.

In addition, we saw continued strength in high growth
regions. Organic sales growth in both China and India was up more than 30%
year-over-year, driven by strong catalyst demand in UOP and continued growth
from our differentiated offering within Home and Building Technologies and
Safety and Productivity Solutions.

We expanded segment margins by 120 basis points this
quarter, driven by strong operational performance in all businesses, leading to
earnings per share that came in at the high end of our guidance range at $1.75,
up 16% on a basis consistent with our guidance.

During the quarter, we also funded about $120 million of
restructuring and other projects. We remain on track to achieving our full year
free cash flow guidance. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.2 billion,
representing about 90% conversion. I am encouraged by the progress we made with
regard to working capital, but there is much more we can do, and all of our
businesses are focused on driving improvements to our cash cycle.

Overall, I'm pleased with our organic sales growth momentum
and the operational improvement each of our businesses continue to achieve. As
a result of our continued outperformance, last week, we raised our full year
earnings per share guidance to $7.05 to $7.10, up 9% to 10%. As you will hear
shortly, this morning, we also raised our full year sales guidance to reflect
the stronger top line performance. Tom will walk you through those updates in a
few minutes.

As most of you may recall, last week announced the spins of
Homes and Transportation Systems. As independent companies, Homes and
Transportation Systems will be better positioned to make tailored strategic and
capital decisions that will enable long-term value creation. At the same time,
these actions will make Honeywell a more focused, growth-oriented and
synergistic company, putting us in a better position to continue to deliver the
results you've come to expect from us. I am pleased with this quarter's results
and looking forward to a strong finish to 2017.

Let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss some of the commercial
progress our businesses made in the third quarter. In Aerospace, we launched
the new unmanned aerial vehicle inspection service called Honeywell InView. The
service will help customers in the utility, energy, infrastructure and oil and
gas industries improve critical structure inspections while eliminating safety
hazards for employees. InView combines the proven performance of Intel's Falcon
8+ UAV system and Honeywell's varied and extensive expense across verticals
with data-driven software that will help customers log, analyze and eventually
predict or prevent outages and structural failures. We're excited about this
unique combination of cutting-edge aeronautics with software and data.

In Home and Building Technologies, Kuala Lumpur
International Airport, one of Asia's major aviation hubs, selected Honeywell
Building Solutions to upgrade its airfield ground lighting control and
monitoring system. The Honeywell system will enhance safety and efficiency
while accommodating increasing aircraft traffic. Honeywell's technology will
provide real-time location information on light failures to optimize response
and repair, promoting enhanced operations and improved uptime.

Performance Materials and Technologies announced that Kuwait
Paraxylene Production Co. will use Honeywell Connected Plant services to
improve performance at its CCR Platforming and aromatics complex, which
produces a precursor to plastic fibers and films. KPPC will use Honeywell
Connected Plant's Process Reliability Advisor for ongoing monitoring, early
event detection and mitigation of performance issues before they become costly.
The company will also use Process Optimization Advisor, which continuously
monitors streaming plant data and applies Honeywell UOP process models to
determine the most cost-effective method mode of operations. Both services use
Big Data analytics and machine learning to improve plant operation. We
continued to deliver results for our customers through our Connected Plant
offerings, and I'm pleased with the traction we've been gaining in this area.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, you'll recall our
efforts to develop mobile computing offerings for Google's Android operating
system, which is quickly becoming the standard for industrial handheld devices.
I'm pleased to announce that earlier this week, we launched the Mobility Edge
Platform. Mobility Edge allows users to easily upgrade to future Android
versions more than any competitive offerings in the market, making it easier
for customers to manage device refreshes and quickly deploy apps.

We conducted comprehensive "voice of the customer"
research prior to the development of the Mobile Edge Platform and rethought our
approach to solving customer pain points that come up during our conversations.
The result -- this results in a best-in-class scalable platform that makes
deployments quick and easy for our customers. Clearly, there are a lot of
exciting things happening across the portfolio as we head into 2018.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom to discuss
our results.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK, SENIOR VP & CFO, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thanks, Darius. Good morning. I'm on Slide 4. As Darius
mentioned, we achieved 5% organic sales growth in the third quarter, which
exceeded our guidance of 2% to 4% growth. We've met or exceeded the high end of
our sales guidance in every quarter of 2017, and each of our businesses is
contributing to the momentum.

Segment profit was $1.9 billion, up 13%, excluding the
impact from our 2016 divestitures. And segment margin expanded 120 basis points
from 2016, driven by our continued focus on effective selling and operational
execution.

We also had some favorability from lower OEM incentives in
Aerospace, which was contemplated in our guidance. Earnings per share was
$1.75, in line with our preview on October 10. Our third quarter tax rate came
in at 23.4%, lower than originally anticipated, which enabled additional
restructuring projects beyond what we had planned.

These projects will improve our cost structure, drive
further productivity starting in the fourth quarter and begin to address the
residual costs we expect as a result of the announced spins. Excluding $60
million of this additional restructuring and earnings from our 2016
divestitures, and normalized for tax at 26% in both periods, earnings per share
was up 16% year-over-year.

A number of people have asked about the impact from the
extreme weather throughout the third quarter. The impact from all of the
weather issues was approximately $0.02 of earnings, which we were able to
overcome with advanced planning and other mitigation actions. Each of our
businesses was impacted in some way. We had to temporarily close 6 Aerospace
sites in the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico. Several ADI branches were closed,
leading to lost revenues for Home and Building Technologies. In Process
Solutions, several customers pushed third quarter projects into the fourth
quarter. And SPS experienced lower demand for safety equipment, especially
gas-sensing products, due to refinery maintenance pushouts. We're proud of how
our employees and management team responded and delivered despite these challenges
and are pleased that all of our employees made it through the events safely.
We're in the process of assessing any ongoing impacts to our business.

Free cash flow continues to be strong, growing 18%
year-to-date despite about $200 million more of timing-related cash tax
payments this quarter and about $500 million more year-to-date. As Darius
mentioned, our focus on improving working capital is beginning to deliver
results, and we expect this to continue into 2018 and beyond. Free cash flow
conversion in the third quarter was about 90%, as Darius mentioned. Overall, we
delivered high-quality results, driven by strong operational performance in our
businesses.

Let's turn to Slide 5 for our segment results. Starting with
Aerospace, sales growth was 2 percentage points above the high end of our
guidance. Strength in the commercial aftermarket continued this quarter, with
strong Air Transport & Regional spares and continued demand for retrofits,
modifications and upgrades. The business in general aviation aftermarket was
also up, primarily driven by the timing of customer demand. Overall,
aftermarket sales grew 7%.

OE sales for the quarter were up 10% driven by the impact of
lower year-over-year customer incentives as expected. On the air transport
side, we saw higher demand on key platforms, including the A318, A320 and 737,
strong growth with certain regional OEMs as well.

Sales in Business & General Aviation were better than
anticipated, primarily due to the timing of engines and avionic shipments and accelerated
new platform demand. While we are encouraged by the strong quarter in BGA, the
market is not expected to fully recover until late next year or early in 2019.

Defense & Space sales were down 2% organic, with strong
U.S. core defense sales more than offset by storm-related impacts, supply-based
execution and the anticipated continued weakness in the space and commercial
helicopter markets.

In Transportation Systems, we saw continued growth in
commercial vehicle, particularly for on-highway turbos, driven by increased
vehicle sales in U.S., new launches in Europe and continued enforcement of
vehicle weight regulation in China. Growth in light vehicle gas turbos in China
was again strong.

Aerospace segment margin expansion of 290 basis points for
the quarter was driven by lower year-over-year customer incentives, as we
signaled; commercial excellence, including the impact of our investments in the
sales force; the benefit from ongoing productivity initiative and the favorable
impact of the 2016 divestiture of the government services business.

Home and Building Technologies grew 2%, driven by
distribution and the Smart Energy business within products. The distribution
size of the business was up 2% primarily on the strength in our ADI business.
Backlog in the Honeywell Building Solutions business was up over 20% in the
quarter, with every region reporting double-digit increases and every line of
business up year-over-year. Within the products businesses, we continued to
execute several large smart meter program rollouts and saw continued strong
demand for clean air and water products in China. Segment margin for HBT
expanded 10 basis points, driven by benefits from commercial excellence and our
ongoing productivity initiative, partially offset by continued unfavorable mix,
both within the products businesses and between products and distribution.

Performance Materials and Technologies had another
outstanding quarter, with organic sales up 10% and 170 basis points of margin
expansion. There is broad strength across the PMT businesses. UOP sales were up
25% with every line of business achieving double-digit year-over-year
increases, including strong licensing, equipment, catalysts and gas processing
volumes. There was good growth in megaprojects in China, strong catalyst reload
volumes in India and Asia Pac and new unit growth in the Middle East.

In HPS, sales were up 5% with significant growth in the
short cycle software and services businesses as well as in thermal solutions.
Advanced Materials had another quarter of strong growth, driven by continued
demand for Solstice low-global-warming products. Orders and backlog were up
high single digits across the entire PMT portfolio. Margin expansion in PMT
came in at the high end of our guidance range, driven by the volume leverage
from PMT's exceptional sales growth, results from our commercial excellence
effort and the divestiture of the former Resins and Chemicals business last
year.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, organic sales were up
3%. Intelligrated booked a record amount of orders in the third quarter and had
another quarter of 20% sales growth, driven by strong demand from large
customers.

Workflow solutions recorded double-digit growth this quarter
with significant demand coming from existing customers of our Vocollect
voice-enabled solutions as well as large project rollout for a key European
customer within our Movilizer software business.

In Sensing and IoT, demand for our sensing, controls and new
sensor products remain strong, with control in all -- with growth in all
regions, particularly in high-growth regions like China. In productivity
products, we saw double-digit growth within our scanning business as well as
robust demand for printers. And as Darius mentioned, we're working to address
the Android-based gaps in our mobility product line. We anticipate that we'll
see the impact of our new Android launches next year.

Finally, safety grew 1% on an organic basis, driven by
demand for our high-risk and general safety personal protective equipment offerings.
Again, we were modestly impacted in safety by the hurricanes in the quarter,
mostly in the gas sensing line and fully expect a recovery in the fourth
quarter.

SPS segment margins expanded 190 basis points, excluding the
first year dilutive impacts from M&A, primarily driven by higher volumes,
continued productivity and restructuring benefits, and partially offset by
investments in commercial excellence. A great third quarter performance across
all the businesses, as Darius mentioned, while overcoming unanticipated impacts
from the weather-related disruptions.

Slide 6 walks our earnings per share from the third quarter
of 2016 to the third quarter of 2017. Earnings from our divestitures in the
third quarter were approximately $0.04 per share in 2016. We exclude those
amounts from the 2016 baseline, consistent with our guidance framework. For
comparison purposes, we've also normalized the tax rate for the third quarter
of 2016 to the 26% effective tax rate we assumed in our third quarter guidance,
the impact of which was $0.05 per share.

As you can see, the overwhelming majority of our earnings
growth is coming from segment profit improvement in the business, with all 4
segments contributing to the growth, led by Aerospace. This reflects the impacts
from the strong top line in the quarter as well as our commercial excellence
efforts and HOS Gold deployment and savings from previously executed
restructuring projects.

Below the line items were a $0.02 headwind this quarter,
primarily due to the absence of the third quarter 2016 gain from the sale of
our former Aerospace government services business, partially offset by slightly
lower restructuring expense year-over-year. In the third quarter, we funded
nearly $120 million of restructuring, which was partially enabled by a
lower-than-planned tax rate at approximately 23%. Other items, including
noncontrolling interest, share count and tax were roughly flat year-over-year.

Let's turn to Slide 7 for our expectations on the fourth
quarter. In Aerospace, organic sales are expected to be up 1% to 3%. In
commercial OE, we expect roughly flat sales growth in total, driven by strong
air transport deliveries, partially offset by the impact of declining shipments
on legacy air transport platforms and slight declines in bizjet OE. We
anticipate modest growth in the business aviation aftermarket on the timing of
customer demand for spares and expect the air transport aftermarket to be
roughly flat, driven by increased repair and overhaul activities, offset by the
timing of spares demand.

In defense, we have a healthy backlog and expect continued
strength in U.S. core defense, partially offset by ongoing space weakness.
Demand for gas turbos in Europe is expected to drive low to mid-single-digit
growth in transportation systems. Aerospace margins should expand by 70 to 90
basis points this quarter, driven by volume leverage, commercial excellence,
restructuring benefits and productivity net of inflation.

In HBT, we anticipate organic sales growth of 2% to 3%.
Within the products businesses, growth in Smart Energy will continue, albeit at
a slower pace as we move past the large smart meter rollouts we executed in the
second and third quarters.

We also anticipate improvement within Security and Fire.
Security was improved each quarter in 2017, and we expect that to continue as a
result of new product introductions and commercial excellence.

In distribution, the strong Building Solutions backlog I
mentioned earlier, combined with the continued strength in the global distribution
business, will drive low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter.

HBT segment margins are expected to contract 10 to 30 basis
points, driven by continued headwinds from product mix, partially offset by
savings from prior restructuring action and ongoing commercial excellence and
productivity initiatives. As a reminder, Smart Energy was recently moved from
HBT to Performance Materials and Technologies, and their results will be
including in PMT's results beginning with the fourth quarter earnings. Before
our December outlook call, we expect to file Form 8-K with the SEC to restate
the 2016 and 2017 quarterly segment results to reflect this movement of the
Smart Energy business.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales are
expected to be up 10% to 12% on an organic basis, driven by continued
conversion to sales of our strong backlog. UOP is expected to deliver another
quarter of strong growth, driven by natural gas recovery projects in the UOP
Russell business in Russia and North America as well as strong initial catalyst
load in the Middle East. We expect mid-single-digit growth in HPS with
significant demand for our thermal solutions and field instruments. In Advanced
Materials, we expect double-digit growth, fueled primarily by our Solstice refrigerants
for mobile air-conditioning.

PMT segment margins are expected to contract 110 to 120
basis points, driven by an unfavorable mix of equipment versus catalyst sale in
UOP year-over-year. In the fourth quarter of 2016, PMT had catalyst growth of
17%, which fueled expansion of more than 500 basis points of margin. Even so
for the full year, we expect PMT will still generate 140 basis points of margin
expansion, truly an outstanding year.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales are expected to
be up 5% to 7% on an organic basis. In the safety business, we expect robust
growth as refinery maintenance resumes following the hurricane-related impacts
in the third quarter, which will drive demand for our entire range of safety
products. We expect that the retail business will return to growth this quarter
as we execute the new direct-selling strategy in that business and expect we'll
see normal elevated seasonal demand.

Growth in productivity products will be driven by another
strong quarter at Intelligrated, building on the robust orders and backlog
growth throughout 2017 as well as continued strong demand for the Sensing and
Controls business and workflow solutions, including Vocollect and Movilizer.
SPS margins are expected to expand by 110 to 130 basis points, driven primarily
by higher volumes and the results from our ongoing productivity and
repositioning effort.

For Honeywell in total, we expect another strong quarter of
organic sales growth and 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion, leading to
earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.84. We expect that our fourth quarter
effective tax rate will be about 21%, with the full year closer to 22%. We
intend to undertake additional restructuring projects, as we have the past 2
quarters, enabled by this expected lower fourth quarter effective tax rate.

The difference between the organic and sales projections you
see on this page is primarily due to the stronger U.S. dollar.

On M&A, we've lapped the impacts of our 2 big
divestitures, the Aerospace government service business and the Resins and
Chemicals business, as well as the impact of the Intelligrated acquisition. Our
fourth quarter and full year guidance does not contemplate significant cost to
prepare our Homes and Transportation Systems businesses for the spins we
announced last week. We're working to define those costs and work streams, and
we'll provide more details as we progress.

Let's move to Slide 8. Last week, we raised the low end of
our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 to $7.05 to $7.10 per share, up 9% to 10%.
This growth excludes the impact of 2016 divestitures, fourth quarter 2016 debt
refinancing charges and the pension mark-to-mark adjustment. Based on current
discount rates and asset return assumptions as of September 30, we do not expect
the 2017 pension mark-to-mark adjustment to be significant. We're raising our
full year sales guidance to a new range of $40.2 billion to $40.4 billion, up
3% to 4% organic and up 2% to 3% reported. This new range reflects stronger
sales performance and outlooks in Aerospace and Performance Materials and
Technologies. You can see the revised sales guidance on the right side of the
page.

We remain within the initial guidance for the segment margin
and have narrowed our estimate to about 19%, which is up 70 basis points
year-over-year. There's no change to our full year free cash flow guidance. The
year-to-date free cash flow performance has been good, and each of our
businesses continues to remain focused on improving our working capital
execution.

Let me turn to Slide 10 for a quick wrap-up. The third
quarter marked another strong performance for Honeywell with each of our
segments meeting or beating their commitments. We had outstanding sales
performance and robust orders and backlog growth across the businesses that
will help fuel continued growth. We expect to finish the year strong with
fourth quarter organic sales growth between 4% and 6% and earnings per share of
$1.79 to $1.84.

For the year, we raised our sales guidance to a new range of
$40.2 billion to $40.4 billion and reaffirm the new earnings per share guidance
range we provided last week, $7.05 to $7.10 per share. We continue to make
investments to drive future profitable growth as well as to begin to eliminate
the residual costs we expect as a result of the announced spins of the Homes
and Transportation Systems businesses.

At Honeywell, we're committed to driving shareholder value.
That means optimizing our portfolio, as we announced last week, but that also
means remaining focused on delivering outstanding results on growth,
productivity and cash flow every quarter of every year.

With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.

MARK MACALUSO: Thanks, Tom. Darius and Tom and I are
available to answer your questions. So Christina, if you could, please open the
line for Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is
coming from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC,
RESEARCH DIVISION: And I'm sorry, I signed on late, so you may have covered
some of this before. One of the follow-up points I had on the spin
announcements, divestiture announcements earlier was the potential for -- and
the use of the Honeywell brand for the divested businesses. Just it's kind of a
cleanup question on that announcement, and I'd start there, please.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Sure. Yes. I think as it relates to the
Honeywell brand, some of those decisions have not been made in terms of how
we're going to -- what we're going to do with the brand for either the Homes or
the Transportation Systems business. So I think that we'll provide more clarity
on that as we move forward. But there are a lot of different options that we
have, and it's going to be part of our work product moving forward. We'll be
communicating that as it becomes clearer in Q1 and Q2 of next year.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: And how about just a broader question on
a progress report and goals for the transformation of Honeywell to the software
industrial, Darius, that you envision? Just in terms of portfolio shaping, the
way you're looking at M&A, emphasizing perhaps some Software-as-a-Service
opportunities within the portfolio.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Sure. No, I -- overall, I'm very pleased in
terms of how our Connected Enterprises is progressing this year. It's up double
digit, which is very much in line with expectations. Margins are up even higher
than that. In terms of acquisitions and landscape there, we continue to look at
all segments of the business, including our software plays. We've made one acquisition
actually in the software area in Q3, which is a pretty exciting cybertechnology
that, although the business itself is relatively small, we have very, very big
growth opportunities for it. And it's actually exceeding our expectations.

So the software acquisitions in general will be more of the
bolt-on variety. That -- those are the kind that we're looking at. But overall,
continue to make progress both on the P&L on Connected Enterprise, continue
to make progress on the buildout of our Sentience platform and signing up more
partners as we go. So we continue to be very excited about what we're doing.
And the most important part of that is generating the right kind of results.

DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: Got it. And just last question, I know
we're going to hear more of this in your outlook call. But broad strokes, the
outlook on 2018 in terms of the macro environment, where do you think you're
particularly well positioned, both U.S., outside the U.S.?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, Dean, this is Tom. We're in the throes
of our planning right now. We'll go through the details as we get into
November, December. We're looking at trends continuing in most of our
businesses. I mean, you see the strength in Aerospace, a lot of good flight
hour activity. The defense is looking up. And with any luck, at some point in
the tail end of '18, we'll get some help from the business jet side. Although
business jet usage remains strong. So we expect those trends to continue.

PMT, we really are encouraged, not only by their performance
but by the strength of the orders and backlog, and it's been in all lines of
business. I mean, not to denigrate last year, but we had great orders last
year. They're in the aftermarket side. We're seeing a lot of front-end orders
type business in PMT, particularly in UOP and HPS, which bodes well for
building installed base and building that service business. So really strong
trends there in SPS. Intelligrated continues to perform very well. We expect
that backlog, which is well over 20%, to fuel excellent growth. And we expect
the trends in that vertical to continue with e-commerce.

And the safety business continues to do well. We've got the
Android products on productivity and the software businesses and SPS. So good
trends. You saw our fourth quarter expected growth, and I think we'll see that
continue into next year. So overall, I see some trends, some growth trends
continuing. Dean, as you saw every quarter of this year, the organic growth
rate has improved. And if our guidance holds up into -- in the fourth quarter,
that should at least be equal to third quarter. And hopefully, that continues
into next year. So overall, pretty strong conditions we had. We're encouraged.

OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker
with UBS.

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER, INDUSTRIALS ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT
BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Darius, could you maybe expand a little bit on your
thoughts around PMT and UOP in terms of that refining cycle? It's giving you a
lot of -- I mean, overall, the tailwinds top line. I know you've got equipment
challenges. But the cyclical versus structural side of this, what are you kind
of expecting given Tom's comment for the length of tailwind in that one -- that
very important segment?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Well, Steve, as Tom pointed out, one of the
most important things for that business we always watch is the bookings. It is
very much a long cycle. Bookings are -- backlog's up. It's going to -- we know
for a fact it's going to be up probably double digit by the end of this year
versus the end of last year. We continue to be bullish. We're winning a lot of
work.

And we're particularly winning a lot of work in our
high-growth regions, which I find to be really important. Because as you think
about where PMT needs to be strong and has to be strong is in the development
and progress of a lot of the developing regions, and it's exactly where it's
winning. So its win rate in China, India, markets such as this, give me a great
deal of comfort, is that it's going to continue to perform. Our backlog position
is strong, and we expect another strong quarters of booking in Q4 and go into
2018 with a strong position.

And the good news is, we're kind of seeing it across all the
segment, whether it's our gas processing business, whether it's the catalyst
business, all of those have been particularly strong. And by the way, enjoyed
the biggest order ever in Q3 in terms of our catalyst orders. So overall,
things are very much moving in the right direction for all of PMT, but
especially UOP.

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER: That's helpful. On SPS, I think you had
about a month -- you had a month of Intelligrated in that 3% organic. Let me
know if that's about right and...

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: That's right. That's correct.

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER: So ex Intelligrated, which you said was
up more than 20, the rest of that business must have been down, I don't know,
say low to mid-single digits or something. Maybe give a little color on that
and the -- maybe it is on the mobility productivity side, but just a better
understanding of the organic performance ex Intelligrated there.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. It's actually good. There's growth in
every business. The only business where we didn't see growth was productivity
products, and that's due to some of the challenges we previously communicated
around the mobility platform. Because if we look at the scanning side of the
business, it was actually up close to 20%. So we have one small area, which is
challenged, and the productivity products business is challenged. But as we
just announced, we've had a exciting new product launch this week. We have more
coming in the middle of November and another set of new product launches in the
mobility segment coming in the middle of February.

So we're not where we want to be on mobility in productivity
products, but I'm very confident that business, as we head into 2018 and Q1 and
Q2, is going to start turning that performance around as it launches these new
offerings. But overall, a very strong performance across the board by SPS,
other than the one issue we knew about, and we weren't particularly surprised
about the outcome.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, not to mention overcoming the storms
and hurricanes in the safety business, in particular. I mean, as you know the
oil and gas vertical is a big sector, and there was a lot of pushouts of
projects and activity that affected the -- particularly the gas monitoring
business in safety. But overall, the trends there are really strong, as Darius
said.

STEVEN ERIC WINOKER: Actually, numbers are -- it's up 1%
though, right, ex Intelligrated, Tom? So it was positive still.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Absolutely, yes. No, no, Steve, I'm not
saying that the numbers ex Intelligrated were up 1%. I mean, as Darius said,
every one of the business was strong. It wasn't just Intelligrated that was
contributing more than 2% to 3%.

OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with
JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: It's nice to be able to get on calls and ask questions. Just first
question. You guys, you recently raised your dividend by how much?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: 12%.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: 12%, Steve.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: And the commitment is continue to do
and drive that faster than earnings going forward for the next few years?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: The commitment that we've made that
Darius talked about at the -- at his Investor Day -- at our Investor Day was
continuing for the 5-year plan with the idea of raising the dividend faster
than the earnings growth. And we're coming up to the end of that. As we look
forward, we'll watch that. But at a minimum, we're committing to keep the
dividend growth in line with earnings growth. It'll track earnings for sure.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Steve, just to answer that. Yes. So as we
said, as Dave committed for the 5-year period, which ends in 2018, we're going
to grow dividends on a pace that's faster than earnings. We're committed to
that. It's consistent with what we said 5 years ago. For the period after that,
what I would say is it's going to be equal to or greater than earnings. And
we'll provide greater clarity on that in our February Investor Day. But I'd
expect to be equal to or greater than.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Right. And you guys have free cash
flow, so we can talk about that. At the -- how do you -- seasonally, it kind of
suggests that your cash should be kind of towards the higher end of the range.
Just remind us what the target is for 100%. Is that for '18 or '19?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. Steve, the way I talked about that
at the Investor Day and largely sticking to it is that by -- in run rate '18,
but really in 2019, we expect to be at 100%.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. And then just one last question.
Math is clearly not a strong suit or prerequisite for being on the sell side.
But the math around Safety and Productivity Solutions, I was getting to
something a little different, like maybe 1%, 1.5% growth in the core business.
And with your new Android product that's coming in, would you expect that kind
of core growth? I mean, not that it really matters because Intelligrated is an
organic grower that has tremendous orders. So I'm not sure why we're picking
that apart in the first place. But would you expect that to get better next
year as some of these new products come into the fray in safety and productivity?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, absolutely. I mean, we expect much
improved growth rate in productivity products next year as these new products
launch and gain traction. And I probably expect it to accelerate a bit through
the quarters because the bulk of our launches are coming in Q4 and Q1. So
obviously, it takes time to generate the orders. But short answer is yes. And
that's -- I think we continue to talk productivity products. It's one segment
of one business where we had a little bit of a struggle. But across the --
across all the other businesses, it's been a really nice story of both top line
growth and margin expansion.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Yes. I guess people just can't live
without adjusting numbers everywhere, so I can understand why we would do that
for a segment like that. Congrats on the top-tier organic growth and keeping
your eye on the ball.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Thanks, Steve.

OPERATOR: We'll our next question from Gautam Khanna with
Cowen & Company.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY,
LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I was wondering if you could provide your early
perspective on any competitive implications of UTX, Collins. And have you given
any more thought to the whole Boeing avionics initiative and their stated goal
of kind of moving into the aftermarket on the aerospace side.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Sure. Yes. So I mean, I think starting with
Collins and UTX, obviously, something that we've analyzed. But the way we look
at this is the capability that we currently have, both on -- in mechanical
systems as well as avionics, are on par or greater than anything that UTX or
Collins would have in creating that merger. And I'm particularly excited as it
relates to our vision of Connected Aircraft. Because having both the front end
and electronics as well as the mechanical systems really gives you a strength
and capability to implement and deliver that vision of a Connected Aircraft.

And it's not theoretical for us. It's something that we
already have and are delivering, and it's growing double-digit. And we're
marching through the aircraft to get all of our systems connected. We already
have APUs, launched wheels and brakes this quarter, and we're going to be
marching through. So I'm not sure that, that merger puts us any kind of a
disadvantage vis-ÃÂ -vis UTX or Collins. And maybe most importantly, I
never viewed the Aerospace segment as one where scale matters. What matters for
us is technology differentiation. That's going to be our basis for competition.

In terms of the Boeing avionics and services announcement,
clearly, we respect what they're doing. There's not a lot of clarity yet in
terms of exactly what that means and what they'll be doing. Obviously, Boeing
is a highly valued and important customer for us, which we're going to continue
to work with and support. But we also have our own relationship with the end
users, the airlines. And we have a strong vision for growing our services and
RMUs and Connected Aircraft as well. So we're going to be as supportive as we
can to Boeing and stay in sync with them and create a win-win for both
companies.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA: Darius, maybe just a follow-up on M&A.
When you look at the pipeline and some of the portfolio actions you've
announced, are there any larger properties that are attractive to you? Or
should we expect more on the kind of couple billion or Elster-sized bites going
forward? Or are there some (inaudible)?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: There's always things that are attractive,
but I would expect more of the bolt-on variety. That's really our sweet spot,
and that's what we're looking in. I would say our pipeline is filled more with
bolt-on variety type of acquisitions. But you never know, anything could
happen. But I would say I would be more expectant of bolt-ons.

OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from John Inch with
Deutsche Bank.

JOHN GEORGE INCH, MD OF MULTI-INDUSTRY SECTOR OF US AND
SENIOR ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: And I'd also like to echo
Steve Tusa's commentary. It's nice when companies allow questions. So I want to
start, was the...

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: We aim to please.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: So what about pricing? Was there any
discernible trend on pricing? There's a little bit of (inaudible) debate around
raw impacts various companies are calling out. And just curious, I realize you
guys have -- you're not a huge raws, spreads company, but there is a little bit
of impact there. Are spreads improving? Or how should we think about that?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. No. I mean, obviously, we're in a bit
of an inflationary environment for some of the commodities. But one thing I'm
very proud of all our teams in all our businesses, they really stayed on their
toes, made the adjustments, understand what the impacts are and really are
capturing the value that our services and products provide for our customers.
So I think overall, we've probably been more challenged on the cost side this
year than we've seen in a while.

But I also think we've reacted quickly, made the right
adjustments. We have a very active value engineering program as well that
produces substantial productivity. And we also understand the value that we
bring to our customers and make adjustments as required. So all in all, done a
nice job here.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: With respect to drag in the quarter this
year versus last year, if there's a way to kind of capture that.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: No. I think we're -- when you look at the
actual pricing, it's what we talked about last quarter. I mean, it's holding in
there quite nicely, maybe -- 50 to 100 basis points, depending upon the
business, and largely recovering to the types of inflation Darius talked about.
Like he said, the businesses are laser focused on this, particularly on the
material inflation side.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, the other thing, John, I would -- I'd
just point to the fact that every one of our businesses expanded margins in Q3,
on every single one. So -- and we're on that trend for the whole year as well.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: Yes, so that kind of almost leads to the
question of cash. And given all the investments you guys have been putting in,
the new products and so forth and the growth that you anticipate, it's clearly
growth is picking up in PMT and Aerospace. I forget, Darius, you had mentioned
this in kind of the portfolio review call. But what's your sort of line of
sight to Honeywell getting to 100% free cash conversion, if not higher than
that? And where does that kind of rank in your strategic priority list of
things you're trying to accomplish?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. It's important, and we -- that's
exactly what we're aiming is 100%. It's consistent with the messaging we've
been giving. We're marching towards that goal. We're -- we did roughly 90% this
year. We expect to see improvement next year and then further improvement 2019.
It's -- and it's a very conscious call. And I can tell you that we've never had
more focus on working capital than we do today. We're seeing some progress
being made there, and there's more to go. But it's a very important goal, that
goal that both Tom and myself and the rest of the business leaders take very
seriously and we're committed to.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: Lastly is a question to capital
allocation. I mean, you've basically said, "Look, let's think about near
term. We'll think about our foreseeable future bolt-ons." A lot of the stuff
out there is pretty pricey, given what's happened in the public markets. Plus,
Darius, I think a lot of the things that you want to aspire toward improving or
realizing in your mix, software, industrial, et cetera, that stuff's got to be
to be pretty pricey, too. Is the playbook, kind of in the intermediate term,
just we're not going to do a lot of M&A? I mean, what's the -- kind of how
do you judge that balance or gauge that balance? Because you don't want to
overpay, but you don't want to sit and sort of do nothing if the price is
right?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. No, I think that's fair. And we've
been very cautious. We've been very active, by the way, in the M&A area.
But we're going to -- the one thing we're known for, we're known for during
Dave's era and it's going to be the same during this one, is we're going to
stay disciplined in terms of M&A. But if you're selective and you're
active, which we're going to be both of these things, sometimes you can find
the gems at the right price. So we're going to continue to try and going to
have -- we have a robust pipeline, and we're not marching off the field because
things look expensive. They do. But we believe that there are opportunities out
there where we can participate at an appealing valuation.

Now having said that, if there's nothing that happens, well,
obviously, we're also going to be looking at buybacks and -- as another way to
distribute cash back to our shareowners. So there's always a balance. We'd like
to have some -- have ability to stay balanced. Our preference is for bolt-on
M&A, but it's got to be smart, and we got to pay the right price. And if we
can't get that done, then we're obviously going to be leaning a bit heavier on
buybacks.

OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with
Morgan Stanley.

NIGEL EDWARD COE, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION:
I'll keep this one simple, I think. So SPS -- the $0.05 to $0.07 SPS organic
growth obviously in 4Q, we've kind of been shadowboxing around this as well. So
math is not my strong point, but Intelligrated would be, what, 2, 2.5 points of
tailwind for that number, so we're looking at maybe a core of 4% to 5% ex
Intelligrated?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. I think -- I'd have to do the math,
but each of the businesses at least low to mid-single digit, I mean, putting
productivity products aside. So for example, the safety business, Nigel, I
mean, where it was low single digits in the third quarter, that's going to be
good mid-single digits in the fourth. Industrial safety will be well into the
mid- to higher single digits. High-risk business is doing well. We also will
have really strong results expected on the retail businesses. As you know,
we've changed the business model. That's going to be well into the double
digits.

Productivity, even with productivity products, overall,
we'll be high single digits in productivity. As Darius said, the scanning
business is doing fantastic. Workflow is going to be north of 20%. Our software
and sensing business will be mid- to high-single digits. Yes, Intelligrated
will be up, like we said it would be, but it's everywhere and globally as well.
I mean, it's in the U.S., it's Europe, China. So it's not just the pull from
Intelligrated that's doing this, nor is it the productivity products pulling us
down. These are all really good growers to give us that organic growth range we
talked about.

NIGEL EDWARD COE: No, that sounds pretty broad. One of your
competitors, Dematic, dropped a surprise warning in their warehouse business, I
think it was yesterday or day before. Seems to imply they're losing some share.
I mean, maybe you could just touch on how you're seeing the -- maybe the front
log in the warehouse business as you go into '18?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: We continue to be very bullish, and we had
a very strong orders quarter in Q3. We anticipate another one for Q4. And I
said, I believe this is really well positioned because it's -- what's really
growing the fastest is the e-commerce, high throughput, type of warehouses. And
that's exactly the sweet spot of that business. And customers are seeing their
value, and we're generating the orders. And as you can imagine, it's a very
quickly growing playing field in warehouse automation given the expansion in
warehouse and distribution. And we don't see that pausing. We're bullish on our
Q4, and we're bullish on 2018.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: We did take note of the competitor
announcement you talked about, and our -- but our -- as Darius said, our fourth
quarter -- our third quarter was just fantastic in terms of orders growth in
Intelligrated. I mean, strong, strong double digits, and as he said, we expect
that to continue. Backlog is really good, I mean, compared to last year, and
it's all organic growth, I mean, well over 50% backlog growth. So it's
positioned very well.

NIGEL EDWARD COE: And then just a quick one, Tom, on
(inaudible) bps of margin expansion in 4Q. Obviously, the FX hedge we got in
place for this year is margin dilutive, given the dynamics of stronger revenues
from weaker dollar but no impact to EBIT. So I'm just wondering would that be
about 20 bps or so? That's what my math tells me.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: You mean for Q4?

NIGEL EDWARD COE: For Q4, yes.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. I mean, the translation and --
that'll be about flat for us. I mean, year-over-year, I don't think that's
going to be a big impact overall, FX for the fourth quarter. When you consider
the hedges, the movement in the rates and everything, it's basically flat.

OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague
with Vertical Research.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, VERTICAL
RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: Just a quick one for me. You guys covered a lot of
ground. I just want to get a -- hone in a little bit further on this free cash
flow question looking forward. And I'm just wondering, perhaps this is for Tom,
but Darius is certainly welcome to chime in. Just -- what are the big bridge
items next year when we think about free cash flow? I'm assuming CapEx might be
down a little bit. I don't know if you expect help on working capital. You've
got growth would mitigate against it, right? So maybe your turns improve, but
maybe absolute working capital doesn't, pension, et cetera. Just like what are
the really big items next year that kind of puts you on the path to the 100% in
2019?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: I mean, when you look at 2017, Jeff, I
mean, we're looking at about $1 billion of CapEx, although that could be a
little heavy. When you look at that as an reinvestment ratio, expect that to
come down in 2020. They'll will be at least $150 million to $200 million less
of CapEx, which is a big driver for us. We do have incremental cash tax
spending this year, and it's mostly timing related. We'll have, probably by the
end of the year, incremental $500 million year-over-year. I don't expect that
to repeat next year. So that should give us some tailwind. And then most
importantly, operationally, as Darius talked about, is working capital. We're
kind of improving our trends, which means kind of treading water this year, not
necessarily adding huge amounts to working capital. The turns kind of staying
flat. But as you said, a lot of business focused on driving that going forward.
We're going to need $200 million, $300 million out of working capital next year
to drive towards that 100%. Those are the -- I'd say those are the big 3 things
that we're looking at.

OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Andrew Obin with
Bank of America.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN, MD, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Just a couple of questions. On Aerospace, as we think about the
defense portfolio of programs, as defense budgets improve, how should we think
about your portfolio of programs relative to budget, i.e. do you think you can
keep up with the budget? Meaning, is there something -- is there a big outline in
terms of your programs that Honeywell is going to be very different?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. No, I think it's going to be aligned.
I mean, we're seeing really good growth, particularly in the U.S. defense
budgets, where we have obviously greater clarity and a much greater density.
And that segment of the business is doing well, we anticipate to continue to do
well, and it will be aligned or higher than the growth. When it comes to
international, it's a little bit more hazy because obviously, we're talking a
lot of different countries, a lot of different programs. And we have some
programs that are ending, some that are continuing. But overall, the -- it's
kind of an up arrow given what we're seeing in the geopolitical arena,
anticipate slightly greater spending by NATO as a whole. So -- and some
recovery in the helo markets in the future, which is, as you know, is in that
segment. So overall, constructive when it comes to defense.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: Right. So that should be a nice tailwind
to Aerospace. Another question, just talking about China and emerging markets
visibility: a, what are you guys seeing on the ground with this party Congress?
Is everything on track? And the second, how should we think about your China
exposure going forward, given the portfolio changes that you guys have made now
that your China business is really driven by aero and UOP? Do you sort of
disconnect from the underlying China macro to a certain degree going forward?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: I mean, China and India, as we point out
this quarter, have been up 30%. And that success is not isolated to PMT or
aero. That's for every one of our business segments. And as you can imagine, as
COMAC gets going even further, aero actually -- that revenue potentially is
still way ahead of us, not behind us. Secondly, UOP, HPS are continuing to win
across the board in China and India, tremendous successes there this year.
Buildings and Home, we approach those markets a little bit differently than we
do in some of the developed markets. But again, double-digit growth in both, so
very well aligned with the urbanization trends. So whether that's the
independent homes business or the remaining buildings portfolio, are going to
do very, very well. Warehouse automation now moving on to SPS. Again, early days,
but it's a maturing segment and one in which we're going to participate in. And
then finally, industrial safety, another segment that's evolving and still in
kind of the early days. But clearly, worker safety is very much on the
forefront of the agenda of both China and India. And the regulatory environment
there is changing, much more worker-oriented. So across our portfolio, we're
excited about our potential in both China and India. Both of those are great
markets. We have great management team. They have both a local perspective. And
the results speak for themselves. I mean, 30% growth in Q3, I think, is
tremendous.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Add to that, Andrew, just to -- I think
your inference was that we're dependent upon HBT for growth there. But if you
look at the third quarter, I mean, HBT was our slowest grower amongst the --
all of the segments in China. So really...

OPERATOR: And we'll take our last question from Andrew
Kaplowitz with Citi.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ, MD AND U.S. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR HEAD,
CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Tom, last quarter, you stepped up
restructuring and talked about $150 million of benefits. And it does seem like
you will do a fair amount of restructuring here in the short term. I know you
talked about the $150 million of benefits from that last restructuring. But
will you have greater than normal restructuring tailwind as you enter 2018?
Like how do we look at that?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, I mean, I don't think it's
necessarily greater than what we would have had going into this year. In fact,
if you remember, Andy, that we did the significant restructuring when we
divided ACS up into HBT and SPS. There was a fair amount of delayering that
took place. It gave us some pretty good tailwinds as we headed into 2017. So in
2018, I agree, we've put a lot of capital to work on restructuring, and there
is clear momentum coming. But I wouldn't say it's a multiple of what we -- of
the tailwind that we had coming into '17. And we'll give you more color on that
as we get into our earnings outlook in December.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ: Okay. That's helpful. And Darius,
aero's been a pretty big positive surprise, I think, for you really the whole
year so far. How much do you think the surprise has been the early year
reorganization versus just you had a confluence of events last year that were
kind of negative that has gotten better here in 2017? And maybe what's been the
biggest surprise in the performance here in '17?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Well, yes. I mean, you're right. I'm very
-- Andrew, I'm very pleased with how aero is performing. I think, not that I'm
surprised by it, but I'm very pleased with what's happened in terms of
commercial excellence, the business capturing the aftermarket business, the
RMUs, the growth in Connected Aircraft. It's invested in that last year in Q4
in around 200 salespeople that's generating a lot of new sales. And we watch
that in a very detailed level. It's -- the business continues to drive
productivity, so it's -- it does what I always want every business to do, which
is grow the top line as well as get more productive every year. So -- I mean,
yes, that's certainly -- last year was a tough year. More headwinds on
concessions, but the reorganization also helped, as we segregated the
decision-making. It's now faster business, moves faster. So I'm really pleased
with how they're executing and its continued outlook for the future.

OPERATOR: And that concludes today's question-and-answer
session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius
Adamczyk for additional closing remarks.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Thank you. I'm pleased with our continued
performance in the third quarter, especially with our continued organic sales
acceleration, our improved profit conversion and our year-over-year improvement
of free cash flow. We remain focused on delivering the sustained financial
results you have come to expect from Honeywell. There will be no distractions,
even as we work to spin the Homes and Transportation Systems businesses. I look
forward to sharing more Honeywell successes with you and our plans for 2018
over the coming months. Enjoy rest of your fall. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. This does conclude today's
teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful
day.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
Honeywell's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would
now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice
President of Investor Relations.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.:
Thanks, Kathy. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's second quarter 2017
earnings conference call. With me here today are President and CEO, Darius
Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek.

As a reminder, this call and webcast, including any non-GAAP
reconciliations, are available on our website at 

. Note that elements of this
presentation contains forward-looking statements that are based on our best
view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements
can change and we'd ask that you interpret them in that light. We identified
the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our annual
report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.

This morning, we will review our financial results for the
second quarter, highlight some key wins across the businesses, and share our
guidance for the third quarter '17 and our updated guidance for the full year.
And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions at the end.

So with that, let me turn the call over to President and
CEO, Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK, PRESIDENT, CEO & DIRECTOR, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Today, we
reported another quarter of strong performance with each of our businesses
either meeting or exceeding the sales guidance we provided in April. Organic
sales growth exceeded the high end of our guidance range at over 3% with good
results in all 4 business segments. Our performance in the Aerospace
Aftermarket continued, and our U.S. defense business improved as we
anticipated. In Advanced Materials [within] Performance, Materials and
Technologies, we recorded another quarter of double-digit revenue growth,
driven by the continued adoption of our Solstice line of low global warming
products. And in the Home and Building Technologies, we exhibited strong
revenue growth at approximately 4% organic.

We also expanded margins by 50 basis points this quarter,
driven by commercial excellence and productivity, leading to earnings per share
that came in at the high end of our guidance range at $1.80 and up 10% from
2016 on a basis consistent with our guidance. Our second quarter tax rate was
lower than initially anticipated, and this enabled us to invest more than $115
million in restructuring and other projects. That's $90 million higher than we
contemplated in the guidance. These projects start delivering cost savings for
us later this year and ultimately will result in more than $115 million in run
rate savings.

Excluding this additional $90 million of restructuring
funding and 2016 earnings from last year's divestitures, on a normalized for
tax basis, earnings per share grew 10% year-over-year. I am pleased with our
continued performance, especially our organic sales growth momentum, which is a
testament to the growth investments we made in new technologies, platforms,
production capacity and M&A.

We are raising our full year sales guidance to a new range
of $39.3 billion to $40 billion, up 2% to 4% organic, and again, raising the
low end of our earnings guidance today. 2017 earnings per share is now expected
to be between $7 and $7.10. Tom will take you through the details shortly.

Each of our businesses made significant progress on our key
initiatives this quarter, and I'd like to provide some brief highlights. Let's
turn to Slide 3. In Aerospace, our suite of connected aircraft offering
continued to gain traction. We announced that GoDirect connected maintenance,
which combines our connectivity, in-depth product knowledge and data analytics
to predict when mechanical parts need to be fixed or replaced, will be used on
the auxiliary power units of 60 of Cathay's Airbus A330 aircraft. The agreement
was a result of a successful trial, which saved Cathay Pacific several hundred
thousand dollars in operational and reactive maintenance costs per aircraft and
reduced APU-related delays by 51%.

In Home and Building Technologies, we launched the Lyric C1
Wi-Fi Security Camera, the latest in our growing line of do-it-yourself
offerings that can help make homes smarter and serve a faster growing segment
of the market. The C1 can be set up easily using the Lyric app on your mobile
device, and it offers intelligent sound and motion detection. Since its launch
last month, the C1 camera has already generated more than $1 million in sales
and more than 80% of reviewers are recommending it. We have an exciting
pipeline of other new products in Home and Building Technologies that we'll
roll out over the latter half of the year.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, we announced the
agreement to acquire Nextnine, our leading provider of cyber security solutions
for industrial sites. Nextnine has an impressive installed base of more than
6,000 sites around the world. It is especially strong in the oil and gas,
utility, chemical and mining and manufacturing sectors. We are excited about
the combination of Nextnine, with our growing cyber security business within
Honeywell Process Solutions. Nextnine broadens our offerings for our install
base, while complementing our broader offerings in connected plants.

Lastly, in Safety and Productivity Solutions, we introduced
Connected Freight, which was developed with Intel and third-party logistic
companies. Connected Freight can help shippers and logistics companies monitor
high-value and perishable goods to prevent damage and loss. Sensor tags are
affixed to palettes or packages, and they send real time information about the
location and condition of critical freight while in transit. Our connected
offerings continue to gain traction and feedback from our customers has been
extremely positive. Our evolution as a software industrial leader is well
underway, and I'm encouraged by our progress.

With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to discuss our financial
results in more detail.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK, SENIOR VP & CFO, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thanks, Darius. Good morning, I'm on Slide 4. As Darius
mentioned, we achieved more than 3% organic sales growth in the second quarter.
The guidance was 0 to 2%. The momentum continued from the first quarter with
all of our businesses either meeting or exceeding their sales guidance. Segment
profit was $1.9 billion. That was up 6%, excluding the impact from our 2016
divestitures. Segment margin expanded 50 basis points from 2016. That was
driven by volume leverage and commercial excellence, as well as our continued
focus on productivity and returns from previously executed restructuring
projects.

Earnings per share were $1.80. Our second quarter tax rate
was 21.3%, lower than [the] originally expected due to higher than anticipated
employee stock option exercises, but this favorable impact was offset by
provisions for additional restructuring projects beyond what we anticipated in
the original guidance. These investments will drive further growth and
productivity mostly starting in 2018. Excluding those investments and earnings
from our 2016 divestitures and normalized for tax at 25% in both periods,
earnings per share was up 10% year-over-year.

Our free cash flow momentum continues with strong
operational performance in each of our segments. Year-to-date, free cash flow
was up 39% from 2016 despite approximately $300 million more in timing-related
income tax payments. Overall, it was another quarter of strong operational
performance.

Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our segments in more
detail. Let me start with Aerospace, which delivered a very strong quarter in
both sales and profit. Aerospace sales growth was 2 percentage points above the
high end of our guidance. Strength in the Commercial Aftermarket continued this
quarter with strong repair and overhaul activity, growing sales of retrofits,
modifications and upgrades and robust spares demand in the air transport and
regional segment. The business and general aviation aftermarket was also up,
primarily driven by timing of customer demand. Overall, aftermarket sales grew
5% this quarter.

The OE dynamics we've talked about in the last quarter
continued with market-related weakness in business and general aviation and
slowing shipments for the legacy air transport platforms, partially offset by
growth in new platforms. Overall, OE sales were down 5%.

Defense sales were up 5% -- or I'm sorry, defense sales were
up 2% driven by deliveries related to the F-35 program and sensors and guidance
systems within the U.S. defense segment. This was partially offset by continued
weakness in the space and commercial helicopter markets as we anticipated.

In Transportation Systems, growth was driven by continued
recovery of the commercial vehicles market, with demand especially strong for
on-highway turbos in the U.S., Europe and China. The China growth was driven by
new regulations that restrict the weight of commercial vehicles, spurring
demand for turbocharger technology that can provide more power to smaller-sized
engines. This is a trend we expect to continue for the remainder of 2017.

Aerospace segment margin expansion of 140 basis points for
the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by that higher sales
volume, as well as productivity, net of inflation, and the favorable impact of
the 2016 divestiture of the government services business.

Home and Building Technologies performance was mixed, with
strong organic sales, but lower than anticipated margin rate growth. HBT
organic sales grew 4% at the high end of the guidance range, driven by both
products and distribution. Within products, we executed several large smart
meter program rollouts. We saw continued strong demand for clean air and water
products in China, and we delivered nice growth within our homes business in
North America. The sales growth acceleration in the products segment was also
encouraging. Distribution continued to perform well, with strength in both
Honeywell Building Solutions and global distribution. Orders were up 5% in
Building Solutions and backlog was up double digits, so we expect growth in
this business to continue.

Segment margin for HBT was below our expectations, coming in
flat for the quarter. We continue to see benefits from previously funded
restructuring and our ongoing productivity initiatives, but those savings were
offset by an unfavorable sales mix in the quarter. We had higher sales of
lower-margin products in smart energy and Environmental & Energy Solutions,
and lower volumes in security and fire.

In Smart Energy, we're conducting aggressive value -- or
cost/value engineering efforts, aimed at reducing manufacturing costs, but our
results from those projects have not materialized as quickly as we anticipated.
We also saw margin pressure from a regional perspective, as we had plus 20%
growth in China and over 40% in some of the HBT businesses in China, but we saw
weaker sales growth in other more profitable regions. Clearly not the complete
result we desire in HBT, but we're encouraged by the sales momentum and we're
taking actions to address the profit performance, including better material
productivity and stronger commercial execution.

Performance Materials and Technologies had another very
strong quarter with organic sales up 6%. The guide was 3% to 5% and 200 basis
points of margin expansion. The guide was 170 to 200 basis points. There is
encouraging news throughout the PMT business. Overall, UOP sales were up single
digits -- mid-single digits, orders were up 40% and the backlog is up double
digits. There was continued strength in UOP Russell, specifically in the
modular gas processing application with 6 new units booked this quarter. We've
booked 12 Russell units so far this year, more than double the amount booked in
the first half of 2016. The orders in other segments of UOP continue -- support
a continued ramp-up in organic sales volumes in the third quarter.

In HPS, sales were down slightly, but margins expanded
significantly due to commercial excellence and productivity. We saw lower
backlog conversion in the projects business and lower demand for process,
measurement and control products in Europe. This was partially offset by
significant growth in the short cycle software and service businesses. HPS
orders were up about 15% and the backlog is growing nicely.

Advanced Materials had another quarter of double-digit
growth and margin expansion, enabled by CapEx investments we made for our
Solstice line of low global warming products. In May, we started up our largest
Solstice facility and the world's largest automotive refrigerant plant in
Louisiana, which is meeting continued demand for our Solstice yf product. Sales
in our Solstice business nearly doubled in the quarter.

Margin expansion came in at the high end of our guidance
range, driven by productivity, net of inflation, results from our commercial
excellence efforts and the divestiture of the former Resins & Chemicals
business in the third quarter of 2016. We'll lap this impact in the fourth
quarter. And as I mentioned, margin performance was particularly strong in HPS
and the Advanced Materials business.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, organic sales were up
1%. Safety grew 2% on an organic basis, driven by our high risk personal
protection equipment and gas detection offerings. The general safety business
has been improving sequentially for the past several quarters and also returned
to positive organic growth in the second quarter, thanks to sales and marketing
initiatives, as well as investments in our sales force. Workflow solutions also
grew high single digit in the quarter, driven by high demand for our leading
voice-enabled solutions and double-digit growth in the mobilizer software
business, driven by a large win in Europe.

In sensing and IoT, demand for sensing controls remained
robust, particularly in high-growth regions. Intelligrated continues to deliver
impressive results, growing more than 30% this quarter compared to the second
quarter of 2016 when it was not yet owned by Honeywell. Now this was driven by
large project awards with key accounts. We continue to see strong orders and
backlog growth in Intelligrated, which, as a reminder, will begin to be counted
in Honeywell's organic sales growth rates at the beginning of September.

Productivity products was down in the quarter, driven by
decreased North America sales, particularly for the mobility business. Although
we anticipate that productivity products will improve in Q3 and Q4, our more
aggressive product launches will occur in the fourth quarter, and we'll likely
continue to see softness in the mobility business until early 2018.

SPS segment margins, while below our expectations, were
still strong, expanding 90 basis points, excluding the first year dilutive
impact from M&A. This was primarily driven by continued productivity and
restructuring benefits and was partially offset by investments in our
commercial excellence as well as lower volumes in the mobility business. The
shortfall to our expectations was primarily driven by lower-than-expected
volumes in productivity products, accelerated investments related to the
go-to-market strategy shift for the retail business, as well as the new product
launch investments I mentioned.

Slide 6 is a walk of our earnings per share from second
quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2017. In the second quarter of last
year, earnings from our 2016 divestitures were approximately $0.05 per share,
and we exclude those amounts from our 2016 baseline, consistent with our
guidance framework. For comparison purposes, we have also normalized the tax
rate for the second quarter 2016 to the 25% effective tax rate we initially
assumed in our '17 guidance, the impact of which was minor. Segment profit
improvement resulted in an $0.11 increase in earnings per share and all of our
segments are contributing to the growth. Other below-the-line items,
principally lower interest expense as a result of the debt refinancings we did
in 2016, as well as higher pension income, accounted for a $0.05 improvement to
earnings per share, bringing it to the $1.80, right at the high end of our
guidance and up 10% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, our second quarter
tax rate was lower than anticipated at 21.3%, principally the result of higher
than anticipated stock option exercises, which resulted in a $0.09 earnings per
share benefit. Conversely, the additional restructuring provisions that Darius
and I mentioned reduced earnings per share by a similar $0.09. On average, the
payback of these projects is under 2 years, and overall, they'll generate more
than $150 million in run rate cost savings. The pipeline of funded but
unexecuted restructuring products -- projects is robust at more than $300
million, and will continue to drive returns as the projects are executed.

Let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our expectations for the
quarter -- for the third quarter. In Aerospace, reported sales are expected to
be down 2% to 4%, primarily due to the impact of the 2016 divestiture of the
government service business, and organic sales are expected to be flat to up
2%. Within Commercial OE, we expect strong air transport deliveries for new
platforms, partially offset by the impact of declining shipments on legacy
platforms. We anticipate a tailwind from customer incentives, which will
improve our sales and segment margin in the third quarter. And as we have
mentioned, we do not expect a recovery in the business jet OE market until
closer to the late 2018 or 2019 time frame, but we do anticipate modest growth
in the business aviation aftermarket on continued R&O activity. We also
expect continued strength in the air transport aftermarket, driven by
retrofits, modifications and upgrades, as well as by the typical seasonal
demand.

The commercial vehicle market should continue to recover,
driving modest growth in transportation systems. Growth in light vehicle gas
continued to be driven by demand in high-growth regions. Aerospace margin
should expand significantly this quarter, driven by the OEM incentive tailwind,
improving volumes and the continued benefit from prior year restructuring
projects. In HBT, we anticipate organic sales of 1% to 3%, and reported sales
growth to be slightly lower, so flat to up 2%, due to the impacts of foreign
currency translation. In the second quarter, there was gradual month over month
sales growth improvement, with good momentum exiting the quarter. We expect
those strong trends to continue.

Within the products business, we'll have additional large
smart meter program rollouts, principally in Europe, and anticipate continued
demand for air and water products in China. In distribution, the strong orders
and backlog trends in Building Solutions, combined with the commercial
excellence initiatives and growing scale of our global distribution business,
will continue to contribute to growth. HBT segment margins are expected to
expand 10 to 40 basis points, driven by cost reductions from prior
restructuring actions, ongoing commercial excellence and productivity
initiatives. These will be partially offset by the continuation of the
headwinds from the unfavorable product mix I mentioned earlier.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, sales are
expected to be down 6% to 8% on a reported basis, primarily due to the impact
of the 2016 spinoff of the Resins & Chemicals business. But on an organic
basis, we expect PMT to grow at 7% to 9%, driven by conversion to sales of our
strong backlog.

UOP is expected to deliver more than 20% growth, driven by
strong licensing sales, continued strength in the modular gas processing
business and demand for hydro processing catalysts. We expect strong growth
across the entire HPS portfolio, but primarily in our life cycle solutions and
services, field products and combustion businesses.

In Advanced Materials, we expect mid-single-digit growth
fueled principally by Solstice. PMT segment margins are expected to expand 130
to 170 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, productivity and the
favorable impact of the Resins & Chemicals divestiture.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales are expected to
be up 2% to 4% on an organic basis with reported sales increasing about 20% due
to the impact of sales from the Intelligrated acquisition. The fourth quarter
is the first full quarter of Intelligrated organic sales.

In the safety business, we expect further recovery in
general safety products and a gradual improvement in the retail channel as our
go-to-market transition from a distribution model to a direct sales model is
executed. Growth in productivity will be driven by a robust order pipeline in
the workflow solutions, and continued strong demand for sensing controls. SPS
margins are expected to expand by more than 150 basis points, excluding the
first year dilutive impacts of M&A. This is driven primarily by benefit
from last year's restructuring projects, the higher volumes, as well as the
results from our ongoing productivity efforts. So for the company in total,
organic sales growth is anticipated to be 2% to 4%, with 120 to 160 basis
points of margin expansion, leading to earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.75.
That's up 13% to 16% year-over-year. And again, that excludes divestitures and
it's normalized to the third year -- sorry, third quarter tax rate of 26%. To
the extent our tax rate is lower than 26%, like we did in the second quarter, we
intend to undertake additional restructuring projects.

Let's move to Slide 8. As we previously mentioned, we're
raising the low end of our full year EPS guidance by $0.10 to the new range of
$7 to $7.10. That's up 8% to 10%, and again, that excludes the divestitures and
last year's debt refinancing charges. We're also raising our full year sales
guidance to $39.3 billion to $40 billion. Sales are now expected to be up 2% to
4% organic, driven by higher volumes.

In terms of our segments, PMT organic sales growth guidance
is now 5% to 7% for the full year. SPS reported sales growth guidance is now
18% to 20%, and the low end of Aerospaces's sales outlook is up slightly since
the last quarter. From a segment margin expansion perspective, we remain within
the initial guidance range of 70 to 110 basis points. We have lowered the full
year margin guidance for both HBT and SPS, and increased the margin guide for
Aero. In SPS, we still expect strong operational margin performance, consistent
with our previous guidance.

Overall, there'll be puts and takes across the businesses,
but we're confident in our ability to deliver our full year margin expansion
guidance, and we remain focused on executing for the remainder of 2017. There's
no change to our full year free cash flow guidance. The first year -- or sorry,
first half free cash flow performance was good, showing a 39% performance
year-over-year, and we're focused on continuous improvements in our execution
across the organization.

Let me turn to Slide 9 for a quick wrap up. We had a strong
second quarter, with higher than anticipated organic growth, continued margin
expansion and good performance in all segments. The trends we've seen in the
first half of the year are expected to continue, leading to third quarter earnings
per share that are expected to be up healthy double digits. The entire
organization is focused on executing Darius' key priorities, which, as you'll
recall, include improving organic sales growth, maintaining our productivity
rigor, becoming a best-in-class software industrial company and continuing to
aggressively deploy capital, all the while continuing to make significant
investments in Honeywell's future.

With that, let's move, Mark, to Q&A.

MARK MACALUSO: Thanks, Tom. Both Darius and Tom are available
to answer your questions. Kathy, if you could, please open the line for
Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And we will go first to
Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: So just a question on the ACS-related businesses, in HBT, obviously,
the margins have been a little bit weak there and even in the SPS business.
Darius, can you talk maybe about the volume of kind of investments you guys are
putting to work there? I mean, any kind of color on -- is this -- I know
investment is usually not discretionary, per se, given competitive pressures
out there. But maybe some degree of magnitude around what you're -- what kind
of money you're putting to work there? I think that's the first question. I
have a quick follow-up.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think, clearly, we're
investing both in RD&E, and really reallocating our sales force as well
because, frankly, we've had some places where fundamentally we under invest.
And I think as a matter of fact, I would say in our developed markets, we've
under invested in terms of sales force and HGR, although, we've had very
aggressive investments. We also want to make sure that those investments are
paying off, and they are because, by the way, as I look at what happened in HBT
in Q2, part of the issue here is a mix change. Just to give you a couple of
facts, our China EE&S (sic) [E&ES] business was up 45% in Q2, and
that's a little bit part of the margin mix challenge that we had here in the
quarter. But overall, I continue to be very bullish. The other thing is that
we're working on is what I call kind of a second tier of value offerings for
[E&S] and HSF, as well as investing in our DIY platforms. That's how I'd
characterize most of the investments.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Is there a degree of kind of margin
pressure that's happening today that can kind of spin back into the numbers as
growth comes through? Is it kind of like a step up or just any way to somewhat
quantify that or not really?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: I mean, I think, obviously, the competitive
-- yes, I would say not (inaudible). I think that some of it is a mix, and
absolutely, some of it is we've got to do a little bit better on a couple of
elements. The 2 places I'd point to is, I think, we have an opportunity to
drive better material productivity. I have higher expectations there. And the
second one is around pricing and commercial excellence because I think,
frankly, some of those areas has -- we haven't done as well as we could have.
Having said that, I think, overall, it's a pretty positive story because, as
you look at our markets, we grew faster than our markets, particularly on the
residential side. So all in all, yes, I'm slightly disappointed by the margin
rate, but we have some actions that Terrence and his team are working, and I
don't want also to forget about a 4% top line growth with tremendous growth in
China, just well north of 20% for HBT.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: And that could be an '18 story, that
improvement, an '18 story?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, yes. (inaudible)

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. And then one last quick one on
-- one last one on free cash flow. Normal seasonality kind of gets you north of
where you're guiding to. Is there anything that kind of reverses in the second
half that suggests that it shouldn't kind of track a more normal seasonal trend
for the second half, Tom?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: No, I think we're fine on cash. I mean,
we've kind of -- when you look -- when you draw the mark at the end of the
first half, overall conversion is right in line with where we were last year,
but in the second half, some of the initiatives that we've got going are going
to drive that stronger performance. Frankly, I think we should do better than
overall 5% to 7%, to your point, on the first half growth. But we've got a
little bit of a track record of not necessarily being entirely accurate on our
cash forecasts, and so we want to be sufficiently conservative as we head into
the second half, but big effort for us.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, Steve, I'd just point out that we have
had some headwinds, both in the first half on cash taxes, well north of $300
million, and then we have some more coming in the second half. So that's why I
think -- but by the way, that's already reflected in our outlook for the year.
And that's why it may seem like we're being a little conservative, but we've
got some real headwinds.

OPERATOR: We'll now go to Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.

NIGEL EDWARD COE, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: I
just wanted to dig back into HBT. And I think the moving parts there were
pretty well known. But obviously, foreign security is a bit weaker versus the
segment average. So I'm wondering, do we have visibility on some improvement in
that in the second half of the year? Is that more of an '18 story? And then the
second part of that question is, I think, this is the first time you've called
out China as a below fleet average margin geography. Maybe I'm wrong there, but
what is the path towards getting China margins back to fleet -- or towards
fleet average or better?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, I wouldn't -- I think as any kind of
high-growth HGR geography, it's slightly dilutive to the overall average. And
obviously, when you blend it in at a 45% growth, it has an impact. And in terms
of margins, we've worked those pretty aggressively. Terrence is all over this,
both on the productivity side, as well as the commercial excellence side. We
have some opportunity. We have some new products coming. So I expect some level
of recovery and we are going to grow margins in that business this year. We
probably were a little bit aggressive initially, and that's why we made some --
we had some puts and takes in the overall Honeywell portfolio. That happened to
be one of the takes. But we expect growth there, the margin growth for 2017 and
further enhancements for 2018. And I can also tell you that a good portion of
the restructuring funds that we allocated in Q2 went to HBT.

NIGEL EDWARD COE: Okay, that's helpful. And then a question
for Tom on the hedging, and given the weakness in the dollar we've seen
continuing through 3Q. So the way I understand it, it's helpful -- it's helpful
to top line. It's harmful to EBIT. So there's a bit of a margin pressure. So
just looking at your unchanged segment guidance for the year, I'm wondering if
the better volumes on margin has been offset by a little bit of pressure from
FX or maybe it's immaterial? But maybe you can just clean that up. And then
where do you stand on hedging for '18?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, so just for 2017, Nigel, we'll be --
we're more or less about 3/4 or more locked in on FX rates. And as you know, we
-- our hedging program is intended, when you consider all the aspects of it,
the net result is to hedge the operating income and not necessarily the top
line -- definitely not the top line. So our top line will definitely float as
the FX floats. And so if you see the euro strengthening as you have over the
last few weeks, our top line should improve. However, our margin rates, our
margin dollars are more or less locked in for most of the major currencies for
the year, given the hedging that we did at the beginning of the year. So if you
start to see a strengthening second half in -- a strengthening or weakening
second half, that's not going to have a material impact on our margin rates
themselves, given that we've kind of locked the rates in. So 2018, we're taking
a similar approach. We don't necessarily disclose all the positions, but we're
keeping a strong eye on the currencies, where we have major exposures, euro
being a big one, and taking risk off the table as we see the opportunities
arise.

OPERATOR: We will now take a question from Jeffrey Sprague
of Vertical Research Partners.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, VERTICAL
RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: Couple of questions. First on Intelligrated and the
growth that you're seeing there. Would this all still be associated with what
they had in the pipeline and the order book at the time of the deal? Or is
there some kind of Honeywell benefit that's starting to show up in the results?
That's the first question.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: No. I would -- the answer to your question
is no, this was not there at the time of the deal. There's a lot -- the
pipeline has grown substantially. And certainly, there is an inherent Honeywell
benefit. I mean, frankly, the Honeywell brand is really well known throughout
the industrial and for the [patient] and logistics world. And it's -- we've
benefited from the current relationships that we've had. And as you recall, the
premise behind this business going into an SPS is our scanning and mobility
business, its strongest vertical is transportation logistics, so there's a lot
of benefit in terms of cross-selling and leveraging that sales force to
generate leads for Intelligrated. So we're certainly seeing the benefits from
that. And that pipeline, Intelligrated, is extraordinarily robust.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: And then just on thinking about PMT
margins and a lot going on there with UOP and HPS. But just thinking about how
Solstice ramps, can you give us some sense of how fully utilized the new
factory or factories are? And kind of what kind of operating leverage we could
expect flowing as you ramp-up Solstice here?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, so I mean, the new factory, the Apollo
factory that Tom referred to, it's not fully utilized yet. That just came
online, it started up in May. So think about a 50% like utilization, which is
kind of normal at this stage because it's still ramping up to its (inaudible).
There's more leverage there to come. And we're going to be kind of shifting our
supply a bit from sort of externally sourced and so on to more internally
produced. Obviously, that's going to be accretive, which is good news. So the
short story here is that there is more leverage to come. And as you saw, Jeff,
a really, really nice story in PMT. I mean, it's -- both in terms of orders,
leverage on the revenue and Solstice continues to deliver.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: And strong backlogs, too. I mean, we have
a nice backlog as we head into the second half of the year in all the
businesses.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: And then just one other quick one. Tom
can you just put a finer point on what the variances Q3 versus Q3 in the aero
incentives? Either in dollars or margin and (inaudible)

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, it's about a, I'd say, 50 basis
points margin impact year-over-year. And it's -- as you know, the 2000 overall
incentives for the year are going to be probably 40 to 60 basis points down,
most of that coming in the second half and most of that being in the third
quarter. So this is where you see the biggest impact, and that's why those
Aerospace margin rates for the third quarter will be so robust. I mean, they're
already robust without the incentives. I mean the -- but up to 300-plus of
improvement is pretty strong. I think the other thing I could point to is...

(technical difficulty)

OPERATOR: And now we'll go to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE, VP AND LEAD MULTI-INDUSTRY ANALYST,
GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So -- Tom, maybe just following up
on -- maybe following up on that point right there on the OEM incentives. It's
interesting when you take a look at your organic growth guidance for 3Q in
Aero, I was surprised that it wasn't a little bit higher because you do have
the benefit from OEM and you have a pretty easy comp. So is there any -- what's
kind of offsetting that in 3Q? Or is this just kind of like a conservative 3Q
guide?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, I think we want to build up some momentum.
We had a strong Commercial aftermarket, 5% in the second quarter and we kind of
want to see that momentum continue. I mean, that we sort of factored in at low
single digits for the third quarter. I think Defense & Space, we've got a
comparable quarter-over-quarter. The incentives do come through. And if they do
-- I mean, they will come through. If the aftermarket comes through like it did
in the second quarter, we should be definitely at the high end of that 2%
organic. It's not pushing higher.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Joe, I would like just to add, I think the
mix is such that we kind of know -- we know the visibility on OEE. We know
roughly what that looks like. And so we were actually getting much more into
the shorter cycle business for aftermarket, especially on the BGA side. So
frankly, we don't really -- we don't have as much visibility as we normally
would in Aerospace because that's what we are counting on. And thus we -- as
Tom pointed out, we want to kind of see that rate of aftermarket activity both
on the ATR and BGA side maintain. And that's why we let the guidance be where
it is.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE: Got it, okay. And then maybe just
following up on Steve's question from just a little earlier, but asking it
slightly differently. I guess, if you think about all the restructuring actions
that you guys have taken, the pull forward in 3Q of last year, additional
restructuring this year in 2Q, it's nice to see that the growth uptick. But I
guess, maybe if you could just kind of comment on the -- just what you're
seeing competitively and your ability to hold the cost benefits into your
margin? And how much you're actually having to utilize to actually offset
potentially a competitive pricing environment? I think any color around that
would be helpful.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Sure. Yes, I mean, there's a couple of
points. The first one is we definitely are seeing the benefits of restructuring
come through and that's certainly there. I think your question is probably more
around HBT. And yes, it is a competitive environment. However, we also have a
very strong competitive position and we're seeing that in our growth rates
particularly in high-growth regions but also in DM. So part of it is mix but
part of it is we get a -- we've got an opportunity to be a little bit better,
like I said, on the mature productivity side, commercial excellence and so on,
as well as some of the new product launches that we're doing and kind of
offering -- having the Honeywell premium tier as well as the value tier as well
as expansion of the DIY. So there are some self-help things that we're
embarking upon and really started in Q2 and I expect to see some benefit of
that towards the end of this year and even more so next year. So yes, it's a
competitive environment. But given our brand, product positioning, overall
value to customers, I'm bullish on how we're going to perform here.

OPERATOR: And now we will go to Peter Arment of Baird.

PETER J. ARMENT, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD
& CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Tom, you mentioned -- briefly, on
PMT on the backlog, you -- ex kind of Solstice. How is backlog holding up or
what kind of visibility do you have? Can you give us a little more color there?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. It's -- I mean it's really strong.
It -- you -- when you look at the -- both HPS as well as UOP, I mean, they're
both north of 10% -- I'm sorry, in total, they're north of 10%. UOP is pushing
20%. HPS, as I said, strong momentum and we think that's going to continue. The
-- when you look at the character of what's in UOP, it's particularly
encouraging because you see it across all of their product lines, which means
that it's not just in after markets we're getting catalysts sales, but we're
getting the full gamut of things, the engineering, the new projects, the
equipment. And that means that there is even more investing going on than we
had seen over the course of last year. So good prospects and good back -- good
character, comprehensive character of backlog across the UOP businesses. In
HPS, same thing. I mean, even more skewed towards the higher profit service
side or HPS. I mean, that's pushing 10% up. And then the only reason the HPS
backlog isn't where the UOP one is, in terms of double digits, is that we've
been carrying and been very successful with some of these mega projects in HPS.
And as you execute those and they come out of the backlog, obviously, you see
the impact. Those projects carry a lot of third-party content, however. They
are not necessarily the most profitable. But they build installed base and we
find them, overall, to be very attractive long term. So when I look at HPS
backlog, even though it's mid-single digits growth, the character of it from a
profitability perspective is quite different than you would have thought a year
ago or you would have seen a year ago, so.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: If I could just add a little even more
color, because we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. If you think
about backlog for all of PMT, up double digit. Think about order rates for PMT
for Q2, up north of 20%. And the best part, Q3 outlook, high single digit
outlook for order rates. So we're really, really pleased how that business is
performing. And we -- this is going to get maintained and that kind of momentum
is out there for us.

PETER J. ARMENT: And just a quick unrelated follow-up on the
bizjet weakness. Tom, it just sounds like it's been a lingering issue for a
long time, but I mean does it sounds like that things have gotten worse on the
OE side. Any color there it would be appreciated.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: No, I mean, the -- when you look at -- go
back 18 months or a couple of years and you were seeing heavy double-digit
declines on the BGA OE. Remember in the fourth quarter, we were -- or second
half we were down over 30% on the OE side. It's -- those declines have
moderated. It was a mid-single-digit decline in the second quarter for the BGA
OE business and we kind of expect it to moderate around that. I mean, the
orders can be a little bit lumpy and the timing doesn't necessarily exactly
correlate to what our customers would report for their unit shipments, but I'd
-- I'm not going to say we've seen the bottom. But it's -- the rates of decline
are significantly, significantly less than what they were a year ago.

OPERATOR: We will now move to Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ, MD AND U.S. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR HEAD,
CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: There is -- you didn't make an acquisition in
Q2, but acquisition activity has still been relatively quiet. And you've talked
about valuations in the past being pretty high and maybe waiting for tax
reform. Do you expect to have a big ramp-up in M&A activity in the second
half of this year? And if not, do you end up buying back more stock? I mean,
how should we look at capital allocation in the second half of the year?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: I would say that the pipeline is very
active and we probably have 3 to 5 things we're looking at very, very
seriously. But we're going to continue to be cautious buyers. And I think part
of it is just this -- the discipline around purchase price. There are certainly
things out there that we're very interested in, but they also have to come at
the right price. So hopefully, I never guarantee what will happen but,
hopefully, we'll have some additions to the portfolio here in the second half.
We certainly have some interesting properties that were closely examining. But
it also has to happen at the rightful price, so we'll see what happens. And
we're not, I mean, I think the tax environment regime, I think there's more
uncertainty in that now than maybe even before, so I can't let that sort of
rule the business and we're not going to hold that up. I indicated before, we
have a slight preference for overseas M&A versus domestic, but certainly,
we'd look at anything. So we'll see what happens. Now in terms of share
buyback, as I indicated, depending on what happens on the M&A front. And
we're going to be looking at that as a lever as well. But I want to make sure
we really exhaust those possibilities first and I'm still hoping we'll have a
little more clarity on the tax front, maybe even before the end of this
quarter.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: And Andy just to add to that, put a
little bit of balance on that. You remember Darius said at the Investor Day
that from a capital allocation perspective, U.S. we would have -- look to
deploy $5 billion this year between dividends, share buybacks and M&A. The
dividend is more or less understood to be about $2 billion of that $5 billion.
That leaving $3 billion between share buyback and M&A. So far, we've done
about $1 billion of share buyback and -- so we've got a couple of billion left
and, as Darius says, we are going to watch that. That's the $5 billion in the
U.S. Outside the U.S., as he said at the time, there's close to $10 billion of
capacity that is ready to be put to use immediately, let alone -- or excluding
even the leveraging capabilities. So I think we're on track on both fronts, but
I -- same thing with Darius, I don't think there is an impending rush of deals
that you are going to see after we get off this call. So we'll keep you guys in
the loop.

ANDREW ALEC KAPLOWITZ: And then Darius, your commentary
around your productivity products business suggests that maybe your new product
rollouts there have been maybe slower than you thought or at least not quite as
effective. Can you talk about your confidence level on turning around that
business as you trim the portfolio here?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, and I think that -- the one thing
that's important to -- as you think about SPS, I think it's important to put in
context where the issue is. The issue is in one business and in one segment of
the business called Mobility, and it's even more regional than that, which is
called North America. And as I pointed out, the issue in the last call which is
sort of our array of products in the Android operating system. Frankly, we're
not where we need to be in terms of a range and offering. We did launch a good
product in Q2 which will help. I don't think it's the full solution. The team
has very robust launch plans, but frankly, those won't happen until about Q4 of
this year. So we'll -- we're expecting some improvement in the second half, but
really kind of a full improvement is -- will really happen in 2018 as all those
products come through the market. Although I will say we are encouraged by the
product launch that they did do in May, but we don't really have a lot of our
revenue yet generated from those offerings.

OPERATOR: And now we will go to Andrew Obin of Bank of
America Merrill Lynch.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN, MD, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Just a follow-up question on China. Is the mix in China changing?
Because historically, my understanding of the China was more profitable but you
have been talking about a big push in consumer area in China. Is that something
that is impacting margin?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: China is still very attractive and very
profitable. The product segments that happen to do, especially in HBT, this
quarter was -- were sort of a mix which is, as I mentioned, slightly dilutive
to the overall HBT rate. But overall, we're very, very pleased with the China
profitability and overall on a Honeywell basis it compares to our overall
margins. And when we're seeing the kind of growth we're seeing, that's a great
thing for us. And we're very bullish there. And I think, if I had to point to a
market that I was extraordinarily pleased with in Q2, that would be it. Our
China growth was spectacular.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. Just to accentuate that a little
bit, the GDP -- whatever the right GDP is for China, say it's 7%, I mean, every
one of our businesses was well north of that. Aerospace is just doing fantastic
on the R&O side. TS has got new launches, taking advantage of the air
quality opportunities there. HBT and a lot of new products, particularly around
air and water, up double digit. Safety and productivity up double digit and PMT
up double digit. I mean, UOP and HBS, Advanced Materials, all of them were just
outstanding in China. As we get more momentum there and we leverage the
capacity that we have from a production perspective that the profitability
continues to grow and it's already very healthy.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: And Shannon and his team have always had
a very and, I think, Honeywell have always had a very sophisticated view of
China. We're getting a lot of questions from investors about Chinese growth
after this big party Congress they're going to have in October, November. What
are you guys sort of framework for growth in the first half of 2018? Some people
tell us growth will slow down, some people tell us they will try to save face
and so the new team will see good growth as well. What are your insights?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Obviously, it's very important for the
Chinese economy to do pretty well until that November time frame, but overall,
we continue to be bullish on China. I think whether this pace is maintained or
something slightly lower than that, I don't think that changes our calculus as
it relates to China because we expect growth there to be 4 or 5x what it is in
some of our [DM] markets and we're showing those kinds of numbers. And then, by
the way, when Tom talked double digits, that's not 10%. Think the number that's
well 2x times that number. So we don't -- we've have the right momentum. We have
the right presence. We're very comfortable with our strategies in terms of what
we're doing east for east and east to west. And I still think it's really early
innings for us in terms of building out our China business and actually using
it more as a hub for a lot of the other HGR economies. So I continue to be
optimistic. Whether it's going to get better or slightly worse, in my view, it
doesn't change our investment profile and our bullishness overall on the
market.

OPERATOR: And now we'll take a question from Julian Mitchell
of Credit Suisse.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL, HEAD OF GLOBAL CAPITAL GOODS RESEARCH
TEAM, DIRECTOR, & LEAD ANALYST FOR US ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT, CRÃ©DIT SUISSE
AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just a first question really around the transport piece
within Aerospace. The growth there was around 1% or 2% in the first half. I
think, you're seeing commercial vehicles recovering a bit, but the automotive
side may be softening. So maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in
automotive, specifically, how you' think that plays out in the second half? And
how you're thinking more broadly about the growth outlook for transport?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, [Patrick] talked about automotives.
Again, automotives grew -- that business grew for us this past quarter. It's
kind of -- it was a bit of an interesting mix. Diesel was down and it was down
high single digit, but more than offset by growth in gasoline, growth in
commercial vehicles and high-growth regions really, really took off. I talked
about China again, but again, a great story. You talk about double-digit growth
in China. This -- we grew over 40% there in Q2. So a really nice growth rate,
and we're really well positioned globally. So even though some of our markets
in U.S. and Europe were down slightly, they were more than offset by our
presence and our growth in HGR. So really nice positioning of that business and
we continue to be very, very bullish on its outlook. Even a country like Brazil
grew well, double digit, so nice story for us.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. The other thing I would add to that,
Julian, is the -- some of this is just timing related as you -- as we complete
platforms or our customers, our OE customers discontinue platforms that we're
on. That can have a short-term impact on rates, and we've seen a couple
platforms that come to completion in the second quarter. But as you know our
win rates on new platforms for the business has been at an all-time high. I
mean, we think we're pushing 50% of the win rate on new platforms. So that will
start to come through as well. So I wouldn't read into the 1% as indication of
any challenge. I think overall, we're in pretty good shape, as Darius says, on
the transportation business.

JULIAN C.H. MITCHELL: Understood. And then my second
question would really be on SPS and sort of the platform outlook there within
warehouse automation and logistics, specifically. You had Intelligrated now
within the portfolio for 9 months or so. Do you think you're in a position now,
having integrated it well to date, to do further M&A in that warehouse
arena? Or are you pretty satisfied with the market share and the offering you
have right now?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: I mean that -- we certainly like this
space. If there is the right acquisition that we had I would certainly look at
it. It's an interesting market for us. We do have a strong presence between our
scanning and mobility business, between Intelligrated. Even our industrial
safety and a lot of the safety gears that we sell into that market all go
together and create a very coherent and valuable proposition for our customers.
But certainly, we'll look at some other segments if there's something of
interest there, so we'll see what happens.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: I think the warehouse automation space is
going to be a really nice one for us to continue to invest in. I mean, you have
-- we've got the building blocks but there are a lot of both adjacencies
geographically as well as software-wise that really we can enhance the model
with. So we're excited by what we see.

OPERATOR: We will now take a question from John Inch of
Deutsche Bank.

JOHN GEORGE INCH, MD OF MULTI-INDUSTRY SECTOR OF US AND
SENIOR ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Is there a way to qualify
and maybe quantify possibly the impact of sort of relatively stable crude
prices here? You guys have a decent amount of direct and indirect exposures,
and I'm just curious if -- how Tom and Darius, you would think about that or
articulate that?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. There's a lot of directional movement.
One minute, U.S. inventory is down. Then you have today, not such good news.
There's talk about Saudi holding back production. So we're -- every day, there
seems to be sort of a different data point which has an impact on the oil
prices. But the punchline for us is that it's something north of $40 and, if we
get some stability like we've had, then things are fine. If price of oil drops
below $40 and stays there for a bit, that would concern me. We'll see what
happens. There's a lot of moving pieces between continued expansion of the U.S.
shale production, between what OPEC is going to do, what's Libya and Nigeria,
what are they producing. What's Iran going to do. So there is a lot of moving
pieces here and it's hard to decipher exactly what decisions are going to be
made. I think this next OPEC meeting is going to be a very, very important one,
in which case, we can set some directionality. But overall, we -- as of right
now and as you can see from our order rates for both HPS and UOP, the market is
good. And the activity is very good. Very good second quarter and we're bullish
on the third quarter as well.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, I think, those portfolios had proven
to be fairly resistant to massive movement in the oil prices. And what I mean
by that, as we look at what the nature of where we participate, I mean, we're
in the midstream and downstream, almost exclusively in the downstream for UOP,
so refining and petrochemicals. I mean, those are areas that stood up very well
in the -- when oil was down at all-time lows. HPS, we're a little bit more in
midstream. But still, I think the positioning of our portfolios makes them
fairly resistant. I mean, not immune, I'm not trying to put that out there, but
the case has proven itself.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: Yes, Tom and you went through that when
oil was crashing, right? You went through a fairly elaborate exercise to sort
of basically pitch for the resilience of the portfolio. I'm just trying to
understand, we've had semi-reasonably stable oil prices. Are we seeing some
sort of a kind of a net tailwind that maybe, if oil stays here, it
anniversaries next year, so the benefit you're getting this year maybe
dissipates a little next year? I don't know, I'm just trying to put this into a
context, that's all.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, I mean, I would say that the market
has come back this year. It's unquestionable. But I don't think it's come back
in a V kind of a fashion. I would say the HPS and UOP teams are just doing
very, very well in terms of their performance. I mean what -- the kind of booking
rates that they are getting and we're seeing, I haven't seen from anybody else.
So I'm very pleased with how they're performing. But I still think that,
provided the oil price stays stable or maybe upticks, there could be a bit more
tailwinds here to come. So I'm optimistic and the pipeline that we have, in
terms of our quote log, makes me optimistic. Now obviously, that could change,
but right now, I'm fairly bullish on the market.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: Yes, that makes sense. So then just as a
follow-up. Darius, the portfolio review, are we still -- no one's asked about
it and you didn't really talk about it in your prepared remarks. Are we on
track for some sort of a presentation announcement? I think you've said by the
summer. And I just want to clarify, it's not going to be in the last week of
August, is it? I mean, by summer, do you mean when we get back from Labor Day?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: No. I just want to make sure everybody's on
holiday, no. No, I said late summer, early fall. It's that -- we're still
targeting, what I exact -- what I said was late summer, early fall. We're very
much tracking to that and that's when I'd anticipate some further clarity
around the portfolio.

JOHN GEORGE INCH: So don't change the vaca plans just yet.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: No, I think you're safe the last week of
August. Relax, all right. The beach is nice.

OPERATOR: And we have time for one final question that will
come from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY,
LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Many of my questions have been answered. But I did want
to ask, at the Paris Air Show and over the last couple of quarters, Boeing has
talked a lot about penetrating the service business and they've cited avionics
as one of the areas that they're trying to get more share of in the
aftermarket. And I just wanted to get your opinion on what form do you think
this takes? Is this more of an opportunity? Or is it a risk for Honeywell
longer term? And how do you guys approach this potential change in the
marketplace?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Well I -- yes, I think the clearest answer
is I'm not really sure yet because we haven't seen some of those plans yet
rolled out by Boeing. Boeing is very well respected within Honeywell as a
customer. We've partnered with Boeing on a number of things. They're a great
customer and we are going to do whatever we need to do to support them as a
customer. In terms of exactly what's going to happen and how they're going to
be going after their services business, I think, that's yet to be found out. So
to me there isn't that clear whether it's an opportunity or a threat. I will
tell you that our Connected Aircraft, which I think is something of value to
Boeing and a lot of the other OEMs, is something that's picking up pace very,
very quickly. I talked about the connected APU in my opening and that's getting
tremendous traction with customers. And by the way, that's only the beginning
in terms of our offerings for Connected Aircraft. We have many, many more
coming. So I think that, that's complementary to what Boeing is doing and some
of the other OEMs. So overall, I'm very positive on our continued strong
relationship with Boeing going forward.

OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's
question-and-answer session. At this time, we'd like to turn the conference
back to Mr. Darius Adamczyk for any additional closing comments.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Thank you. The second quarter was another
strong one for us with strong organic growth, margin expansion and continued
free cash flow momentum, which is up nearly 40% on a year-over-year basis. And
we were able to undertake some sizable restructuring projects that will benefit
our future performance. It was not a perfect quarter and we have several
opportunities that are well within our control to improve. There is a lot more
upside for Honeywell. And we will continue our focus on improving organic
growth, maintaining our productivity rigor, becoming a best-in-class software
industrial company and aggressively deploying capital. We also remain committed
to investing in our future, and we're looking forward to sharing more great
results with you in October. On behalf of the entire Honeywell team, we wish
you a pleasant and relaxing summer.

OPERATOR: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does
conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and
have a wonderful day.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
Honeywell's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As
a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

And I would now like to turn the conference over to your
host, Mr. Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead,
sir.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank
you, Derek. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's First Quarter 2017
Earnings Conference Call. With me here today are President and CEO, Darius
Adamczyk; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek.
This call and the webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are
available on our website at 

.

Note that elements of this presentation may contain
forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of
our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we ask that
you interpret them in that light to identify the principal risks and
uncertainties that affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and
other SEC filings.

This morning, we will review our financial results for the
first quarter, highlight some exciting accomplishments across the portfolio and
share our guidance for the second quarter of '17. And as always, we'll leave
ample time for your questions at the end.

So with that, I'll turn the call over to President and CEO,
Darius Adamczyk.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK, CEO, PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Today, we
reported a very strong start to 2017. We met, or in most cases, exceeded our
guidance ranges and I'm pleased with our results in the first quarter. We
recorded earnings per share of $1.66, normalized at our expected full year tax
rate. This is $0.02 above the high end of the guidance we provided in January.
Excluding divestitures and normalizing for tax, EPS was up 11% versus 2016 or
10% on a reported basis. Organic sales were up more than 2%, and we recorded
double-digit revenue growth in Advanced Materials [ with ] Performance
Technologies, on demand for our Solstice product line. And we saw continued
strength in UOP as the oil and gas end markets improved.

In Home and Building Technologies, our global distribution
business continued to outpace the market. While the products business generated
strong results at 3% organic growth.

In Aerospace, we had strong performance in the aftermarket,
particularly in air transport on robust repair and overhaul activity and in
Safety and Productivity Solutions. We saw growth in most of the businesses with
particularly noteworthy performance exhibited in workflow solutions, sensing
and IoT as well as industrial safety.

We expanded segment margins by 70 basis points. We're
delivering high-value offerings to our customers, and our execution is
improving as the ongoing benefits of our HOS Gold operating systems
materialize. We also continue to optimize our cost structure by highlighting
our March Investor Day, driven by productivity initiatives and the
restructuring actions we took through 2016.

Driving segment margin improvement continues to be an
ongoing focus for Honeywell. We delivered significant improvement in free cash
flow year-over-year, largely driven by improved working capital performance.
Free cash flow performance will continue to be a key priority for Honeywell. We
have a renewed level of focus on working capital at all levels across the
company, and we expect we will drive improved free cash flow conversion in
every business.

Given the strong performance, we are raising the low end of
our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 to $6.90 to $7.10 and reaffirming our 2017
organic sales, segment origin and free cash flow guidance. We are encouraged by
the first quarter growth and execution, but are taking a tempered approach to
our forward outlook given the potential volatility in our end markets and
limited view of the year at this time.

Each of our business had significant commercial achievements
in the first quarter. On Slide 3, I'd like to highlight some of them.

In Aerospace, together with Airbus, we announced that our
auxiliary power unit is now standard equipment on the A320 family of aircraft
replacing a competitor's APU as the base option. Airbus selected Honeywell
because of our APU's superior reliability and fuel savings capability. In
addition, both Japan Airlines and India's Jet Airways announced that they are
using our GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software. Fuel consumption typically
accounts for more -- for as much as 20% to 40% of our airlines' operating
costs, and GoDirect can help customers save more than 2% annually.

In Home and Building Technologies, we launched MAXPRO Cloud
for Connected Buildings. MAXPRO provides streamlined video and access
management to our customers that manage multiple buildings. In addition,
Honeywell Building Solutions announced contracts to improve energy efficiency
at 21 U.S. federal aviation administration facilities and at the U.S. Air Force
base in Los Angeles as well as airport wins in emerging regions, including
Turkey and Singapore.

In Performance Materials and Technologies, UOP technologies
and Honeywell Process Solutions controls were selected in China for one of the
largest crude-to-chemicals complexes in the world. In addition, UOP will
provide the process technology for the largest Oleflex units in Europe. And
UOP's hydrotreating catalyst will be used by Wantong Petrochemical to produce
cleaner-burning, ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel without a costly modification of
its existing hydrotreating unit.

As you will hear shortly, the orders thus far for

PMT have been very strong. Our customers recognize the value
of Honeywell's technologies, and this is allowing us to win the marketplace,
especially in China.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, we introduced
AutoCube, a 3D dimensioning system that helps customers instantly capture the
volume of parcels to enable space optimization in volume-based pricing. Safety
and Productivity Solutions also won 4 prestigious International Forum iF Design
Awards recognizing our product design focus and the Honeywell User Experience.

As you know, driving organic sales growth is one of my key
priorities. I'm pleased with the results we saw in the first quarter. Investing
in development of new products, breakthrough initiatives and commercial
excellence will help us accelerate our momentum.

With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to discuss our financial
results in more detail.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK, CFO AND SVP, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL
INC.: Thanks, Darius. I'm on Slide 4. As Darius mentioned, we delivered more
than 2% organic sales growth this quarter. Now truth be told, we're actually
within inches of 3%, but it did come out at 2%. All of our segments were at or
above the high end of the sales guidance we provided back in January, so a
strong start from a growth perspective.

Segment profit was up 8%, excluding divestitures, and
segment margins expanded 70 basis points from 2016. This accounted for the bulk
of the EPS expansion, as you'll see in a minute. The segment profit growth was driven
by sales improvement, our ongoing productivity initiatives, the benefits from
the significant restructuring programs that were funded in 2016 and overall
front-end commercial excellence.

Reported earnings per share of $1.71 were up 10%. This $1.71
includes a $0.05 benefit from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate. So for proper
comparability and to remove all tax favorability from our results, we've
normalized 2016 to reflect the expected 2017 full year tax rate and to
eliminate the $0.05 from 2016 relating to the divested businesses. On that
basis, EPS was up 11% or -- to $1.66. And that's, as Darius said, $0.02 above
the high end of the guidance range.

Free cash performance was also encouraging in the quarter.
As Darius mentioned, the entire organization at all levels is focused on our
working capital performance. We're breaking down our order-to-cash processes
into myriad of subsegments. And we're systematically measuring and improving
the cycle time of each of those subsegments. We're adjusting incentives to
foster more improvement in working capital, and we have a standard operating
cadence that culminates in a monthly review with Darius and me by each
business.

There's still much to do in this area. And while it is still
early in the year, we're encouraged by our progress so far. So overall, a very
strong start to 2017, but still a lot of opportunity for further improvement
over the next 3 quarters.

Let's move to Slide 5 and discuss each of the segments. In
Aerospace, we finished the quarter above the high end of our first quarter
sales guidance range, driven primarily by a strong performance in the air
transport aftermarket. We saw an uplift in spares demand and strength in repair
and overhaul activities with our airline customers, particularly in the sale of
repairs, modifications and upgrades, that resulted in high single-digit growth
rate in the ATR aftermarket. The aftermarket and Business and General Aviation
was roughly flat with stronger-than-anticipated R&O and connectivity
revenue, largely offset by a decline in spares. Our OE performance was as
expected, with volumes to our air transport customers up slightly on the
strength of A350 shipments, offset by declines in Business and General
Aviation. Defense sales were roughly flat, with strong organic sales growth in
our core U.S. and international defense businesses, offset by space and
commercial helicopter weakness. And there was continued strength in light
vehicle gas turbo penetration, particularly driven by new launches in Europe
and China. As well, there were some encouraging signs in the on-highway
commercial vehicle market globally and most notably, in China and in Europe.

Aerospace segment margin expansion for the quarter of 90
basis points also exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by
productivity, commercial excellence and the favorable impact of the divestiture
of the government services business in 2016. Overall, a very strong start to
2017 for Aerospace.

Home and Building Technologies generated organic sales
growth of 3%, driven by a strong performance in Environmental & Energy
Solutions, Security and Fire and our global distribution businesses. Growth in
the China business in HBT was nearly 15% this quarter. That was led by the
clean air and water product portfolios in EMS. We continue to see momentum in
the residential real estate market in China and anticipate continued
infrastructure investment that will help drive future growth.

Across HBT, there was gradual sales improvement over the
quarter with decent exit momentum. Segment margin, while below our expectation,
was still quite strong at 70 basis points improvement, stemming from our
ongoing productivity initiatives and the restructuring actions taken in the
second half of 2016. The mixed dynamics of sales in the quarter were a bit less
favorable than we anticipated.

Performance Materials and Technologies had a very strong
quarter: sales up 5% on an organic basis, margins expanded 260 basis points and
orders were up double digits. The performance was led by Advanced Materials
where Solstice sales growth exceeded 150% on an organic basis, enabled by the
capital investments we've made over the past several years.

Sales in UOP were up 3% organic, led by gas processing.
There continues to be increasing interest in domestic modular units, in
particular. In the first quarter alone, we signed 6 new deals in the U.S. for
pre-engineered cryogenic plants that separate natural gas liquid. This compares
favorability to the 12 units we had for all of 2016, including 2 in the first
quarter.

Growth in the catalyst business was at low single digits,
driven by new Oleflex units. The orders in UOP were up over 15% in the first
quarter, setting the stage for continued performance in this business.

Sales in Process Solutions were roughly flat on an organic
basis. We had healthy customer adoption of our Assurance 360 service offering
and good growth in our life cycle solutions and services business. This was
offset by slower sales in our large projects business. Orders in HPS were up
nearly 10% on an organic basis.

The margin expansion of PMT was driven by productivity,
commercial excellence initiatives and the impact of the spin-off of the former
Resins and Chemicals business in 2016. So all in all, a great result for PMT
and encouraging forward indicators across all of its business units.

Finally, in SPS. Organic sales were up 3%, exceeding the
high end of our guidance range. Industrial safety, the largest business within
SPS, drew -- grew 4% on an organic basis, driven by our high risk and gas detection
offerings. There was also significant growth in our workflow solutions business
due to strong demand and improved supply chain execution.

Growth in our IoT business was also strong, with good
performance in a number of regions. And Intelligrated grew an excess of 20%
this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2016 when it was not owned by
Honeywell. And this was driven by large projects in a number of key accounts.

Excluding the first year dilutive impact from M&A, SPS
segment margins expanded more than 300 basis points, driven by continued
productivity and restructuring benefits and the conversion on a strong sales
volume. We're encouraged by the trends that we saw in the first quarter in SPS
and in the rest of the portfolio.

Slide 6 contains a walk of our EPS from the first quarter of
2016 to the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of last year, earnings
from our 2016 divestitures were $0.05, and we exclude those amounts from the
2016 baseline, consistent with the 2017 earnings guidance framework we
provided. For comparison purposes, as I said earlier, we've also normalized the
tax rate for first quarter of 2016 for the expected 2017 full year tax rate,
and this effect was minor, as you can see.

In the first quarter of 2017, the segment improvement I
highlighted for each business accounted for $0.12 of the year-over-year
improvement in earnings per share. Below-the-line items and a slightly lower
share count contributed $0.04 this quarter, bringing our 2017 EPS, excluding
benefits from the lower tax rate, to $1.66, which is that $0.02 beat to the
$1.64 high end of our first quarter guidance. EPS increased 11% year-over-year
on this basis. And for the full year, we expect our share count to be
consistent with the 772 million shares we projected in January.

Regarding tax. Our planned tax rate for the quarter was
about 25%, but the actual rate was 22.7% with the difference contributing an
additional $0.05 of EPS growth, resulting in reported EPS of $1.71. Our
expectation is that the effective tax rate in quarters 2, 3 and 4 will be at or
above 25%. And to the extent that changed, we'll provide an update.

Let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss what we're seeing in our
end markets heading into the second quarter. Last quarter, we told you about
some encouraging trends in our oil and gas businesses, and those have continued
this quarter. The combined UOP and HPS book-to-bill ratio was strong at 1.15.
And UOP orders, as I said earlier, were up over 15%, driven by our gas
processing business. The domestic Russell business has outpaced our
expectations as the demand for nongas liquid separation technology strengthens
in the U.S. There are also more orders for licensing, which is typically one of
the first indicators that the oil and gas cycle is restarting. The activity in
UOP China has been particularly strong, and we've won a number of key projects,
which will allow us to leverage the capacity investments we've made over the
past few years.

Within Home and Building Technologies in the second quarter,
we anticipate several large smart meter project rollouts in Europe and better
backlog conversion in the Americas. Smart meter business came to Honeywell as
part of the Elster acquisition, and it continues to perform well. Overall, the
short-cycle demand in the commercial and residential segments continues to be
robust.

The aviation market continues to be resilient with the
high-end, single-digit growth driven by spares demand and repairs,
modifications and upgrades in the Air Transport and Regional business. This is
supported by the outlook for continued flight hour growth of 4% to 5% in Air
Transport and Regional.

In the Business and General Aviation market, we had strong
demand in the repair and overhaul business, but weaker performance in spares,
driven by a continued decline in maintenance events. We expect continued
aftermarket strength heading into the second quarter, with the airlines
business growing faster than BGA. Flight hours in BGA are likely to remain flat
to down in 2017. Our connectivity business grew double digits in the first
quarter and will continue to be a source of strength for aftermarket revenues.

We were encouraged by the increased activity in our
businesses that serve the industrial sector. Our industrial safety business was
up mid-single digits, driven by demand for gas detection and high risk safety
equipment. The backlog and pipeline of future orders at Intelligrated continues
to be strong, and we're encouraged about the prospects for 2017. As planned, we
expect lower shipments and fewer engine maintenance events than 2016 for
Business Jets. We continue to plan conservatively and do not anticipate a
recovery until the 2018, 2019 time frame.

I'm now on Slide 9 (sic) [ Slide 8 ] with a preview of the
second quarter. In Aerospace, sales are expected to be in the flat to down 2%
range on an organic basis, with continued strength from the ATR aftermarket and
solid demand in the U.S. core defense. In Transportation Systems, we anticipate
continued recovery in the commercial vehicles business combined with growth in
light vehicle gas applications, especially in China. These benefits will be
offset by the ongoing secular softness in the BGA and space markets. We expect
reported sales will be down 5% to 7% due to the 2016 divestiture of the government
service business.

Aero margin expansion will be driven primarily by the
benefits from our 2016 restructuring projects and a stronger mix of aftermarket
growth. Importantly, the second quarter is expected to be the last quarter of
the headwind associated with OEM incentives. In the second half, they become an
approximate $70 million tailwind to sales and segment margin as compared to an
approximate $25 million headwind in the first half.

In Home and Building Technologies, reported sales are
expected to be down 1% to up 1%, due to impacts of foreign currency
translation. With organic sales growth up 2% to 4%, driven by the large Elster
smart meter rollouts I mentioned earlier. In the other products businesses, we
expect continued contribution from new product introductions, like our T Series
thermostat and do-it-yourself security products, which were on display earlier
this month at ISC WEST.

In China, we again expect double-digit growth, driven by
continued air and water demand and growth in Security and Fire systems
associated with large real estate projects. We also expect continued strength
in our global distribution business and stronger growth in Building Solutions.

HBT segment margins are expected to expand 70 to 100 basis
points, driven by cost reductions from prior restructuring actions, commercial
excellence and ongoing productivity initiatives, partially offset by product
mix headwinds associated with the strength of our distribution sales.

In PMT, we anticipate continued strong performance across the
group with 3% to 5% organic sales growth. Advanced Materials is expected to be
up significantly on continued demand for Solstice low-global-warming products.

In UOP, improving oil and gas markets and the strong backlog
will drive continued growth, primarily in licensing and equipment sales. We
also expect modest growth in the Process Solutions business, driven primarily
by our short-cycle software and service offerings. On a reported basis, PMT
sales are expected to be down year-over-year due to the spin-off of Resins and
Chemicals business in the fourth quarter. The projected segment margin
expansion of 170 to 200 basis points is driven by higher volumes, productivity
and the impact of the spin-off of the former Resins and Chemicals business.

In Safety and Productivity Solutions, sales are expected to
be up flat or to be flat-to-up 2% on an organic basis, with reported sales
increasing north of 25% due to the impact of the Intelligrated acquisition. The
organic growth will be slightly lower quarter-to-quarter as the significant
workflow solutions growth we saw from improved supply chain execution in the
first quarter normalizes in the second quarter. In the safety business, growth
in the industrial business will be driven by new product introductions and better
end-market outlooks.

In Intelligrated, orders were strong exiting the first
quarter, and we anticipate double-digit growth to continue. SPS margins are
expected to expand by more than 250 basis points, excluding the first year
dilutive impacts of M&A, driven primarily by benefits from last year's
restructuring projects and by the sales growth and ongoing productivity
initiatives.

For the company in total, we're expecting EPS of $1.75 to
$1.80, which will be up 7% to 10% year-over-year, excluding 2016 divestitures
and normalizing for our expected full year tax rate. Organic sales growth is
anticipated to be flat to 2%, with 50 to 80 basis points of margin expansion.
We expect that reported sales will be down 1% to 3% due to the 2016 portfolio
actions I mentioned.

Let me move to Slide 9. As Darius mentioned, we're raising
the low end of our full year EPS guide by $0.05 to $6.90 to $7.10, up 7% to
10%, excluding divestitures. At a total Honeywell level, we continue to
anticipate delivering between 70 and 110 basis points of margin expansion for
the full year, driven by slightly better performance in aerospace and PMT,
overcoming a slower start in HBT.

Let me turn to Slide 10 for a brief wrap-up. In summary, we
delivered a high-quality first quarter result with all of our segments
contributing to the performance. Our end markets continue to improve across our
businesses, and our execution is getting better as well. We expect second
quarter earnings to grow 7% to 10% year-over-year, excluding divestitures and normalized
for tax, and we raised the low end of our full year EPS guide by $0.05. Our
business is to continue to win in growing end markets, the investments we've
made in 2016, including the significant restructuring projects, are also
delivering for us. And our Honeywell operating system is continuing to drive
commercial gains and productivity improvements. We're well positioned to
continue to outperform for the remainder of 2017.

So with that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.

MARK MACALUSO: Thanks, Tom. Darius and Tom are both now
available to answer your questions. So Derek, can we open up the lines for
Q&A?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes
from Mr. Scott Davis with Barclays.

SCOTT REED DAVIS, MD AND HEAD OF GLOBAL INDUSTRIALS EQUITY
RESEARCH, BARCLAYS PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: If we can talk -- can you guys just
remind us where we are with the big UOP and Solstice capacity adds? And when --
I know you've been taking orders, but when do you really see the lion's share of
that revenue ramp from maybe each one of those is a separate question? But I'll
just leave it at that.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, so I would say that the [ big ] -- the
facility that we've been building for the last couple of the year comes online
at the end of Q2, early Q3, which is really the last portion of the capacity
expansion. And as we saw, starting early this year, with the MAC initiative
kicking in, in Europe, we saw nice volume ramp up and our Solstice product line
is up double digits so far this year. And we expect that to continue and even
accelerate further as we head into '17 and further into '18. But I think that
the short answer here is that as we get into the second half of 2017, we're
going to be exactly where we need to be from a capacity perspective.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: And I'd add, Scott, to that, that the
orders are supporting that. I mean, we had, as we mentioned, double-digit
orders growth in PMT overall, and it was across all the businesses, but
especially in the ones where we're making those capacity investments. And the
backlog is picking up nicely.

SCOTT REED DAVIS: So help us just understand, I mean, at
what kind of capacity utilization will you be at? Or how does that -- I mean,
are you profitable with those new orders in the first year? Or is it taking
until you get to a certain percent capacity utilization? And just help us
understand that, and that'll be it for me.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think with any new process
start-up, I mean, we're obviously not going to be operating at full capacity
because -- and we had planned for that, and things are going to be ramped up.
But I would say we're targeting well north of 80% once we get into 2018 and
beyond. And frankly, we can bring even more capacity online as we secure new
orders. We think that Solstice, we've done a really nice job securing orders
and a lot of that I would say are developed markets. But we see a lot of
potential in our HGR markets as well given the acceptance of some of the Paris
outcome. And we have some extra capacity that we can bring to bear to generate
revenue. And we also have plans for further expansions should some of those
regulations be enacted, which we think that there is a very good chance that,
that will happen.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with
JPMorgan.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA, MD, JP MORGAN CHASE & CO, RESEARCH
DIVISION: So you guys did about $0.12 of kind of continuing ops improvement
year-over-year in the first quarter. I think you had these OEM incentives. What
were the OEM incentives in the first quarter? I know you said $25 million in
the first half. What were they in the first quarter?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. They were very -- they were minor.
Year-over-year impact was minor on OEM incentives in the first quarter.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. So that will be in the second
quarter.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: (inaudible) the second quarter, you'll
see that.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. When we look at kind of the
second half of the year versus the first half of the year, I mean, you're doing
$0.12 year-over-year in these kind of core businesses. In the first quarter,
maybe it's a little bit less than that because the OEM incentive is in the
second quarter, although your guidance wouldn't suggest that. Just remind us,
is there anything in the second half other than the OEM incentives that makes
the year-over-year comp tougher? Seems to me like the second half kind of
dropped off a bit, so you have easier year-over-year comps there. Is there
anything we should consider, whether it's mix or orders timing or anything like
that? Or should that kind of $0.12 or whatever you do here in the first half
actually be better in the second half of the year?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. I think the incentives, clearly as I
said, a drag in the first half, a nice tailwind in the second half and that
will continue into '18 and '19. We do get a ramp up of repositioning in the
second half. And then the -- we're continuing to integrate the acquisition.
We're still actively integrating 9 deals, including Intelligrated, and those
tend to get better as the year progresses in terms of operating margin
improvement when those synergies kick in. But I'd say those are the major
impacts first half, second half.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: So those are all good guys from a run
rate perspective.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, they should be helpful.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: No, I was just going to say, Steve, that we
can't point to any specific headwinds other than frankly, market uncertainty.
And although we're excited about, frankly, about the kind of long-term orders,
that performance we had in Q1, most of our business is short cycle. And I think
the environment is probably fairly volatile, so we're being a little bit
tempered of our expectations for the second half. And given that it's kind of
week 3 into the new role, it's -- we're being a little bit, I would say,
tempered around our expectations but certainly excited about the kind of start
we had here.

CHARLES STEPHEN TUSA: I think -- yes, I would agree. I mean,
it looks like your guidance suggests very minimal kind of run rate improvement,
so a smart move, only being in the seat for a few weeks.

OPERATOR: And next from Morgan Stanley, we'll hear from
Nigel Coe.

NIGEL EDWARD COE, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: So
just want to pick up on Steve's last question about the sort of (inaudible).
And Darius, you mentioned the environment is uneven, volatile. Is that a
reference to kind of what happened second half of last year: 3Q, very weak; 4Q
came back; and then 1Q, back to the races. Is that what you're referring to or
you're seeing intra-quarter volatility during 1Q? I'm just -- and then on top
of that, maybe if you can just kind of color in sort of the -- what you're
seeing today versus what you saw back in December when you put the plan together.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. No, I -- to answer the first part of
your question, no, actually it's nothing to do with Q3 or Q4 last year. And I
would say overall, and I think consistent with what I said at Investor Day, the
environment in 2017 is better than 2016. I think we certainly see that in PMT.
We see it in HBT, SPS and so on. I would also temper that and say it's not
dramatically better. But it's better, but not -- it's certainly not at the kind
of a recovery. In terms of comps versus December and how we feel today versus
back then, I think maybe the only thing that's a little bit different is that
-- I think Dave sort of called it kind of the expectations around what's going
to happen around tax reform. They've been tempered a little bit as well. We continue
to remain optimistic that things will happen. But I would say that there was
almost a clear expectations. And now I think there's a little bit more
hesitancy. We have the elections in France coming up this weekend. There's
still quite a bit of uncertainty in terms of geopolitical environment at the
moment.

NIGEL EDWARD COE: Yes, for sure. And then just digging into
TS in a little bit more detail. You referenced, Tom, the commercial vehicle
tails on highway, and I'm assuming off-highway, too. And then, obviously, we
have a continued growth and penetration in gas. But then offsetting that, we've
got a little bit of LV production headwinds in the second half, maybe even 2Q.
And then diesel penetration in Europe seems to be ticking down. So I'm just wondering
how should we sort of stitch that together in thinking about TS growth for the
back half of the year.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes. I think you've got all the factors
laid out there, Nigel. The overall global market will probably be flattish to
up a little bit in terms of total production. So when you look at the way we've
model it out, I would say that the second quarter is not inconsistent with what
you can expect for the rest of the year for TS.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank
of America.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN, MD, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH
DIVISION: Can you hear me?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, we can.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: So just a question on free cash flow.
Very impressive first quarter. Can you just provide us with more insight as to
what are the areas that you're looking for improvement? What businesses you're
targeting? What accounts? And what should we see throughout the year?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, sure. Well, first quarter for us,
the biggest driver, as we said, was improved working capital performance. We
saw that particularly in PMT and in Aerospace. But I think we're just -- we're
at the outset, there. That's going to be the major area of focus for us in
terms of driving improved free cash flow conversion. You've also got the CapEx.
And as you know, we were at the peaks in 2016, into 2017. That starts to
moderate as the investments that Darius was talking about earlier ramp down and
we get into the full run mode, particularly in PMT. And with the combination of
those 2 things, we expect to continue to drive that conversion higher.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Just to add, and I would just emphasize the
part that working capital is -- so your renewed level of emphasis in all
Honeywell in your question around which businesses, I think all of them have an
opportunity. I mean, we're driving receivables, inventory in all these
businesses. I think PMT particularly is noteworthy. They did a really nice job
in their receivables. A part of that is due to the recovery in the oil and gas
markets, where some of our customers are recovering and they've made really,
really nice progress in Q1. And by the way, there's more to do. So I expect
progress in all 4 of the SBGs going forward.

ANDREW BURRIS OBIN: And just a follow-up question then on
PMT. Great commentary on UOP. But generally, what are you guys seeing on large
project discussions? And maybe outside of UOP, and maybe you could just go
around the world just to give us some color as to what you're seeing.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, I mean, overall, actually nice orders
performance: high single-digit up for HPS; teens, high teens up for UOP. So
we're seeing the order activity returning. I would characterize the orders kind
of being medium-sized, so we didn't have the mega orders like we did in the last
12 to 18 months, which HPS has won. These would be kind of the medium-sized
awards. We actually didn't see the base business be as strong as we like it to.
So this would be kind of the midsized order activity. As we look at it region
by region, South America continues to be relatively soft. The Middle East has
had a nice comeback. China, very, very strong performance in the first quarter.
Won a lot of work there, and that continues to come back. Also, the U.S.,
especially in our GP&H business in UOP, which is well correlated to the
activity in the unconventional segment. And as you see, the rig count being up,
I think, 80% in the U.S. and much more than that in Canada. We saw very, very
strong order activity in GP&H business with the cryo plants. So overall, as
the oil price stabilized here at $50, $50 plus, and we're encouraged by some of
the news we're hearing about the production freezes that OPEC is encouraging
its members to do, I think that this is going to continue to be a tailwind for
us for the rest of the year.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague
with Vertical Research Partners.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE, FOUNDER AND MANAGING PARTNER, VERTICAL
RESEARCH PARTNERS, LLC: Just a couple of things for me. I wonder if you could
just elaborate a little bit more on what's going on with Intelligrated.
Obviously, I think we're all aware of kind of the e-commerce effect on retail
and its knock-on effects to distribution. But really, my question is how much
of the strength that you're seeing relates to Intelligrated now being part of
Honeywell and you being able to open it up into other areas? Or should we think
of this as a kind of truly organic Intelligrated as it stands now? And if the
answer is it's really kind of just legacy Intelligrated, maybe a little bit
more color on the integration of the business and how you see the growth going
forward.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think it's both, Jeff, because for
example, one of the elements where we're investing in heavily right now is
Intelligrated was predominantly a U.S. business. And we're globalizing that
business, investing in it, say, metro-sizing it. And we see the international
growth as a big opportunity for us in the future (inaudible). Now that doesn't
come through in the form of big orders yet. But I can tell you that a lot of
the big customers that we currently have in the U.S., they would want us to
have a much broader global presence. And we've invested in that, and we expect
to materialize that. In terms of overall business performance. I think I would
describe it in one word, terrific. This business has substantially exceeded any
financial metrics we've had for it and continues to impress us with its rate of
growth. And we see strong double-digit growth rate, both in revenue and bookings
for this year. And I -- the more I learn about it, the more of the customers of
this business I meet, the more excited I get. I think that we have a very
exciting growth profile for this business, both in terms of making it more
global, expanding our software solutions, expanding our [ plane ] robotics.
There are a lot of different directions to go, both organically and potentially
inorganically.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: And the other thing I'd add in terms of
the Honeywell value is the -- those aftermarket kinds of positionings. I mean,
the installed base, we've mentioned 20% sales growth this quarter. Backlog is
up strongly in the double digits. We're building a big installed base there and
developing that aftermarket business model. In addition to what Darius mentioned
about Europe, it's going to be a nice driver for Intelligrated growth.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: And Jeff, maybe just one last thing to add
is -- and this is -- I highlighted this before, but just to reinforce. The
sweet spot of the Intelligrated business is e-commerce. It's high throughput,
high-speed package processing which, as you know, is the segment that's growing
the fastest right now. So this business is exactly in the sweet spot of where
the big growth sector is at the moment.

JEFFREY TODD SPRAGUE: And then just a separate unrelated
question. On UOP, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the licensing
uptick you're seeing? What verticals is that? And any color on what's going on
in the refinery turnaround and chemical plant turnaround landscape?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. I would say that the big uptick is in
petrochemical, particularly in China, is a place I would point to. We've had a
lot of recent successes, much larger integrated complexes. And the combination
of HPS and UOP is working very well. We've got a number of wins there and a
very, very strong Q1. So as the economy grows, so does the demand for the
petrochemicals. And I would point to that as one of the highlights of the
booking activity here in Q1 and certainly China. India has been good, but
really, strength across the globe. And even some activity returning in the
Middle East, which is really nice to see.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Deane Dray with
RBC Capital Markets.

DEANE M. DRAY, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH
DIVISION: For the -- your 4 priorities that you laid out at the outlook, we're
not expecting you to touch and check off every box every quarter, but we did
see the accelerated organic revenues, you got that; expanding margins, you got
that. Certainly more excitement and traction around being a software
industrial. Maybe not hearing much here this morning about more aggressive
capital deployment. But -- so maybe you could just touch on that. What kind of
expectations do you want to set over the near term?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think on capital deployment,
as I promised, that is one of the core initiatives. Frankly, we continue to be
very active. The pipeline for M&A deals is very, very active. But things
are a little bit expensive out there, so we're being cautious. Because as I
pointed out on Investor Day, we do want to be active and secure the right
deals, but we also want to continue to be prudent buyers, not overspend. And
that's frankly why maybe we haven't announced some of the -- any deals yet this
year. But rest assured, we're very, very active. In terms of buybacks, timing,
and we're committed to having a flat share count, as we said, and potentially
do even more later in the year. So timing is everything from that perspective.
So yes, it's been a little bit quiet, but you've got to also remember that I'm
only about 3 weeks into the role. So probably -- I'm pleased with some of the
levers actually coming through in our results in Q1.

DEANE M. DRAY: Got it. And then just as a follow-up. One of
the goals that you've set is on the new product vitality index, expect to track
to 20% in 2017, an uptick from last year. How did the first quarter play out?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: I think it played out well. But in full
transparency, I would say most of our new product launches are really back-end
loaded this year. We have some things coming out in Q3. Q3 will be a very, very
new product launch quarter. So I think in fairness, I'll have to be in a better
position to answer that question as we get deeper into the year. Because right
now, it's really too early to tell, and I don't want to declare a success until
we see how some of the bigger, even more exciting new product launches happen
in Q2, and especially in Q3, which is going to be a big launch quarter for us.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Gautam Khanna
with Cowen & Company.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY,
LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Wanted to ask if you can characterize any of the
channels that may have any destocking still going on. Previously, you'd talked
about S&PS. Wonder if that's abated. And recently, we heard some other
aerospace companies talking about destocking on some of the aircraft programs,
87, 777, A380, et cetera. If you're seeing any of that? Or if you expect to?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. I mean, I think, let me comment on
kind of on [ SPS ]. I think we've kind of see this continuation of destocking
and frankly, that some of our distribution partners are operating at a lower
inventory levels than what we're historically have seen. That's certainly true
in SPS. In aero, I'm not sure we've noticed that as much. It think that, that's
been fairly steady, at least for us, and that's exhibited by the fact that,
frankly, we performed a little bit better than we projected for Q1 and
especially in the aftermarket segment of the business, which has been very,
very strong. And we're very pleased with it. So I'm not sure -- I'm not sure
that we've seen it in Q1.

GAUTAM J. KHANNA: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the
M&A question from earlier. Are you seeing any areas that are more promising
than others? If you could comment on where valuations are perhaps more
stretched versus more attractive? I'm looking at your segments.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Well, I guess, unfortunately, they're
pretty stretched everywhere. The market is pretty warm right now. There's a lot
of cash sitting around, both on the private equity as well as the strategics. I
wouldn't say that anything is particularly cheap at the moment. Now having said
that, we have a very, very big pipeline. And we have a lot of different options
in terms of the segments that we're looking at. And I can tell you that we have
attractive deals that we're looking for in every one of our SPGs. Now what
actually lands or what happens, we'll see. But I would say overall, things are
a bit expensive. There's no question about that. And I don't think that, that's
a comment that's end-market specific. That's true really across our entire
portfolio.

OPERATOR: The next question, we'll hear from Joe Ritchie
with Goldman Sachs.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE, VP AND LEAD MULTI-INDUSTRY ANALYST,
GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So Tom, you mentioned inches,
inches this quarter on the organic growth side. It sounds like the order growth
across a lot of your segments right now is going in a positive way. You've
looked at the comps for next quarter. Looks pretty easy. I'm just trying to
understand, I guess, the guidance, the flat to 2% organic growth guidance for
2Q. It just kind of seems like a layup based on the commentary and based on the
comps. So maybe a little bit more color there would be helpful.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, that's fine, Joe. I mean, we sort of
had a sense that, that would be a question. When you look at our businesses overall,
long cycle is about 40%. Short cycle is about 60%. So yes, we're still in the
environment on the short-cycle side where the demand patterns are not quite
consistent. The word volatility was used before. I mean, it's not exactly
something that we have good extended sight into on that short-cycle side. But
with that, if you look at it by each business, I mean, Aerospace is more
long-cycle oriented, with the exception of the aftermarket. So fairly well
grounded. We did flat in Q1. We're calling minus 3% to minus 1% for Q2. That's
mostly OE-related. You have those incentives coming through. As we mentioned,
that's -- that the bulk of the first half incentives hit us in the -- in that
second quarter. You've got regional. That's, on the OE side, that's been fairly
weak. And BGA continues to be kind of in that flattish range. From an HBT
perspective, short cycle, we're a little bit more cautious. So yes, we did 3%
in Q1. We're calling 1% to 3% in Q2. Let's see how that -- let's see how the
demand patterns emerge over the quarter. I'd say the same thing for SPS,
although there are a couple of things going on there. So SPS was 3%. First
quarter, we're calling 0 to 2% in Q2. We've got a change in our go-to-market
model on the retail side, and we're going more direct to our customers. And as
a result, there's some timing patterns in the channels. We also had, as I
mentioned, significant improvement in the first quarter on workflow solutions
supply chain. So there was strong demand, but there was some unintended backlog
at the end of the fourth quarter that we worked our way through, and that
helped Q1 specifically on SPS. So that tempers a little bit. And then lastly,
on PMT. I think the -- it's fairly well grounded given the backlogs. So 3% --
or sorry, 5% in Q1, 3% to 5% in Q2. Certainly, Darius and I talk to Rajeev
every day about this. So we have the sort of the same expectation, and we'll do
a little bit better there. But we just want to be cautious on demand on some of
the Advanced Materials. It's been going like gang busters, as I said, 150%
improvement on those Solstice sales. And I don't want to just bank on that
every single quarter going forward.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. And Joe, maybe just to add a couple of
comments. I think as you look at our long-cycle business and our backlog, we're
very encouraged by what we saw in Q1, backlog being up pretty much for every
one of those businesses. So certainly, there's a level of confidence in what
we're seeing on the long cycle. The short cycle is a slightly different story,
and we're positive on the short cycle, too. But if you think about kind of the
animal spirits that we saw overall in the markets, particularly in the U.S. in,
let's say, January versus what we see now, I would say that's a slight down
arrow versus what it was. And I think some of that could be reflected in the
short cycle. And frankly, we're being a little bit cautious and measured in
terms of our outlook and what we hope to deliver to the upside of what we
stated.

JOSEPH ALFRED RITCHIE: Got it. No, that's an interesting
observation on the bifurcation there. I guess, the follow-up question, I guess,
is maybe even slightly similar, is really on the cash flow side. Seasonally
incredibly strong. It didn't sound like you guys called out any onetime items this
quarter. What's stopping you from potentially raising the cash flow guidance
for the year?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, I mean, so we're calling 5% to 7%
growth in the -- for the full year guide, Joe. As you know, the first quarter
was 6x. First quarter is generally our most volatile quarter when it comes to
cash. Now couple that with these new initiatives that we've put in place around
working capital. You did see some significant uptick. I guess, we want to see a
sustained level of performance. Let's see where we are at the end of Q2, and
let's see whether we're really sticking with the working capital improvements
that we've seen. But I have a bias, like you do, that, that could get better as
the year progresses.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. I think I'd agree with what Tom said.
I mean I -- we need to see sustained performance. One quarter doesn't make a
year. And although we're very encouraged by what we saw in Q1, I need to see it
continue in Q2. And frankly, if we see continued sustained performance like
that at the end of Q2, we're going to revisit our guidance at the conclusion of
the second quarter.

OPERATOR: And next question comes from Howard Rubel with
Jefferies.

HOWARD ALAN RUBEL, MD AND SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST OF
AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE ELECTRONICS, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two
things. First, maybe you could talk a little bit about the progress with
connectivity? How many installs you have? And sort of what kind of customer
feedback you're now getting with that business? It's becoming a little more
prevalent in the marketplace.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. And I think -- Howard, we're building
out our organization. We saw a couple of key hires in Que Dallara and Stephen
Gold join us in very senior leadership spots. We're building out our offerings.
And whether it's Connected Aircraft, where we've had a number of wins that we
highlighted in the report today, whether it's Connected Homes, Buildings,
Connected Plant, we've signed up multiple partners. So I'm not sure that we
really measure it yet in terms of the number of connections we have. We measure
it by the number of customer engagements we have, kind of interactions we have.
And frankly, some of the connected enterprises are ahead of the others. I would
classify Connected Aircraft, Connected Plant are a little bit further ahead,
and some of the others still a little more behind. But I can tell you that for
all of them, we're at a stage where we're engaging customers or optimizing our
solutions and iterating, iterating quickly. The way to grow this business is to
have hypothesis; talk to customers, iterate and bring the value. Because in
many instances, the customers don't -- they can't define exactly what they're
looking for. So we have a hypothesis that we optimize and optimize. But very,
very big build-out in this organization. So we're -- whether it's our Atlanta
software COE or some of the senior people that I pointed out, we're quickly
building out our capabilities, but at the same time, engaging customers for
revenue generation. And I can tell you that software business was -- in total,
was up double digits in Q1.

HOWARD ALAN RUBEL: No, I understand the challenge of doing
that. I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up in the other area. On HBT, you
called out the profitability was a little bit below what you might have
expected and me as well. And the kind of a two-part question. Is part of it
mix? And can you elaborate on that? And then from a strategic point of view,
we've seen a lot of what I'll call retail struggle a bit and that has, in fact,
been a benefit of the e-commerce world. So can you talk about that structural
dynamic and then also the near-term issue?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. No, I think, Howard, you have it
exactly right. I think the mix has been our biggest issue for Q1 in HBT, both
from a mix from a products versus distribution perspective, but also a
geographic perspective where we saw great, tremendous rate of growth in some of
the HGR regions with regions which tend to be slightly less accretive versus
some of the developed markets. So that was issue #1. Now in terms of the retail
versus transitioning to more e-commerce, I'm not sure that was really one of
the causes. Frankly, our North America business was a little bit softer than we
had expected. But we -- HBT, when I pointed that out earlier when I answered
the question around new product launches, there isn't a business out there that
has more exciting product launches coming up in Q2 and Q3. And I expect that
we're going to have a really, really nice strong second half of the year as
well as a nice recovery here in Q2.

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, the other point I would add, Howard,
is that in some of the businesses that are growing faster than others, for
example, as Darius mentioned, the Americas region, when you have an OEM business
where we're providing parts and components to OEMs, that is growing quite
strongly low to mid-single digits. The margins on the initial sale are not
great, but we're building the installed base. That's the business that we're in
here, so creating aftermarket opportunities (inaudible). I think you're seeing
a little bit of that in the Americas as well.

OPERATOR: And our final question for today comes from
Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.

CHRISTOPHER D. GLYNN, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER
& CO. INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Noticed your comments on the several large
smart meter project rollouts. Just wondering how much of that has developed
since December, and some complexion on how those came to fruition and [should
roll ].

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, I mean, some of -- yes, some of them
certainly are -- we secured those since December. Overall, we're very bullish
on the smart energy business for really the rest of the year. Those revenues
tend to be maybe more lumpy than one expect. We were kind of flattish in the
first quarter, but expect double-digit growth in the second quarter and high
single-digit growth for the year. So we've been very successful in securing
some of those larger wins. We're really pleased with what we saw in terms of
win activity in Q1. So overall, very bullish on the Elster acquisition and what
we're seeing in our smart energy business.

CHRISTOPHER D. GLYNN: And then the follow-up. Just long-term
pension income, kind of curious if you could update the thoughts there. It's
certainly a little bit arcane. If you could -- it's a nice income right now.
What's kind of the long-term characteristic and sense of variability on how
that P&L impact can swing over time?

THOMAS A. SZLOSEK: Yes, I mean, as you know, I mean, I like
to simplify the model into 2 pieces: One is the assets, and the other is
liabilities. The assets, you used the word archaic accounting model. I mean, we
just apply an assumed return to the assets, and that goes into our income. So
as long as that assets pool that we have is performing, and it has performed
fairly well, you keep applying that same rate of income and you tend to grow
your pension income. On the liabilities side, it's interest rate related. So
we're in a low-interest-rate environment, and we apply that interest rate to
the liabilities, and that goes into our expense as well, that's a component of
our expense. As that interest rate rises, you would see a decline in the
pension income, but it's -- it overall is flat. The important part for us is
that the plans are in very good shape. They're well-funded. We're in the
mid-90s or higher in most of our plans, including the big one in the U.S. We
don't foresee any contributions in the foreseeable future. So it just becomes
kind of a bookkeeping thing for us as we go forward here.

OPERATOR: That concludes today's question-and-answer
session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius
Adamczyk for any additional or closing remarks.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Thank you. I'm pleased with our performance
in the first quarter, especially our sales performance and overall execution.
It was a clean quarter all around with every business either meeting or
exceeding the top line guidance we provided. However, there's more work to do.
Everyone in the organization is focused on our key priorities: improving
organic growth, maintaining our productivity rigor and becoming a best-in-class
software industrial company. We're going to continue to stay focused on
outperforming for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. And I look
forward to sharing our continued success with you on future calls. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. That does conclude today's
teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful
day.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the
Honeywell's fourth-quarter earnings conference call.

(Operator Instructions)

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would
now like to introduce to your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice
President of Investor Relations.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC: Thank
you, Shavonne. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's fourth-quarter 2016
earnings conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, David Cote;
President and Chief Operating Officer, Darius Adamczyk; and Senior Vice
President and CFO, Thomas Szlosek. This call and webcast, including any
non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at 

.

As a reminder, elements of this presentation contain
forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world, and of
our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we ask that
you interpret them in that light. We identify the principle risks and
uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC
filings.

This morning, we'll review our financial results for the
fourth quarter and full-year 2016, and share our guidance for the first quarter
of 2017. As always, we'll leave ample time for your questions at the end. So
with that, I'll turn the call over to David Cote.

DAVID COTE, CHAIRMAN & CEO, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC:
Good morning, everyone. Well, we finished 2016 with a strong fourth quarter,
delivering earnings per share of $1.74, and that's up 14% year-over-year. The
quality of earnings was strong driven by double-digit growth in our UOP and
Solstice portfolios within performance materials and technologies, as well as
continued strength in transportation systems and the home and building
technologies distribution business. We also funded more than $30 million in new
restructuring projects, and absorbed more than $115 million in aerospace OEM
incentives.

We finished the year by exceeding the segment margin and
free cash flow estimates that we provided you in December. Segment margins for
the fourth quarter expanded by 90 basis points excluding M&A, mostly due to
productivity and benefits from the significant restructuring actions we
executed throughout the year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion with
126% conversion driven by improved working capital. For the full year, earnings
of $6.60 increased 8% year-over-year. Operationally, our segment margins
improved by 80 basis points for the year.

In 2016, we also completed several significant portfolio actions
that will deliver attractive future returns for our share owners. The spin-off
of our resins and chemicals business not only reduced the cyclicality and
improved the margin profile of our performance materials and technologies
businesses, but it also created nearly $800 million in shareowner value. And at
today's AdvanSix stock price, that value is $1.1 [billion]. We sold our
aerospace government services business and reinvested $175 million of the
proceeds into earnings enhancing restructuring projects. We split the former
automation and control solutions business into two new, more nimble reporting
segments that will deliver better growth, speed and productivity.

In 2016, we also funded more than $250 million in
restructuring projects that will provide a significant tailwind this year and
beyond. We also deployed more than $2 billion for share repurchases, funded
high return capital projects through $1.1 billion of CapEx, and refinanced our
debt, reducing our expected 2017 interest expense by about 8%, while increasing
our aggregate borrowings by $4 billion.

Lastly, we successfully implemented a comprehensive CEO and
segment leadership succession plan. Darius has hit the ground running, and has
worked extensively with our businesses on their 2017 operations and strategic
plans. As Darius and Tom shared during our outlook call in December, we remain
optimistic about 2017, and we're reaffirming our 2017 guidance of 6% to 10%
earnings growth ex-divestitures, and organic sales growth of 1% to 3%. For the first
quarter, we are initiating EPS guidance of $1.60 to $1.64, which is a 6% to 9%
increase year-over-year ex-divestitures.

I would like to share some of our recent highlights on this
next slide, which includes some great wins and progress in our connected
initiatives. Our long cycle backlog is improving in a number of our businesses
including a double-digit improvement in building solutions driven by projects
growth, a mid single-digit increase in defense and space driven by US defense,
and a mid single-digit improvement in UOP driven by increased equipment demand.
We're seeing continued strength in Intelligrated with backlog up more than 40%,
and in transportation systems where our win rate for 2016 was more than 50%.
Also, the pipeline of orders for Solstice remains above $3 billion.

Significant wins in the fourth quarter include a large
utility energy service contract to modernize the Tinker Air Force Base in
Oklahoma City. The upgraded water and HVAC systems, energy efficient lighting,
and other advances will significantly reduce their carbon fingerprint, while
saving the Air Force more than $3.5 million a year. UOP booked two additional
licensing agreements in China.

We licensed our Unicracking technology for the production of
diesel and naphtha to meet growing Chinese demand for transportation fuels. And
we licensed our methanol-to-olefins technology which enables the conversion of
domestic coal resources to ethylene and propylene, the essential ingredients
for making plastic. This is UOP's ninth MTO license in China. UOP continues to
win in China because of our local expertise, local manufacturing capabilities,
and our 80 year history of helping the Chinese petroleum industry solve its
toughest challenges.

Also in UOP, we announced that our Modular XCeed bioreactor
technology is helping a fresh-cut fruit and vegetables company in the US to
treat wastewater. The unit treats roughly 150,000 gallons a day to meet local
standards. Wastewater regulations are getting increasingly strict, and we have
unique technology to help our customers meet these requirements more
efficiently and cost effectively, with simple modular equipment for fast
installation and low maintenance. This is our first XCeed facility for the food
and beverage industry, and growth in segments outside of oil and gas will help
reduce the cyclicality of UOP in the future.

In home and building technologies, we finalized a $250
million advanced meter project with Entergy to help improve electricity service
and reliability for utility customers across Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi
and Texas. And our HBT business continues to make advances in high growth
regions, providing connected security solutions like a new municipal
surveillance system, and our new line of INNCOM Elements Guestroom Controls for
hospitality customers.

We're also making significant progress on our connected
initiatives which are powered by the Honeywell Sentience platform. Within
connected aircraft, our equipment is available for use on all Airbus platforms,
and system integrations are in process on the Boeing 737 MAX, 787 and 777X. In
the business jet market, Bombardier and Gulfstream will be offering JetWave on
selected models of new aircraft, and we are certifying the system for
aftermarket upgrades on over 30 models. We are nearing a milestone of 500
JetWave deliveries, and we continue to receive significant orders. It will be a
big part of our growth story in 2017 and beyond.

We have JetWave on our plane, and it is awesome. While I was
live-streaming a TV show on my ipad, I got a phone call on my iPad, answered
it, had no noticeable latency, completed the call, and returned to the show. It
is awesome, really simply awesome.

For connected homes, we made some exciting announcements at
this year's Consumer Electronics Show. We introduced new Lyric do-it-yourself
security cameras which let homeowners monitor motion and sound while away from
their homes. We announced the compatibility of the Lyric Home Security and
Control System with Apple HomeKit, giving homeowners control of their security
system through Siri or the Apple Home app. The ever-expanding suite of
Lyric-connected products now includes cameras, a water leak and freeze
detector, thermostats, and security products to keep homes safe and
comfortable.

Within connected plant, we announced new INspire
partnerships in Honeywell process solutions with Dover Automation and Aereon
that will help manufacturers leverage the Industrial Internet of Things to
improve the safety, efficiency and reliability of operations across a single
plant, or several plants across an enterprise. We currently have four partners
as part of the INspire program, which fosters collaboration between customers,
equipment vendors, process licensors, consultants and Honeywell experts, and we
expect that number to grow considerably throughout the year.

We also continued to gain traction for our family of
cloud-based services for the oil and gas industry that anticipates operational
complications, offering real-time solutions to overcome them. In the last few
months, we've announced agreements to help PetroVietnam produce more gasoline
and consume less energy, and to help Delek Refining avoid downtime and improve
its operations. Lastly, a few weeks ago, we announced a collaboration with
Intel to develop IoT solutions for the retail industry. Honeywell and Intel
will jointly develop solutions that utilize the two company's technology
offerings including our sensors, hand-held computers, processors, bar code
scanners, RF ID tags and readers, and cloud-based software. These solutions
will help retailers and supply chain firms gain greater visibility into
in-store inventory, enhance customer service, and ensure items ordered online
are available for in-store pickup.

A number of these technologies will be on display at our
annual investor conference which will take place on March 1, at The Plaza in
New York City. Darius and I look forward to talking with you more about our
progress then. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.

TOM SZLOSEK, SVP & CFO, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC:
Thanks, Dave. I'm on slide 4. Earnings per share of $1.74 for the quarter
increased 14% from 2015 as Dave indicated. Now this excludes the charges for
debt refinancing and pension mark-to-market we talked about in our guidance,
and also from 2015, it excludes the divestitures that we did in 2016.

To reemphasize Dave's point, the double-digit increase was
achieved even while absorbing the impact of $48 million in incremental
year-over-year OEM incentives. The fourth-quarter reported earnings per share
were $1.34. The lower amount reflects that $0.12 for that debt refinancing, as
well as the pension mark-to-market of approximately $0.28 a share, driven by
lower discount rates in UK, Germany and the US. The 2015 pension mark-to-market
charge was about $0.05 a share.

Segment profit for the quarter was $1.9 billion, and we
expanded segment margin by 20 basis points to 19%. Now that's 90 basis points
at 19.7% excluding the first year dilutive impacts from M&A. Productivity
and restructuring benefits along with higher catalyst and Solstice volumes were
the key drivers of our margin expansion, partially offset by the higher
aerospace OEM incentives I just mentioned. Sales of $10 billion were flat on a
reported basis, and declined by 1% on core organic basis.

In PMT, we delivered double-digit core organic sales growth
in UOP and in Solstice. In addition, our transportation systems and home and
buildings distribution businesses continued to grow nicely. However, we did see
declines in defense and space and business and general aviation similar to what
others are seeing, and we had unanticipated supply chain delays within our
safety and productivity solutions business at the end of December, which
modestly diluted our performance in SPS.

Free cash flow in the quarter of $1.7 billion, up 8% with
conversion of 126%, largely driven by improvement in working capital. Our CapEx
reinvestment ratio for the quarter exceeded 190% as we continue to invest in
high ROI projects. This is the third consecutive year of reinvesting at over
150% of depreciation, but we expect the reinvestment rate to normalize to
around 1 times the depreciation, as we complete this investment cycle. CapEx is
expected to decrease by about 5% in 2017. Overall, the fourth quarter was a
very nice finish to the year.

I'm now on slide 5 to discuss the segment performance.
Starting with aerospace, our core organic sales came in at the high end of our
December outlook with softness in business and general aviation, and prior year
program completions at international, defense and space leading to an overall
5% decline. Turbo continued to be a great story driven by our penetration in
light vehicle gas applications.

For the year core organic sales in our gas business were up
more than 20% and over 30% in the fourth quarter, and we booked more than $5
billion in new platform wins bringing our 2016 win rate for all of [TS] north
of 50% as Dave indicated. Our aerospace segment margin came in above our
forecast, driven by stronger productivity, and slightly lower OEM incentives
that we anticipated, but still higher year-over-year.

Home and building technology delivered 2% core organic
growth led by building solutions, global distribution and our high growth
regions, where we grew more than 10% in both China and in India. Growth in our
smart energy business improved, driven by smart meter program rollouts in
Europe.

HBT margins excluding the first year dilutive impact of
M&A expanded by 60 basis points, driven by benefits from previously funded
restructuring and commercial excellence. Now this was partially offset by the
impact of higher distribution sales in the mix. In PMT, core organic sales grew
by 5%. UOP was very strong, growing 10% in the fourth quarter driven by
catalyst, licensing and equipment. Process solutions finished the year with
strong sales on software and migration services.

Now the positive sentiment in our oil and gas businesses
continues, and we see signs of improving activity with our customers around the
world, including a 5% increase in the UOP backlog driven by equipment,
engineering and services. And fourth-quarter orders growth in HPS of 8%, driven
primarily by global mega projects and the industrial thermal business. Finally,
Solstice low-global-warming refrigerant volumes in flourine products drove 8%
core organic sales growth in advanced materials, and we expect this trend to
continue in 2017.

PMT margin expanded by more than 500 basis points driven by
those strong volumes, productivity and higher catalyst and licensing volumes in
the mix. In SPS, we ended the quarter slightly below expectations as I
mentioned earlier. Intelligrated continues to perform quite well. Its order
rates have been strong, increasing by double-digits in calendar year 2016, and
the business is exceeding its income targets despite the acquisition and
integration costs we've incurred. SPS segment margin expanded 100 basis points
excluding the first year dilutive impact of M&A. This was driven by
benefits from restructuring and commercial excellence.

Slide 6 shows the elements that contributed to our EPS
growth in the quarter. This was a quarter of strong earnings growth driven
principally by the performance in our business segments. Starting on the left,
earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $1.53 if you exclude last
year's pension mark-to-market charge, and the fourth-quarter [2000] earnings
associated with the 2016 divestitures.

Operational segment profit reflects our core business
performance, so excludes non-operational impacts such as one-time M&A costs,
the dilutive impacts from the strengthening US dollar, and incremental OEM
incentive. Operational segment profit was the big driver, contributing $0.19 to
earnings. Our continued productivity across the portfolio, the increased
volumes most notably from UOP and Solstice, the operating earnings from the
nine acquisitions we've completed since 2015, and the benefits from
restructuring we continue to fund, are all fueling the operational improvement.

All other is a $0.02 tailwind, and includes benefits from
below the line items, a slightly lower share count and a lower tax rate,
partially offset by the non-operational components of segment profit I
mentioned. This works to earnings of $1.74 per share, a 14% increase, our
strongest quarter of 2016.

Let's turn to slide 7 to quickly recap our full-year
performance. Our full-year sales increased 2% on a reported basis. For the
year, we had good growth in home and building distribution, global gas
platforms within transportation systems, the commercial aviation aftermarket in
aerospace, and in our Solstice business in performance materials and
technologies. You can see a summary of our segment performance on the right of
the slide, and more details about our segment's fourth-quarter and full-year
sales performance are in the appendix.

Segment margins expanded by 10 basis points, excluding the
dilutive first-year impact of M&A driven by productivity and restructuring
benefits, partially offset by higher aerospace OEM incentives and the impact of
foreign exchange. Now the incremental year-over-year aerospace OEM incentives
diluted our segment margin by 50 basis points in 2016. As you'll recall, this
turns into a slight tailwind in 2017. The result of all this were earnings of
$6.60, up 8% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $4.4 billion was slightly better
than we previewed in December, driven by better working capital performance.

So with 2016 now behind us, let's take a quick look at some
market trends we're seeing as we head into 2017. I'm on slide 8. In our oil and
gas businesses, the positive trends we started to see at the end of the third
quarter continue to evolve. UOP orders were up more than 30% from the first
half to the second half, and all of our UOP businesses contributed to a strong
book-to-bill ratio of 1.04 in 2016.

UOP project activity is improving, and a number of projects
that were on hold, particularly in China are restarting. We see good momentum
in our high growth regions, driven by the demand for refined product in China,
and India's accelerated transition to the Euro VI emissions standards.
Domestically, our modular gas processing orders picked up in 2016, and we
expect that to continue in 2017. The activity in our international gas
processing business continues to be slow, although the pipeline is encouraging.

We see similar encouraging trends in process solutions.
While the pipeline of new mega projects continues to be lumpy, there have
recently been expansions of previous awards, and start-ups of awards that were
on hold from prior years. The activity in our short cycle and software
businesses, so in advanced solutions, life cycle solutions, and service
businesses should continue to improve as our customers resume spend in small
and mid-sized projects. And on a regional basis, activity in the US, China and
Russia remains positive.

We're also starting to see signs of improvement in our
defense and space portfolio, including 7% growth in our backlog, and increased
activity in our US core defense business. However, there is continued softness,
albeit moderating in our commercial helicopters and domestic space businesses,
consistent with what others are experiencing. Our plan continues to assume that
the US DoD Continuing Resolution is in place through April. For the year, we
expect defense and space to be roughly flat on a core organic basis versus
2016.

Regarding construction, while commentators have been
expecting a slow down in growth rates since 2017, recent indicators have been
more positive. The US Dodge Momentum Index has risen for three consecutive
months, reaching a new high in December, with a surge in commercial planning
intentions. Nevertheless, we continue to plan conservatively in this space, and
continue to forecast low single-digit growth in residential and commercial
construction leading to low to mid single-digit growth in HBT.

In aerospace, we expect the weakness in the business jet
market will persist over 2017. This is most prominent on the OEM side, and our
outlook here has not changed. In the aftermarket, the number of engine maintenance
events is down. This will drive variation in growth quarter-to-quarter, but for
the full-year we expect aftermarket revenue to be in line with flight hours, as
our accelerated growth in connectivity solutions and repairs, modifications and
upgrades provides offsetting momentum.

Regarding currency, as you know most of our exposure in the
Euro is hedged at $1.15, and we have selectively hedged other currencies as
well. Thanks to this hedging approach, there's no change to our EPS outlook,
despite the stronger US dollar compared to the assumptions we had in our
outlook call. Currency headwinds, however, will bring down our full-year
reported sales outlook by about 1.5%, and our revised guidance is now $38.6
billon to $39.5 billion in 2017 sales. The reduction is solely due to the
foreign exchange I just mentioned. So on an overall basis, the markets we serve
are largely unchanged from what we said in December, but we'll continue to
monitor this as we move through the first quarter.

Let me move to slide 9, with a preview of Q1. For total
Honeywell, we're expecting first-quarter earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.64.
That's up 6% to 9% year-over-year, excluding from 2016 the earnings associated
with our 2016 divestitures, which was about $0.05 in the first quarter.

Sales are expected to be between $9.2 billion and $9.4
billion, which is flat to up 2% on an organic basis, or down 2% to 4% reported.
The difference between the reported and core organic sales is due to the
divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by the impact
of acquisitions primarily Intelligrated. Segment margins are expected to expand
by 50 to 80 basis points.

We expect that the sales in the second half of 2017 will be
stronger than the first half. PMT and HBT will have a steady quarterly
progression as they have in recent years. The differences between first and
second half are more pronounced in aerospace and safety and productivity
solutions, but we have good visibility to the acceleration.

For example, in aerospace in the first half of the year, we
expect higher year-over-year OEM incentives which as you know impacts the top
line, but we expect that trend to reverse in the second half. The decrease will
drive a 1% incremental growth for aerospace in the second half of the year. In
addition, we anticipate aerospace aftermarket will be stronger in the second
half due to increased sales, repairs, modifications and upgrades including
further growth of connected aircraft offerings.

In transportation systems, we also have second half growth
acceleration. This is driven by scheduled new launches, and the lapping of a
large program completion that will negatively impact sales in the first three
quarters of 2017. In safety and productivity solutions, our second half is expected
to be stronger as Intelligrated reaches the one-year point in our portfolio in
September, and its growth is then included as organic.

In the safety business, we expect positive impacts of a
stronger oil and gas industry, and are already beginning to see small signs of
improvement including increased bookings in gas detection and personal
protection equipment, and increasing activity from distribution partners in the
Gulf. Lastly, we have significant new products launching in the productivity
business in the spring, including mobile printers and computers.

For the full year, our guidance assumes a tax rate of
approximately 25%, which is slightly higher than the full year 2016. The tax
rate is based on an assumed level of employee stock option exercises, and any
change in that exercise rate could impact the tax rate. We'll update you on
that as we progress through the quarter. Our first quarter guide assumes a
weighted average share count of approximately 772 million shares.

In aerospace, first-quarter sales are expected to be down on
a reported basis, primarily due to the divestiture of the aerospace government
services business. The strong deliveries to our air transport OE customers for
newer platforms are expected to continue, driven by the 737, A320 and A350, but
will be offset by declines in legacy platforms as we previewed in December.
Additionally, sales in business and general aviation will be down, and
aftermarket sales are expected to be slightly up. Defense and space will also
be slightly up, driven by growth in our US core defense business, partially
offset by declines in international defense, US space and commercial helos.

Finally in turbo, the strong growth we experienced in 2016
will continue, building on continued platform wins in gas and diesel. Light
vehicle gas will continue to be the main driver, while we expect a slight
improvement in commercial vehicles following a strong fourth quarter there.
Aerospace margins are expected to expand by 40 to 70 basis points, driven
primarily by productivity, repositioning benefits, and the effects of our
foreign exchange hedging strategy, partially offset by the unfavorable mix of
new versus legacy platform deliveries.

HBT sales are expected to be up 1% to 3% driven by new
product introductions including the Lyric launches that Dave highlighted, as
well as Elster smart meter programs, and another quarter of double-digit growth
in China, primarily driven by our air and water business. Our [hydro-treating]
strategy and One China organization continue to serve us very well in this
regard. In distribution, we expect to see continued conversion of backlog in
the energy business of building solutions, and strength in global distribution
which continues to outgrow its markets and peers.

We anticipate that HBT margins will expand by 130 to 160
basis points driven by improving volumes in the products business, commercial
excellence, and the benefits from our 2016 restructuring action. In PMT, sales
are expected to be up 3% to 5% on an organic basis, or down 10% to 12% on a
reported basis, due to the spin-off from the resins and chemical businesses. We
expect strong orders and sales growth throughout the PMT portfolio as I
mentioned earlier. The segment margin expansion will be driven by productivity
and the impact of the spin-off. PMT continues to execute very well on their
productivity initiatives.

In safety and productivity solutions, we expect that organic
sales will be down 1% to up 1%, or up 19% to 21% on a reported basis including
the Intelligrated acquisition. The safety business is expected to be up
slightly in the first quarter, driven by new product introductions in both the
industrial safety and retail footwear businesses, improving orders in the
industrial vertical overall, and improvement in our supply chain. The
productivity business is expected to be flat to slightly down, driven by
continued retail market softness that is impacting demand for scanners and
mobile computers.

That being said, we are seeing significant orders growth in
our supply chain-related business, particularly in our voice-enabled connected
workers solutions, and we expect to clear the supply chain challenges we faced
in the fourth quarter. In addition, double-digit growth in Intelligrated is
expected to continue. We are confident that our in investments in connected
retail solutions, coupled with Intelligrated warehouse automation solutions are
positioning the business for long-term growth. SPS segment margins are expected
to be up more than 150 basis points excluding the first year of dilutive
impacts of M&A, driven primarily by the impact of productivity and
restructuring benefits.

Let me move to slide 10, where we're reaffirming our
earnings and organic sales guidance, and have updated the year-over-year
figures to reflect the 2016 actual results. From a total Honeywell perspective,
we expect sales in the range of $38.6 billion to $39.5 billion, up 1% to 3% on
a core organic basis. Reported sales growth will be lower in the range of flat
to down 2%, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange and the
divestitures we completed in 2016. As I indicated earlier, the difference in
2017 sales from our outlook call is solely related to our FX assumptions.

Segment margins are expected to be 19% to 19.4%, or up 70 to
110 basis points versus 2016. Earnings per share expected to be between $6.85
and $7.10, or 6% to 10% growth versus 2016. The quarterly linearity for EPS
remains roughly in line with prior years. Free cash flow forecast remains in
the range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion. That's up 5% to 7% from 2016.

On the right side of the page, we've updated our segment
guidance to reflect the impact of final 2016 results on the variances, and
updated foreign currency impacts in each business on the sales line. Otherwise,
there are no changes to the outlook from December. As I said earlier, our tax
rate may be more volatile quarter-to-quarter, depending on the number of
employee stock options that are exercised. Our guidance assumes an approximate
25% tax rate at present, slightly higher than last year.

Let's turn to slide 11. To sum up, we finished 2016
strongly, 14% earnings growth, 8% free cash flow growth in the fourth quarter,
and 8% earnings growth for the full year. We've reaffirmed our 2017 outlook,
and expect first quarter EPS to be up 6% to 9% excluding divestitures. We've
put together a credible 2017 plan under Darius' leadership that continues to
deliver significant value to our shareowners, our customers and our employees.
With that Mark, let's turn it over to Q&A.

MARK MACALUSO: Thanks, Tom. Dave, Darius, and Tom are here
to answer your questions. So Shavonne, if you could, let's open up the line to
Q&A?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: Thank you, we will take our first question from
Scott Davis from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.

SCOTT DAVIS, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Hi, good morning,
guys.

DAVID COTE: Hey, Scott.

SCOTT DAVIS: Dave, is this your last conference call?

DAVID COTE: It is. This is the last one, and I can promise
you I'm really going to miss it. (laughter) It wasn't a joke, I was serious.

SCOTT DAVIS: It's good for everybody, right? (laughter)
Well, you will be missed, but I'm sure Darius will do a great job.

DAVID COTE: I am confident.

SCOTT DAVIS: Well, we know where you live, if he doesn't do
a good job, let's put it that way so.

DAVID COTE: Well, you do now.

SCOTT DAVIS: Yes. So look, I have a nit-picky question, this
JetWave thing, is this -- sounds interesting for sure, and you've talked about
it for the last couple of years, it's not brand new. But this -- is this more
of a just new platforms, or can you do a rip and replace, and get rid of some
of the existing slow WiFi that's out there with [GoGo]?

DAVID COTE: You can absolutely retrofit, and that's one of
the comments that I had made because we're in that process. And I think as
consumers start to see what's possible when you're using this JetWave service,
they're going to be demanding it. I mean, it really is stellar. I was on the
plane, I wanted to test all this stuff myself, my guy -- been giving all the
guys a hard time about going faster.

So I started live-streaming a show. It worked perfectly. I
got a phone call through the iPad while I was watching the show, answered the
phone. Almost, in fact, I noticed almost no latency in the call at all. And
then, when I ended the call, the show resumed exactly where I had left off. It
was quite impressive.

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, I'd add, Scott, that we have over a 1,000
aircraft that are committed to JetWave. We've got over 20 airline wins to date.
It's a selectable on the Airbus. We've been certified on the platforms that we
mentioned earlier. We're working with Boeing to get certified as we said, so it
looks pretty good. The growth is very strong double-digits for us in 2017.

SCOTT DAVIS: So what -- how does the profitability on this
stuff work? I mean, are you going to -- I assume this is some sort of monthly
charge, but when do you start making money on something like JetWave? Is it a
couple years of investment, and then it really starts to kick in, or on day
one, are you shipping out units that are profitable?

DAVID COTE: Yes, we make money now.

SCOTT DAVIS: Is that a monthly charge, Dave, or is it -- how
does it work?

DAVID COTE: It's going to vary on some of the -- depending
on the segment. So I don't know if we've shared all that on the business model,
but it will vary between large planes and biz jets.

TOM SZLOSEK: But to be clear, Scott, I mean, there's a
significant amount of equipment that goes along with this, which is sell and
install model for us. So that is also helping the growth, and creates that
profitability for us immediately.

DAVID COTE: This is a good one.

SCOTT DAVIS: Okay. Good. That's why I asked. Good luck,
guys. Thanks.

DAVID COTE: Scott, Scott?

SCOTT DAVIS: Yes.

DAVID COTE: Before you go, I will always remember that you
were our first supporter back in those dark days when I first started here, so
that's not something I'll forget. And I'm, I was obviously pleased that we
could prove you correct for the 15 years, but thank you for that.

SCOTT DAVIS: You're quite welcome. I was pretty -- I got
lucky. That's all. (laughter) But nevertheless, thanks, guys.

DAVID COTE: It was a bold move at the time, and I appreciate
it.

SCOTT DAVIS: Okay. Thank you.

OPERATOR: And we will take our next question from Stephen
Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.

STEPHEN TUSA, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Hey, good morning.

DAVID COTE: Hey, Steve.

STEPHEN TUSA: First of all, congrats to Scott for getting
the call right early. It's been a good one for him, so congratulations to him.
For a first question, what TV show were you watching? (laughter)

DAVID COTE: It was the Americans. I don't know if you've
seen it. I'm only in the first season, so don't tell me anything.

STEPHEN TUSA: I'm glad to see you're still working hard out
there so. (laughter)

DAVID COTE: Got to test the system, you don't want me flying
the plane.

STEPHEN TUSA: I can picture Darius in the same jet, just
doing something different on his iPad. (laughter) So just a question on tax. Can
you maybe just talk about what the dynamics are around how -- if repatriation
comes through, border adjustments, just give us some color on your kind of net
export position? If the Brady Bill does go through, I'm sure you guys have done
some analysis on what -- what should we expect?

DAVID COTE: Yes, we're a net exporter. So on balance, it
would benefit us from a tax standpoint. When it comes to repatriation, it
depends on what the final deal is. If there's a really high tax rate that's put
on it, well, that makes it a lot less interesting. So we'll have to judge it
when we see it.

STEPHEN TUSA: And again, how much -- if it was a very low
rate on repatriation, I mean, would you be able to do something pretty quickly?

DAVID COTE: Sure.

STEPHEN TUSA: Okay.

TOM SZLOSEK: There's going to be some latency between when
something's enacted, and there's some work we have to do on earnings and
profits studies, but it's nothing that's --

DAVID COTE: It won't take years.

TOM SZLOSEK: No, not at all.

STEPHEN TUSA: Right, okay, and then just kind of an annual
run rate on Intelligrated. Just kind of back of the envelope, I'm getting
something for this year kind of close to -- you've given us the first eight
months contribution. I'm getting something close to about $1.1 billion. Is that
around the right number, and what was the annual revenue that it finished at in
2016 for Intelligrated?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, it's a little bit less than that, I mean,
around [$900 million] is what we would call the annual run rate, but it is growing
at that 20% clip. So that you can see that it could get, pretty quickly to the
numbers you mentioned, Steve.

STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. So the [$900 million] is kind of where
it's growing today, versus 2016?

TOM SZLOSEK: I'd say that's an annual run rate, we can work
off of.

STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. And the margin there was relatively low
this quarter, I think it was kind of low single-digits. How do you kind of see
that margin? I know it's not going to be one of your best margin businesses
here in the near-term, but when -- what's kind of the trajectory of getting
that to at least a double-digit range? I know it's a growth story, I'm just
curious as to when the contribution really picks up.

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, I mean as you can appreciate, the first
year is always a tough one for M&A, particularly one of that size. So
that's why we've referenced those lower margin rates. But when those first-year
charges go away, as well as when the synergies kick in, we'll be low
double-digit kind of margin rates.

The interesting thing though, is that the install base that
we build, really gives us a platform for other offerings particularly on the
software side. And that's one of the main reasons we bought the business, is to
be in the supply chain and distribution arena from a technology perspective.
That's going to help that margin rate as well.

STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. Great. And then one last quick one. Dave
and Darius at the March investor meeting, I think, Dave, you're still going to
be around for that one. How prominent of a role will Darius play as far as the
presentation, and what should we expect to hear in March from Darius?

DAVID COTE: Well, they made room for my walker, so I should
be just fine. (laughter Darius?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK, PRESIDENT & COO, HONEYWELL
INTERNATIONAL INC: I think, we just kind of laid out in the finalization of
laying out the agenda, but you should expect me to do a majority of the
presentations that Dave normally does. Obviously, Dave will have a role at the
beginning of the conference, but the expectation should be that I'll be leading
most of the presentations that Dave led in the past.

STEPHEN TUSA: Okay. Well, then I'll save the congratulations
and farewells for then. Thanks a lot.

DAVID COTE: Thanks, Steve. (laughter)

OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Steve Winoker
from Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is open.

STEVE WINOKER, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN & CO.: Hey,
thanks, and good morning, all. I'm glad everyone's in such good spirits.

DAVID COTE: I got to tell you Steve, I really enjoyed your
headline this morning. It's always nice to wrap up on a good quarter.

STEVE WINOKER: You're the best, Dave. I can always count on
you. (laughter) Listen, I want to go back to the meetings that we had in
December, when you and Darius talked about -- you used the word animal spirits
a lot, and maybe the best describer of what you were seeing globally with your
customer base. Could you maybe, it's been a month or so since then, month and a
half, how has that changed?

DAVID COTE: I would say, it's changed to become more
positive. I've really been impressed to see the -- that improvement in animal
spirits. Small company CEOs, big company CEOs, small banks that I've talked to,
really quite surprising, so the animal spirits are real. There's no doubt about
it. And hopefully, if we can just get a few sparks here with some actual
actions, it could be enough to really start to turn the herd.

I don't think it takes us to crazy levels of GDP growth, and
if it did, that would be a problem. But I think we are going to see an
improvement here, I'm not ready to bet on it. We're going to continue to plan
for a slow growth global economy, but it still feels more positive than it has
in a while, coming off of well, the worst recession since the Great Depression.

STEVE WINOKER: Okay.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Just to maybe add one other comment to
that, I'd certainly would agree with Dave's commentary with regards to what
we're seeing. Maybe the one offset to that, and I think a clarity, sooner
rather than later would be particularly helpful, would be on a lot of our
discussions. And that's really what they are at the moment, our discussions
around some trade policies as they relate to both Mexico, China, and some of
the other trade partners that we have. So I think that in our view, the sooner
that gets cleared up and resolved, I actually think there could be a further
uptick.

STEVE WINOKER: Great. You guys talked in your main comments
about, your prepared comments about safety and productivity, and some of the
issues there. But a little more color would be helpful on the supply chain,
especially in terms of these things -- those issues are reversing. You expect
this thing to get back to, back to normal, or some sense of timing around that,
a little bit more color would be helpful there?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, sure. It really goes around some of
the issues are primarily around some of our voice and product lines,
essentially was due to a supplier issue, due to a transition. We do expect
those issues to be cleared up in Q1, and right now we're seeing a recovery plan
that's in place, so it did impact us. Think about an impact in the tens of
millions of dollars, not the hundreds. But nevertheless, it had a meaningful
impact for our Q4, and we expect a full recovery in Q1.

STEVE WINOKER: Okay. And just if I could, Solstice, the big
backlog, how do you see that -- I think you said $3 billion. How do you see
that playing, or how do you see that sequencing out over the next few years?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: We see it obviously accelerating this year,
and continued next year, as particularly with all the European new cars having
Solstice in them, or our competitive offering, and then a further acceleration
in the US. So we continue to see tailwinds for that product as we move forward,
and continue to expect the double-digit growth rate both in 2017, as well as we
head into 2018 and beyond.

STEVE WINOKER: Okay. And sorry, just quickly on Steve's
question, and you said you were net exporter on tax. You guys report $5.5
billion I think on gross exports. So there have been some guesses out there.
Can you just put a finer point on the size of the imports, just to give folks
some idea of the order of magnitude here and the delta?

DAVID COTE: I don't think that's something we report today.
So let's just say it's a goodly amount. I'm not worried.

STEVE WINOKER: Okay. All right, leave it there. Thanks.

OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Jeffrey
Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open.

JEFFREY SPRAGUE, ANALYST, VERTICAL RESEARCH PARTNERS: Thank
you. Good morning everyone.

DAVID COTE: Hey, Jeff.

JEFFREY SPRAGUE: Hey, Dave, feeling a little nostalgic, this
is the last call. We'll see you in March, but good work, congrats.

DAVID COTE: Well, thanks, and I was going to wait until the
end of the end of the call, but you were -- while you took some convincing, you
were also an early supporter, and I'll not forget that either.

JEFFREY SPRAGUE: All right. Well, you put it up, that's
great. By the way, I was guessing you might have been watching Celebrity
Apprentice to try to get a read on who the next president could be, no?
(laughter)

DAVID COTE: I think they already had that argument six or
seven years ago, so I think you still got to be a citizen. I mean, born here.
(laughter)

JEFFREY SPRAGUE: Hey, just a couple of questions. Can you,
and perhaps it's Tom, but just put a finer point on anything we should know on
the timing of [aero] incentives quarterly in 2017? Just to kind of avoid any
confusion or surprises to the extent that you do have visibility on timing?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, the way I characterize it, Jeff, is
overall, it's a modest tailwind for the year, and -- but the first half will be
different than the second half. In the first half, it's actually a headwind, as
we talked about for the first quarter. That does moderate in the second half,
to result in that overall modest impact year-over-year. I'm talking less than
$50 million or so net.

JEFFREY SPRAGUE: Okay. And then, I'm sorry, if I missed it
in kind of the preamble. But also just a finer point on commercial aero
aftermarket if you could, large OE versus business jet, and kind of what -- how
flight hours tracked for you in the quarter?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, I mean, it's -- we expect in 2017 to be on
the aftermarket side, to be largely in line with flight hours, on the air
transport side. And that shows up in both the spares as well as the repair
overhaul businesses. I would say that there is a somewhat of a shift into the
newer platforms that we've talked about, with the extensive build-ups on both
air transport and business jet side, and that changes the install base, the
character of the install base. It freshens it. It has more units under
warranty, so particularly on the business jet side, that can have a timing impact,
while you're still under warranty in some of the new platforms. So we'll also,
on the business jet side hopefully track the flight hours, but you could see
some -- a little bit of softness as a result of that factor I explained.

JEFFREY SPRAGUE: But the actual performance in Q4, Tom?

TOM SZLOSEK: Well, actual performance overall on the
business jet side was low single-digit for both the spares and the RO.

JEFFREY SPRAGUE: And then finally just, I would imagine the
pension funding took a nice repair here at the end of the year. It was in
pretty good shape anyhow, but is pension funding kind of off the table for you
guys in the foreseeable future?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, I would say, that we continue to have
obligations on the international side. We have a number of plants. I mentioned
Germany and the UK are some of the bigger ones, and there is modest
contribution required there, but for the big US plan, it's in pretty good
shape. We see no funding requirements for the foreseeable future.

JEFFREY SPRAGUE: Great. Thank you.

DAVID COTE: Thanks, Jeff.

OPERATOR: And our next question comes from Howard Rubel from
Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.

HOWARD RUBEL, ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC: Well, thank you very
much. Good morning, gentlemen.

DAVID COTE: Howard, how are you doing?

HOWARD RUBEL: I'm all right, Dave. The -- you've always
watched head count, and you've always been conservative in your forecast, and
there's a little bit of have-to in your numbers. How have you gone back to the
business units, and made sure that there's some real confidence in that? I
mean, sometimes you have short cycle businesses, and some there's obviously
backlog, but what have you done to test your managers?

DAVID COTE: Well, I'll turn the bulk of the question over to
Darius, but what do you mean by have-to?

HOWARD RUBEL: Well, the second half of the year is where you
expect a bit more of the performance than in the first half.

DAVID COTE: Oh, okay. Well, aero incentives play into that
as Tom mentioned, and just comparisons.

HOWARD RUBEL: Yes, exactly, and I mean --

DAVID COTE: So it's not that -- it's not like it's a ramp-up
or anything like that you have to -- you've got to have a -- you've got to
believe in. So it's not that big a deal, actually, but Darius spent a lot of
time on the 2017 plan with the businesses, so I'll turn it over to Darius.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes. No, I think our goal is we plan and
invest cautiously. So I think we certainly plan some investments, particularly
in the front-end the business in terms of sales and marketing and R&D. But
we're certainly not going to spend all of that in the first quarter, because
sometimes you can certainly get ahead of yourselves. And we're going to be
monitoring to see if, as the growth coming in, and whether or not we can afford
to make those investments. And they're going to be phased throughout the year
with triggers, that will align with the kind of growth that we're seeing.

So this is not a situation where we're going to kind of
spend the full investment budgets in Q1, and then hoping that things happen.
That's just not the way we operate, and won't now either.

HOWARD RUBEL: No, I understand. But what are you doing in
terms of head count for the year? Are you planning a modest increase, or are
you planning on keeping that relatively stable?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: All in all, given the restructuring
activities that we have planned, we think that those are going to be stable.

TOM SZLOSEK: We are definitely adding on the commercial
side, across the portfolio in aerospace, PMT, and other places we are adding
head count, both in developed regions, as well as high growth regions.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: And then just to add, and I think you're
going to also see a mix change, because particularly in the former ACS
organization but really throughout, we took out a couple of layers of
management to increase organizational speed and decrease bureaucracy, and we
took some of that money that we saved and reinvested it back, particularly in
the sales portions.

HOWARD RUBEL: And then one last question, sort of talking
about expansion in general, and sort of two parts to it. One is you've fixed a
big chunk of your debt going forward. Is the reason you still have the amount
of CP outstanding, you're anticipating some benefit from cash that you can
repatriate? And how are you thinking about deals for the year? I know it's
always -- Dave reminds us every time, it's all about timing and that's not
predictable, but within that context, can you talk about possibly some of the
areas you'd like to enhance?

DAVID COTE: Well, I'll turn it over to Tom. But right now,
CP is cheap, and we're well covered with our credit lines, so it just makes
sense to use it that way, and we do. And you're correct, you foretold the
answer on acquisitions, depends on what becomes available, and is it a price
that we're willing to pay. And Darius is not New Hampshire cheap, but he is
cheap. So he is going to be the -- I don't know what adjective he wants to put
on it, but I'd say, you're not going to see a diminution in the discipline
here.

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, I would echo what Dave said on the debt
that's outstanding. Dave used the word cheap. I would say, CP is actually
profitable, and I'll just kind of leave it at that. (laughter) But we are -- we
do have an extra amount of cash on the balance sheet because of that, and we're
trying to maintain some flexibility to the extent opportunities come up as Dave
said. So it's a good time to be taking advantage of that.

HOWARD RUBEL: Thank you.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: [A caveat]. Yes, the other thing, just to try,
I think just to reinforce what Dave said, I'd certainly going to be cheap,
probably the other word I would use is selective. And really do our -- as we
always have done, real diligence around what does the end market look like,
what are its growth prospects, what's the competitive environment, what's it
going to evolve to? What are the disruptive technologies? We're going to be
spending, we always have and we're going to be spending even more time on those
elements to make sure that these -- our M&A strategy continues to be highly
accurate, highly predictable, and more in line with our financial objectives.

DAVID COTE: And, Howard, I suppose that before you go, I
should add, I'll always have great memories of going to Red Sox games with you.
I'll also remember that you blew me off at a meeting at TRW, and I just wanted
to make sure I publicly stated it. (laughter)

HOWARD RUBEL: Yes, but there was a cheesecake that was made
up in homage for that, if you remember? (laughter)

DAVID COTE: So I'd figured I better be public about it, and
not just private anymore. (laughter)

HOWARD RUBEL: You're very kind. (laughter)

DAVID COTE: See you, Howard.

OPERATOR: And we will take our next question from Joe
Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.

JOE RITCHIE, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thanks, good morning,
guys, and Dave, you will be missed.

DAVID COTE: Thank you.

JOE RITCHIE: I guess, my first question, in listening to
Darius, it was interesting to hear that there's some thought, you know, as
things kind of shake out, that you guys could benefit once policies are set.
Clearly, you're in an export position, but I guess, I'm wondering Dave or
Darius, how concerned are you guys about trade wars? Clearly, China's been a
big growth engine for you. And then also secondly, there's been a lot of tweets
around defense pricing, having to come down. And so what -- how do you guys
feel, your position there as well?

DAVID COTE: From -- to echo what Darius said earlier, yes,
you have to be worried about a trade war. If it gets to that point, it's not
going to be bad just for trade, but it's going to be bad economically. It's
kind of tough to be an economic island now, especially if you're the number one
economy in the world. So it depends on how all that gets handled, and yes, of
course, it's a concern for us.

On the defense side, most of our stuff, you've heard me say
this in the past, but defense is more of a sales channel for us. There's very
little that we do where it's just a single product, solely for defense. It
tends to just be another channel for us. So a lot of our stuff is already just
done on a commercial pricing basis, and I think that kind of mitigates any
potential impact for us.

JOE RITCHIE: Got it. You're -- go ahead, Darius.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, just to add to that, I mean, I think
obviously the -- a lot of the discussion, and I would put it very much in a
form of discussion, and kind of back and forth. It's an obvious concern because
I think any kind of trade dispute, particularly as it relates to Mexico and
China which are our two trading partners would be a detriment, not just to
Honeywell but to the broader economy. But first of all, I remain optimistic,
and I think that this going to get resolved in a manner which is constructive
for all parties involved. And right now, we don't have anything definitive
anyway other than pure speculation. So we do remain optimistic that it will
evolve that way.

TOM SZLOSEK: And Joe, just to add to Dave's point on the
defense side, I mean, many of our positions are not directly with the
government, and we're working with the primes, and we're not a prime. And so,
they're very good at negotiating with us, and we have commercial arrangements
with them as Dave said. And for the platforms that are getting all the attention
recently, I mean, we're very well aware of what's going on.

I mean, we've been on ongoing -- even well before this of,
commitments around costs with primes that we serve as our primary customer. So
don't want to dismiss the concerns, but it's something where we're accustomed
to it. It's an environment that we've operated in for years, and we expect it
to continue.

JOE RITCHIE: Got it. No, that's good to hear. And I guess,
maybe as my follow-on question, it was nice to see the cash flow come through
this quarter, and fully recognize that 2017 appears to be a little bit of a
transition year on the cash flow. Maybe kind of talk us through again, kind of
what's driving the kind of 2 point difference between your cash flow growth and
earnings growth in 2017? And then, what's kind of the framework to think about
2018 and beyond for cash flow?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, I mean, it's been an interesting year for
us, as far as cash has been concerned. I mean, we're -- clearly had some
headwinds in the markets that we serve, and the conversion in the first couple
of quarters was not what we wanted. But in the third and particularly in the
fourth quarter, with a continued focus particularly on working capital, we were
able to get that conversion that you saw, that was north of 100%. Overall, for
the year, 86%, we think that will improve as we head into 2017.

That's going to come from better working capital
performance, and it's not just in our supply chain and inventories, but we have
opportunities in receivables and in payables. So we're working all of those
areas, as well the CapEx that we've talked about, it begins to moderate in
2017. And that moderation accelerates into 2017. So if we go from $1.1 billion,
which is that reinvestment ratio we talked about of over 150%, and we moderate
that down to 110% or 105% or 100% by 2018, that gives us a nice boost as well
to free cash flow. So that should enable the conversion to continue to improve
from 2017 into 2018.

JOE RITCHIE: Okay. Great, thanks Tom. Thanks, guys.

DAVID COTE: See you.

OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Nigel Coe from
Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

NIGEL COE, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks. Good morning,
everyone, and thanks for going along on the call. So Dave, just would love any
thoughts you have on the pick up we saw in December. I mean, we've seen this
pick up across the board. Obviously, the pro business [spiel] we're hearing
from DC is encouraging, but the quickness of the turn up has been surprising.
So I'm just wondering, do you think it's just the absence of uncertainties that
we have regarding the presidential election, Brexit, et cetera, et cetera? Do
you think it's oil and gas, I mean, what do you think has caused all of this
pick up?

DAVID COTE: Well, I do think -- I've said this for several
years, that I don't think economists also really understand what happens after
a severe financial recession. It was true in the 1930s, and it was true of this
one. And a hit to overall confidence was just really strong, really hard. And
when you have the whole herd thinking about slow global growth, and that's just
the way it is, that's just the way it's going to work, well, it becomes
self-reinforcing, because we all act that way.

If you take a look at the conditions for recovery, that's
been pretty good for a while. We've been talking for a number of years about
how good the consumer balance sheets were in the US. You look at capacity
utilization, it's in good shape, unemployment down 4.5% or so. You can argue
underemployment, but still employment's in good shape. Bank balance sheets in
the best condition they've ever been, most company's balance sheets, really
good shape, and I really think it just needed a spark.

And the election, assuming that we -- that the right things
get followed through and we don't end up with some unintended consequences
provides that spark, and I'm really encouraged by what I'm seeing. Now it's got
to turn into something. But right now the feelings are better than I've seen
them in a long time, and that could be enough to get the herd moving in the
direction of saying, I better not miss this moment, as opposed to gee, just
hunker down and keep waiting it out. And that's, not a simple short
explanation, but I think that's probably the case overall.

NIGEL COE: Fair enough. I appreciate the color. And then,
just to turn back to SPS. Obviously, it's been a challenging 2016 as per the
plan. But obviously, we haven't had perfect transparency on this business in
the past, large projects and inventory channel headwinds, and some of the
obviously, the supply initiative you called out. Are these part and parcel of
-- is this the nature of the beast, or was 2016 just a -- sort of a perfect
storm of bad events? I mean, any sense on that you can give us?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, I think this is more, we view 2016 as
much more of an anomaly, than kind of the status quo. I think we have enough --
a confluence of events which were all, kind of came together at the wrong time.
Number one is, obviously we talked about the USPS contract and that conversion.
Number two is, we had that channel inventory issue that had to work its way
through.

Three is, and this was more timing related than anything
else. There was a shorter shortage of larger deals that are notable, because
some of this business goes through distribution, and some of it goes through
direct. And those direct deals were few and far between, not just for us, but
really a lot of our competitors as well. And then four is, I think we
personally, I think we have room for improving some of our channel programs, et
cetera. So we do expect this business to very much return to its performance
that it's enjoyed for many, many years, and use 2016 as an anomaly.

NIGEL COE: Okay. On the channel inventories, are they at a
level now where you are comfortable that sell-in equal sell-out?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, I think most of that has been
resolved, with one exception, but I would say 70% to 80% of the challenge is
behind us.

NIGEL COE: Right. And then just finally for Tom, he called
out in the PR that interest expense, 8% below 2016 level. I mean, obviously I
can do the math, but it implies that interest expense closer to [$300 million]
for 2017, a bit below what we had? That is the right number?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, sounds about right, yes

NIGEL COE: Thanks, Tom.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from
Citi. Please go ahead your line is open.

ANDREW KAPLOWITZ, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Good morning, guys.

DAVID COTE: Hey, Andy.

ANDREW KAPLOWITZ: So some of your business tech customers
have continued to cut production (inaudible). You obviously didn't change your
2017 guidance [aero] So my question is, how much visibility have you had to
these production cuts? And when you think about your overall negative 2% to 1%
organic forecast for 2017 aero, do you have a decent contingency for more
business (inaudible) already in your guidance, and is some stabilization in US
defense or commercial helo is something you were expecting, or maybe could
represent a tailwind to your guidance?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, I mean, I would first start with the
business jet. We, for sure, have the production schedules for the platforms
that we're on, with the large OEMs. We've actually been more conservative, and
we're -- have taken a conservative approach in the second half, when we're
putting together the 2017 plan. So some of the cuts that actually you're
referring to, we most likely had contemplated in the guide that we gave you.

So we're not -- I don't think we're going to be caught off
guard necessarily by what you're now seeing and hearing and reading. On the
commercial helo, that's a space that as you know is heavily dependent on oil
and gas. And for us, the declines over 2016 were just reflective of what was
going on in the market. I think we're going to still see some tepid conditions.
I don't foresee growth for 2017 that you would consider very significant, if at
all. But as the sentiment starts to improve in oil and gas as we articulated in
the prepared comments, we do hope that will turn into some benefits. And you're
already seeing some of the OEM's report on the helo side some modest
improvements. So hopefully, that's a sign of things to come. We haven't built
much of it into our plan, is the way to think about it.

ANDREW KAPLOWITZ: Okay. That's helpful Tom. We know that
you've had more -- you will have more difficult comparisons as the year goes on
in PMT, especially late in the year. But Solstice, you continue to ramp. You
told us what the [UOP] backlog is, it's good, up 5%. (Inaudible) just really remains
steady, I would surmise that UOP should continue to be solid or improve, so why
would sales growth drop from the 3% to 5% you're guiding to in 1Q, as you go
through the rest of the year? Again, is it just you need to be conservative,
it's pretty a short cycle business, is that sort of the way to think about it?

TOM SZLOSEK: I think we'll take it quarter by quarter. We
are seeing as we said, a pretty strong backlog in UOP, and hopefully the orders
that materialize in the quarter will contribute to that further growth. We're
not trying to signal any sudden demise between first quarter, and the rest of
the year for that business.

ANDREW KAPLOWITZ: All right. Thanks, guys.

DAVID COTE: Thanks, Andy.

OPERATOR: We will take our next question from John Inch from
Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.

JOHN INCH, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Thanks, good morning,
everyone.

DAVID COTE: Hey, John.

JOHN INCH: Dave, aren't you glad you left the GE appliances
job? You'd be working for the Chinese otherwise? (laughter)

DAVID COTE: Well, for a variety of reasons, I'm not sorry.
I'd also say, John, you were -- while you took a little longer to convince, you
were also an early supporter, so thank you.

JOHN INCH: You're right. I wasn't that far behind, David.
But you're right, I'm -- it takes me a little longer to kind of get moving in
the morning. Trying to figure out how to top that trade wars question. Maybe I
should ask you what you think of asteroids, but I'll leave that one for Darius.
(laughter)

Hey, safety was down [5%] on the core. And the reason I ask
this, 3M's personal safety business is actually really good, and that company
actually called out some selective pricing actions to try and stimulate some
volume. Are you seeing anything competitively in that dynamic other than just
the market? That's my first question.

TOM SZLOSEK: I don't think so, John. I mean, the -- I would
say, that the growth rate you mentioned, in the low single-digit decline, was
largely the result of the supply chain challenges that we had. I think we would
have been in line with the market otherwise. And as Darius said, January, that
gives us a nice boost for January, and we get those issues behind us.

JOHN INCH: Yes, that's fine. Just big picture, you guys are
obviously not a beta company, which makes you an investable company. But if the
economy continues to percolate, and let's just hypothetically say, your shares
lag, what are your thoughts about really starting to leverage up the balance
sheet and buy your stock, if the market's not willing to comply, at least in
the short run?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, certainly that's been something that we
contemplate, we've talked about our approach, which the foundation is to keep
the share count flat through buybacks, and to opportunistically go after
further buybacks as the market conditions look attractive. In the fourth
quarter, we did about [2 million] shares of buyback, which is more than we --
more than we normally would. And what I would say, is that we're going to
continue on that approach.

I mean we do have a little bit of a restricter in terms of
where our cash is located. You know that most of the cash is overseas, so we
can't just take $9 [billion] of our overseas cash, and put it into buybacks. I
mean, it's just not practical.

Should circumstances change around the new administration
and tax policy and so forth, we'd obviously take a look at it. But right now,
our existing approach is to keep that share count flat, and look for -- just
opportunities for displacement in the market to accelerate where warranted.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, and I think, just overall, John, the
approach would be similar to what it's been for us. We're going to be
opportunistic in terms of those buybacks. And if the tax environment does
change, and the transaction to bring that cash from overseas becomes a bit more
frictionless, we're going to review that. We're going to review it, primarily
two different things.

We're already committed to growing our dividends at a rate
which is faster than EPS. So we've said that. You know about our CapEx profile,
which is going to be elevated this year, and then start tapering off. So that
basically, it comes down to an investment in either buybacks or M&A. And a
lot of that has to do with timing and market conditions and what we see and
what's available. But that's kind of a rough framework as to how to think about
the trade-offs.

JOHN INCH: Yes. No, it makes sense. I mean, Darius,
obviously, there's a lot of perspective that part of your mandate is going to
try and move Honeywell's growth higher, which you probably can't do. You can do
some of it organically, but it's going to require some M&A, and some of
these software deals. You did great on Intelligrate, but some of the stuff is
pretty pricey, especially with the market up. I mean, if you have a bias in the
short run, just given the run, is it -- let's just assume the cash was
frictionless -- you didn't have these repatriation issues, would you be
preferring deals over share repurchase right now, or is it unclear?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: It's really not that clear, because it all
depends on what deals are out there, and what kind of pricing. So it's hard to
say I'm definitely going to prefer one over the other. I think in terms of --
yes, I mean, I certainly hope to enhance our growth rate through some of the
portfolio work that we have been doing, and we'll continue to do. But I will
also -- there's a flip -- the other side of the coin here, which is I think
we've got to continue to maintain our discipline around what we pay. And
granted, some of the higher growth assets usually require higher multiples, but
I think we can -- if we do our homework right, and look real hard, and I think
Intelligrate is a good example of that, I think there's still an opportunity to
buy assets, to buy companies at a attractive pricing.

DAVID COTE: I also think you've got some damn good organic
growth efforts going.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes.

DAVID COTE: I don't quite buy the premise, John --

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes.

DAVID COTE: our organic growth is (multiple speakers)

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Yes, and a lot of the self-help here that
we're doing around our [launch of] commercial excellence, our [VPD] efforts
which we're spending a lot of time as a Company, so I think it is really is a
combination between what I call self-help, and continue to work on our
portfolio like we've done over the last, especially over the last 18 months

JOHN INCH: Yes, makes a ton of sense. We'll see you in
March. Thank you. Appreciate it.

DAVID COTE: See you, John.

OPERATOR: And our next question is from Andrew Obin from
Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is open.

ANDREW OBIN, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Good morning.

DAVID COTE: Hey, Andy.

ANDREW OBIN: So Dave, congratulations, and thank you. And
Darius, I look forward to your hosting the calls going forward. So a question
on top line and margin. It seems that the top line was impacted a little by the
FX, and you have taken up margin relative to December 14. Looking at the index,
looking to Bloomberg currency index, it seems pretty flat from a month ago, so
just wondering, what particular currency is driving it? And the second is, just
looking at higher margin guidance by segment, how much of it is just FX, and is
there any self-help built into this versus a month ago?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, Andy, when you go back to our guidance,
and we're pretty clear on the FX assumptions that we use for 2017, our normal
process is to update the FX rates, at the end of the year. And so, when we do
that, you end up with the impact mostly due to -- if we had used for example,
1.10 as our planning rate for the Euro, we changed that to 1.05, that has an
impact.

The bottom line though, is that the organic growth rates do
not change. We're still calling 1% to 3%. The EPS still stays the same, at that
6% to 10% growth, and the cash conversion remains the same. So it's a matter of
just picking the number and finalizing it, as is our normal process.

ANDREW OBIN: And on the margin question?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, I mean, the change in the change in the
margin is solely due to lower sales and the same segment profit dollars,
because as you know our (multiple speakers) keeps our segment margin protected.

ANDREW OBIN: And then a question on China, they had a big
stimulus last spring. You guys had your trip this summer. You did a very good
job sort of highlighting the fact that there's a lot more growth in China than
the Street was thinking at the same time. We're sort of starting to see it in
the numbers. Given that the Party Congress is in the fall, how much juice do you
think there is in this growth beyond 2017, and how concerned are you guys as to
sort of growth decelerating to the second half of 2017 in China?

DAVID COTE: Well, it's kind of tough to predict exactly
what's going to happen to China economically to your point, especially with
their, I guess, quote, elections coming up. But I'd say overall, we're still
long-term believers in China, so whether they have a lower growth year than
what they've had in the past. At the end of the day, our prospects there are still
extremely good, and you look at all the businesses we're in. Our opportunities
to gain share, to get to tier 3 and 4 cities, still just tremendous. So I don't
see it as having that huge of an impact on our performance.

ANDREW OBIN: And if I can just squeeze one more, just some
color on HPS? You touched on it, but can you provide just a little more color
on region, which are positive, and which are negative?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, I don't have that at my fingertips. It's
probably a good follow-up question for Mark on the call later, or when you talk
to him later.

ANDREW OBIN: Thanks a lot.

DAVID COTE: Thanks, Andy.

OPERATOR: That will conclude today's Q&A session. I
would now like to turn the call back to Mr. David Cote for any additional or
closing remarks.

DAVID COTE: Thanks. After 15 years at the helm, this is my
last earnings call, as some of you have pointed out. It's been an honor to lead
the Honeywell team for this many years, and all of us are proud of what we've
accomplished. But I have to say, we're even more excited about what's coming.
Our outperformance will continue because we've invested heavily in people,
process, and portfolio to do the seed planting that we've always done.

We do well today, not just because of what we are doing
today, but also because of what we did three and five years ago. That
outperformance will continue under Darius. He is just as driven as I am, and
he's smarter. We have many, many terrific years ahead of us. This is an
exciting time to be a part of Honeywell, and you'll all benefit from it.

Now while it is a bittersweet moment or time for me, because
it would be fun to continue running Honeywell in these great years to come,
it's worth a little time to also focus on the sweet side of it. Next weekend,
we will again celebrate that quintessential American holiday, the Super Bowl.
And in that celebration, it's important to remember that we are all Patriots.
Please join me in supporting and celebrating America's team. Thanks.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
Honeywell's third-quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

(Operator Instructions)

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I
would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso,
Vice President of Investor Relations.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC: Good
morning and welcome to Honeywell's third-quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
With me here today are Chairman and CEO Dave Cote, and Senior Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek. This call and webcast, including any
non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at 

.

Note that elements of this presentation contain
forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of
our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we ask that
you interpret them in that light.

We identify the principle risks and uncertainties that
affect our performance on our form 10-K and other SEC filings. This morning we
will review our financial results for the third quarter and share with you our
guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016. And as always, we will
leave time for your questions at the end.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.

DAVE COTE, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC:
Good morning, everyone. As we previewed during our update call two weeks ago
for the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.60, or $1.67,
excluding the $0.07 we deployed to restructuring. We expect to return to
double-digit EPS growth in the fourth quarter, which yields our full-year EPS
growth target of 8% to 9% that we communicated on October 7.

Q3 was a quarter of important changes in many areas that positioned
the Company for better performance next year. These include the split of the
former automation and controls solutions segment, ACS; the acquisition of
Intelligrated; the sale of our government services business, HTSI; and the spin
of resins and chemicals.

Combined with nearly $250 million in restructuring actions,
these changes are lasting improvements to the portfolio that yield benefits
beginning in the fourth quarter and into 2017 when we expect year-over-year
benefits exceeding $175 million from the restructuring actions alone. In the
fourth quarter we'll lap the impact of our US Postal Service project and
productivity solutions, the UOP return to growth, and expect a continued ramp
of our Solstice low global warming product sales.

Darius and Tom will provide more details about 2017 during
our annual outlook call in December, but we have a favorable setup. The fourth
quarter momentum continues, our long cycle businesses are improving, and our
inflections start to kick in.

It remains a slow-growth environment, but we've continued to
invest heavily in the business, in capital projects, research and development,
hiring salespeople, winning content on new aerospace platforms, improving our
growth profile through strategic M&A and divestitures, and executing on
restructuring projects to improve our fixed cost position. With all the work
we've done to improve the growth profile our continued emphasis on the
Honeywell operating system and our performance culture, we are well-positioned
for long-term growth and are committed to creating long-term shareowner value.

On October 7, we communicated all the changes or moving
parts that occurred in the quarter. In our attempt to lend transparency to all
the moving parts, we lost sight of the importance of conveying our confidence
in our future, the fourth quarter, 2017, and beyond. For that miscommunication
I take full responsibility.

Last week we released a number of charts explaining why we
were confident in our future. We've included several of those charts in this
morning's package because we wanted to explain a bit behind each of them. We've
continued to invest heavily, seed planting if you will, and the returns will be
there.

We've outperformed historically and will continue to do so.
We largely discussed third quarter a couple weeks ago, so much of today's
presentation focuses on the future and why we think Honeywell is an exciting
place for you to be.

So with that, I will turn it over to Tom.

TOM SZLOSEK, SVP AND CFO, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC: Good
morning. I'm now on slide 3 with a quick recap of our third-quarter results.

Reported sales of $9.8 billion increased 2%, primarily
reflecting the impact of acquisitions. On a core organic basis sales were down
3%.

Our growth was led by process solutions, transportation
systems, and home and building technologies, but was more than offset by
softness in business jets, defense and space, productivity solutions, and UOP.
The softness in UOP has moderated throughout the year to the extent that in the
fourth quarter we expect high single-digit sales growth in that business.

The decline in segment margins in the quarter reflects the
impact of OEM incentives, M&A integration costs, and the lower volumes
partially offset by benefits from previously funded restructuring. Earnings per
share were up 4% to $1.67, excluding the restructuring charge deployed from the
retroactive portion of the stock compensation accounting change.

The individual restructuring projects in the third quarter
have an average payback of about two years and provide attractive accretion in
both 2017 and 2018. Free cash flow in the quarter was $1.3 billion. That's 103%
conversion on net income.

We continued to put substantial capital to work for our
shareowners, our CapEx and reinvestment ratio was 150% this quarter, and we
bought back approximately $1.9 billion worth of Honeywell shares through the
end of the third quarter. Let me move on to slide 4 to discuss the segment
performance. In aero, the sales decline is consistent with what we previewed.

The negative 6% headline number reflects the softness we
described in our business jet OEM revenues and in defense and space, but also
to a larger degree the increase in OEM incentives. I'll discuss the incentives
more later, but in the third quarter year-over-year increase in OEM incentives
drove 4% of the minus 6% decline in the top-line growth for aerospace.
Excluding the impact of OEM incentives, the commercial aviation OEM business
was down 8%, with the business jet softness being partially offset by steady
growth in air transport.

Our commercial aftermarket business was up 1% on a core
organic basis. We're seeing continued repair and overhaul demand within air
transport, but the softness in the business jet market is impacting the
aftermarket, and we've seen fewer engine repair and overhaul events as a
result. Defense and space was down 6% on a core organic basis, driven by
program completions in US space and international defense and lower volumes for
commercial helicopters, primarily related to oil and gas.

While disappointing, we are encouraged by the double-digit
increase in defense and space year-to-date orders and backlog, although as you
can appreciate much of this activity is longer-term in nature extending into
2017 and beyond. Transportation system sales increased 3% organically in the
quarter, driven by new program launches in light vehicles gas segment where we
saw growth of nearly 20%.

Aerospace segment margins were down, reflecting the increase
in OEM incentives and lower volumes. In home and building technologies, sales
were up 5% on a core organic basis driven by growth in both products and
distribution businesses.

The products business grew 1% organically thanks to more
than 15% growth in China and strength in the Americas environmental and energy
solutions business. The distribution business was up 8% organically in the
quarter, driven by continued strength in the global distribution business and
energy and services contracts within building solutions.

The segment margin rate declines, excluding the impact of
M&A, were primarily due to the mix of products versus distribution revenues
this quarter. In performance materials and technology, sales were down 3% on a
core organic basis driven by UOP, partially offset by strong global megaproject
conversion in process solutions, which was up 3% organically.

UOP sales were down 10% on a core organic basis, driven
primarily by declines in gas processing and licensing and partially offset by
higher catalyst shipments. Notably UOP's backlog was up 15% at the quarter end.
Demand for our catalyst continues to be strong, driven by reloads as a result
of increased refinery turnarounds.

Advanced material sales were down 2% on a core organic basis
as demand for our Solstice line of low global warming materials within fluorine
products continues to be strong, partially offsetting the significant market
pricing headwinds within resins and chemicals. These resins and chemicals
headwinds are obviously now behind us as a result of the AdvanSix spin.

EMT segment margin was up 80 basis points to 21.6% driven by
strong productivity and cost controls, higher catalyst shipments, and the
favorable impact of acquisition integrations. Finally in safety and
productivity solutions sales were down 8% on a core organic basis.

The safety business was down 3%, primarily due to softness
in the general personal protective equipment business and lower demand for
retail products. The productivity solutions business was down 12% on a core
organic basis due to a tough comparison in the third quarter of 2015 and
continued channel headwinds in productivity solutions. We will not face the US
Postal Service headwind next quarter as we've said.

Segment margin was down 90 basis points, excluding M&A,
to 15.2%, primarily reflecting the lower volumes. Slide 5 shows our path to the
fourth-quarter EPS of $1.74 to $1.78. It's very consistent with what we have
previously articulated a couple weeks ago. We expect UOP to grow at high
single-digits on a core organic basis driving significant sequential
quarter-to-quarter EPS improvement.

Catalyst sales are expected to be up about 20% in the
quarter, and licensing and equipment sales will be up about 15%. Additionally
in process solutions, we expect to see the normal fourth-quarter pickup in our
short cycle products and services businesses. We continue to closely monitor
the oil and gas market, but all in all our outlook has improved.

We expect a 2% to 3% improvement from safety and
productivity solutions and $0.03 to $0.04 from restructuring. I spoke earlier
about the rapid paybacks we expect on the restructuring we funded in the third
quarter. All in we have a funded pool of more than $400 million in
restructuring projects.

All other is a $0.05 to $0.06 headwind reflecting the
removal of resins and chemicals and the government services business from the
portfolio, the normal one-time M&A cost from Intelligrated, and an expected
lower number of option exercises resulting in lower income tax benefits. This
works to a Q4 earnings range of $1.74 to $1.78 per share. That's a 10% to 13%
increase from the same period in 2015.

Let's turn to slide 6 to provide some further color on our
fourth-quarter outlook. We expect that sales declines in aerospace will
continue into the fourth quarter, particularly in business jets and defense and
space.

We expect our total commercial OEM business to be down
nearly 20%, with growth in air transport and regional more than offset by
declines in business and general aviation. In our aftermarket business, repair
and overhaul will moderate slightly on lower events and lower aircraft
utilization, while growth in spares should be steady, primarily due to the new
jet wave installations and channel and customer demand.

The backlog in defense and space, as I said, is improving as
we head into fourth quarter, but we still expect the business to be down in the
mid-single digit range on lower volumes globally. And finally, transportation
systems: we see continued global gas turbo penetration offset by slower diesel
penetration, which would drive flat to slightly higher core organic sales in
the quarter.

In HBT we expect organic growth in the low single-digit
range in both the products and distribution businesses. The reported growth is
much higher, reflecting the Elster smart energy business, where we have
significant rollouts in the UK and expected strength in the Americas gas
business.

On the product side, sales in environmental and energy
solutions business will continue to improve driven by new product introductions
in the Americas and strong double-digit growth in China and India. In the
distribution segment, which consists of the global distribution business and
building solutions, we expect strong backlog conversions, specifically in our
energy business and in EMEA and China.

Our global distribution business will grow at a slower rate
due to very tough comps from the fourth quarter of 2015 when this business grew
nearly 12%. Margin expansion will be driven mostly by productivity net of
inflation, the benefits of restructuring, higher volumes, and commercial
excellence offset slightly by the impact of the Elster acquisition.

In PMT we see a return to growth in UOP driven by continued
strong orders. Orders were up 9% in the third quarter, particularly in the
catalyst business. We also see some traction on the equipment side.

Our orders over the past three months were over $700
million, and we're expecting a similar amount in the fourth quarter.
Importantly we see oil prices stabilizing in the $50 range. Generally activity
is picking up across the globe including in China, and some projects that had
been delayed or stalled are now resuming.

Our year-to-date book-to-bill is 1.1 and was closer to 1.3
in the third quarter, and our win rates across all lines of business in UOP are
strong. UOP should grow by high single digits in the fourth quarter as a
result.

In process solutions, sales will be down in the mid-single
digit range on lower megaproject sales growth. However, this should improve in
2017 as we replenish the backlog on anticipated healthy project orders in the
fourth quarter. Finally, in advanced materials core organic sales growth will
be north of 10% driven by Solstice, which will grow considerably this quarter,
and from higher volumes in specialty products across all lines of business.

The significant increase in segment margin will be driven by
the higher catalyst shipment content, volume growth in fluorine products from
Solstice, and the favorable margin impact from the spinoff of AdvanSix. In
safety and productivity solutions we're finally past the headwinds associated
with the US Postal Service deployment, and as a result we expect the business
will be flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter, which represents a nearly
800 basis point improvement sequentially.

This is also supported by a slightly easier setup in
industrial safety driven by prior-year oil- and gas-related declines. We should
see things improve overall from here, especially with the addition of
Intelligrated, which we continue to be very excited about. We've taken aggressive
cost actions to address the slowdown in the third quarter. This should provide
additional runway for margin expansion in the fourth quarter and into 2017.

With more than $1.9 billion in share repurchases this year,
our share count will be approximately 1% lower in the fourth quarter. And
finally as a result of last quarter's adoption of the stock compensation
accounting standard, we now expect that our tax rate will be approximately 25%
in the fourth quarter and about 24.5% for the full year.

Let's turn to slide 7 to discuss our expected full-year
segment margin. On a reported basis we expect to be down approximately 70 basis
points, but this belies the significant operational improvement we expect to
deliver approximately 80 basis points.

We continued to realize volume leverage in our growth
segments and work with our suppliers to drive down material costs.
Additionally, by deploying the Honeywell operating system and our restructuring
capacity, we continued to reduce our fixed costs throughout the enterprise,
including in our plants and our administrative functions.

These are permanent improvements in our cost structure that
will drive significant margin expansion as growth more fully permeates the
portfolio. Offsetting this operational goodness are the upfront effects of
investments we're making to improve the future. You'll recall that we are
completing the first year of our nine recent acquisitions.

This first year is heavily burdened by costs for inventory
accounting, amortization of intangibles, deal costs, and integration costs.
This will be an approximate 50-basis point headwind this year. OEM incentives
are a 60-basis points headwind.

I have a later slide on what these OEM incentives mean for
our future growth, but given the conservative accounting we deploy in this
area, we're experiencing a $0.25 EPS headwind in 2016 that will not repeat.
Finally, the foreign currency movement from 2015, principally the strengthening
of the US dollar, has driven approximately 40 basis points of margin rate headwind.

Based on our hedging positions, we expect this to turn to a
similar size benefit in 2017. So as you can see, we expect to end the year with
segment margin at 18.1%, but are well positioned for 2017, as the favorable
operational impacts from the Honeywell operating system continue and the impact
from the other factors recedes or flips around.

Now on slide 8, we're reaffirming our full-year EPS growth
target of 8% to 9%, or $6.60 to $6.64, excluding the anticipated fourth-quarter
pension mark-to-market adjustment of about $1.5 billion. This is based on
current discount rates and asset return assumptions as of September 30, and is
driven primarily by the decline in interest rates. The sales and segment margin
guidance you see here is consistent with a preview from October 7. With a lower
than anticipated net income, principally in aerospace, we now expect that free
cash flow will be between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion for the full year.

Slide 9 summarizes the end market dynamics that we
anticipate in 2017 versus what we're experiencing this year. First in homes and
buildings we'll continue to see steady growth driven by new product
introductions, connected offerings, and the expansion of our install base. Next
the dynamics we describe for commercial aviation will continue in 2017,
including declines in business jet market, steady performance in air transport
driven by program ramp ups including on the A350 platform, and a reasonably
stable aftermarket.

What will change in commercial aviation is that the massive
2016 headwinds from OEM incentives will become a modest tailwind. We expect the
declines in defense and space will moderate a bit in 2017, but we anticipate
that demand in our commercial helicopter and domestic space businesses will
continue to be slow, will no longer have the impact from our government
services businesses following the sale of HCSI, and in addition our long cycle
backlogs are improving, as I noted earlier.

More than three-quarters of our expected fourth-quarter
sales are firm, which is above where we were at this point heading into the
third quarter. To moderate the effects of the overall declines in aerospace,
we've made significant improvements to our cost structure while investing for
growth, including sales head count, research and development, and in new
products like JetWave.

We anticipate stronger performance in our businesses that
serve the industrial and workers end market. We'll no longer have the US Postal
Service comp, and Intelligrated will contribute to growth. We also expect our
safety sales will improve over the course of the year.

The vehicles market will continue to be strong, with
increasing global penetration of turbos and growth in light vehicle gas
applications. We also expect modest improvements on the commercial vehicle side
in 2017, and on a global basis we expect turbo penetration to be approximately
40%.

Lastly, advanced materials will be a strong contributor,
highlighted by more than 25% growth in our Solstice products. Solstice is
meeting or exceeding all expectations, and is expected to be about a $1 billion
business for us by 2020. Let me turn to slide 10 for a preview of 2017.

We've not finalized our 2017 planning, and as Dave said,
Darius and I will provide a full update in December upon the completion of the
process. We expect a continued slow-growth environment, but also believe that
the inflections we've mentioned are still intact to enable us to grow faster
than the markets we serve.

With that said, we're taking a conservative approach to the
planning framework, specifically relative to business jets, defense and space,
and commercial helicopters. While we're targeting double-digit EPS growth,
we're not counting on a recovery and need specific end markets to achieve that.

We continue to work on the things we can control, and we see
the result of this in the forecasted 45 to 75 basis points improvement in the
margins on low single-digit core organic sales growth. Still, we're constantly
pressed on why we feel confident in our ability to deliver in 2017. Let's spend
a few minutes explaining the rationale underlying our outlook.

Let me move to slide 11. First off, we've continued to
deploy large amounts of shareowner capital. We've increased our dividend 15% in
the each of the last two years, and including the $0.5 billion that value
created through the spinoff of AdvanSix, that's nearly $2.4 billion of
dividends alone in 2016. And we're committed to further growing the dividend
faster than our rate of earnings growth.

On share repurchase we've been very active in 2016, and have
already matched our total repurchases for all of last year. You'll recall that
it takes about $1 billion of repurchases each year to keep our share count
flat, and we've been doing twice that amount. M&A activity has significantly
accelerated over the last 18 months.

For the past few quarters we've been dealing with the
incremental acquisition and amortization costs from these deals, and as that
begins to roll off the contribution from this M&A will really be felt. And
the M&A benefits do not even take into account the sales and commercial
synergies we expect from combining sales forces, leverages Honeywell's
channels, and high growth regions and from general commercial excellence that
we drive in our own businesses. Needless to say we expect M&A will be a
significant value driver in 2017 and for many years to come.

Slide 12 recaps the deals we've completed. Each of these
businesses participates in an attractive fast growing market where they are
perceived as leaders in their space.

They're accretive to Honeywell's growth rates. We believe
there's a big opportunity for us to expand a number of these businesses into
high growth regions given the Honeywell presence, leadership teams, and
infrastructure already in place. Many of these businesses also have a strong
technology and software component, and that will drive superior growth and
improving gross and segment margins. I also don't want to lose the point that
we continue to find strong new talent through our acquisitions that makes the
combined companies better and further drives our software and technology
initiatives.

Let me turn to slide 13. We've talked extensively about OEM
incentives. What you need to remember is one, they're investments that have
gotten us on a number of attractive new business jets and air transport
platforms that build upon our already strong installed base. Two, we expense
these incentives to our P&L as they're incurred, a more conservative
treatment than most of our peers. Three, there's a very clear visibility to the
incentives.

They're negotiated years in advance and any accelerated
recognition of the cost does not change the aggregate cost, only the timing of
the recognition as you saw in the third quarter. And lastly, 2016 is our peak
for these investments. They're still significant, but they begin to decline in
2017 as you can see on the chart. We're excited about the extensions to our
aerospace franchise that these investments are enabling.

You can see on slide 14 some of the other investments that
we've made to grow our business. We've talked extensively over the past few
years about our capital expenditures. We have been investing in about 1.6 times
depreciation for the last several years. The returns on the incremental
investments like Solstice are phenomenal: twice that of any M&A deal we
could do.

And while they do temporarily dilute free cash flow, the
investments are essential to our growth. We're nearing completion of this
investment cycle after which we expect the reinvestment rate to normalize to
between 1.0 and 1.2 times depreciation. We also continue to invest in research
and development at a rate that's approximately 7.5% of sales, including R&D
that's customer funded.

Our R&D is fueling the next generation of Honeywell
products, including our software offerings. And to ensure we have enough feet
on the street to win in our end markets, we're also investing heavily in our
sales force. You may think of this as a short-term investment, but it's not.

A salesperson really isn't productive enough in his first
year on the job, so we have to ensure we have enough sales employees in place
today to support tomorrow's business. The same applies in our high growth
regions, where our head count has grown nearly 14% in the last three years, and
we appointed more than $260 million to restructuring so far this year.

Slide 15 has more detail about capital investments in
performance materials and technologies. These projects add capacity to our
highly profitable businesses like Solstice within flooring products and
catalyst within UOP. They deliver returns in the 30% to 40% range, and we
expect more than $1 billion in Solstice revenues per year by 2020.

After that, and this is timely, we'll see additional demand
generated by the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which was just
agreed to this week. In UOP we continued to add catalyst capacity in the US and
abroad to support our large installed base in both refining and petrochemical
segments.

On slide 16 we profile another breakthrough technology that we're
investing in, the connected aircraft. Our vision is to create a fast, seamless
online experience for passengers, pilots, and operation staff on the ground. To
supplement our core product, we've invested in M&A in this space with EMS,
Aviaso, SatCom1, and Com Dev, and those investments are beginning to pay off.

With Com Dev's content on 95% of commercial satellites, we
have insight into the networks and services that are going to be needed for
connectivity now and in the future. EMS and SatCom1 provide us with antenna,
modem, and router technology, which is helping us to optimize the way data
travels through the aerospace ecosystem, providing our customers with
incremental value versus the competition.

Lastly, Aviaso provides the software and data analytics
necessary to service airlines. We have recent wins with Etihad Airways,
Finnair, and Lufthansa Cargo to support this. With all these capabilities,
we're now able to supply an aircraft with a big data pipe, JetWave, that is
1,000 times faster and costs 20 times less per megawatt than the previous
systems. No one has the solution that we do with JetWave.

Combined with our legacy expertise around avionics,
mechanical equipment, and services we're positioned to win in the emerging $7
billion connected aircraft space. As you heard Tim say, we anticipated the
connected aircraft business would be larger than $1 billion for us by 2020.

Let's turn to slide 17 to talk about another great position
in a good industry; turbo chargers. As you've heard us say before, we're in the
golden age of turbos, turbo charger adoption continues to be driven by
regulations around fuel economy and emissions.

To comply auto makers are downsizing engines. But to
preserve engine performance they look to our technology, which provides 30%
more torque, 25% percent greater fuel efficiency, and 20% lower carbon dioxide
emissions. In the graph on the right you can see that these factors are driving
incredible growth and penetration.

Today more than one-third of all vehicles have a turbo charger,
and by 2020 we anticipate roughly half of all vehicles will have one on board.
And every year when we look at our data, our long-term forecast for turbo
penetration improves. This is a fantastic growth story for us both in the short
term and long term, particularly as adoption of our light vehicle gas
applications continues to ramp up. We continue to win more than 40% of the OEM
platform competitions globally.

Slide 18 highlights another aspect of why we're so well
positioned for the future, our software capability. We've been developing
software for a long time, much longer than the industrial Internet of Things
became popular. More than half of our 23,000 engineers globally are developing
software. More than 75% of our HOS Gold breakthrough goals are
software-related.

While our expertise has traditionally been in software that
is embedded within our products, we also have about $1 billion of highly
profitable stand-alone software revenue. That number is expected to grow
significantly over the next five years. The engineers are building on our
strong industrial heritage to blend physical products with software.

Last year Honeywell became the first and only large western
company to announce that it is 100% compatible with capability maturity model
integration, that's CMMI level 5, across all global operations and in every
business. This is a big deal. It means we can develop products faster and at a
lower cost than many of our competitors. We also continue to make investments
in our engineering base to ensure we have the best pool of talent driving the
software growth at Honeywell.

Let me turn to slide 19 and talk about high growth regions,
which represent about 40% of the world GDP and collectively are growing north
of 4%. When you compare that to the other 60% of the world which is growing at
less than 2%, it's clearly essential that we are there, and we need to be local
if we're going to be successful in HGRs. We saw these trends early and made the
right investments to insure that we'd get on our fair share of growth.

Since 2003 we've increased our census in high growth regions
by 220%. Our presence is impressive: 140 offices, 70 manufacturing facilities,
and over 58,000 employees. And thanks to our investments, Honeywell's business
in high growth regions has grown at 12% CAGR.

Today HGRs represent about one-quarter of our overall sales
growth, and we expect that number will continue to grow. Slide 20 conveys the
attractive trends and dynamics for the markets in which we participate. Light
hours are growing, and passengers are demanding an on the ground experience
when it comes to connectivity.

Our aerospace business is leading the way with JetWave.
Turbo penetration is increasing. We have the global scale and industry leading
technology that is being adopted by auto makers around the world.

When it comes to the Internet of Things, we have over 11,000
engineers working on valuable software solutions that are helping our customers
optimize their operations. In high growth regions we're addressing demand in the
world's fastest growing economies through innovative local products and
solutions.

In PMT we've invested for growth through capital expansions.
It's too early to call a recovery, but we are seeing signs that the bottom may
have been reached in oil and gas, including month-over-month improvement in
recounts and drilled but uncompleted wells and a stabilizing oil price.

We have a broad catalyst portfolio that allows us to capture
a large percentage of upcoming catalyst reloads in areas where we participate.
We also have leading modular gas processing technology for midstream gas
applications and strong positions in refining and petrochemicals.

We've also invested in capacity for Solstice, which is being
rapidly adopted by automotive and building customers throughout the world to
meet the demand for low global warming products as HFCs are phased out. And
nearly half of Honeywell's current portfolio is dedicated to energy efficiency.

The future is bright for Honeywell. The people and
technologies we have and the investments we have made are tied to favorable
trends in fast growing industries. All this is going to drive future growth.

With that, I'll turn it back over it Dave.

DAVE COTE: So to summarize, we've made the right
investments. We've taken the right portfolio actions, and we have
industry-leading products and services in the right markets. The future will be
quite good for us.

We continue to invest heavily to drive positions on winning
platforms in aerospace and research and development to bring new breakthrough
products and technologies to market, in salespeople and repositioning, and in
capacity expansions and highly profitable businesses, including UOP and
fluorine products. We'll see the benefits of this next year, 2018, and many
years to come. You'll hear Darius and Tom talk a lot more about this in the
outlook call that we'll have in mid-December.

With that, let me turn it over to Mark for Q&A.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: The floor is now open for questions.

(Operator Instructions)

We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with
Barclays.

SCOTT DAVIS, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Hi, good morning.

DAVE COTE: Hey Scott.

SCOTT DAVIS: You've had a few weeks now, we've had three
weeks in October and UOP is a pretty lumpy business. I mean your confidence
seems to be really high that comes back in 4Q. Is that based on what you've
actually started to see in October, or just a function of the backlogs there so
it should start to get released?

DAVE COTE: This is mostly orders that are already there and that
the guys have actually been doing a fair amount of the production already to be
able to ship into the fourth quarter. So we have a high level of confidence on
UOP. Tom, anything you want to add?

TOM SZLOSEK: No, the visibility to the install base is pretty
good. Much of the business is reload activity, and we're tied at the hip with
the customers.

SCOTT DAVIS: Yes, no, I get it. Let me ask it a different
way. I've covered you long enough to know that this stuff gets -- something
pushed from December 20 to January 3, it wouldn't surprise me in UOP because
that's just the nature of the business.

So I know you've got the orders, but your confidence in
actually seeing it in 4Q versus 1Q 2017 based on what you've seen in October.
Has that changed? That's what I'm trying to ask. I didn't ask it very well.

DAVE COTE: No.

SCOTT DAVIS: No meaning, confidence is better or --

DAVE COTE: No, no, no. We're in the same place we were. We
feel good about it. I suppose there's always that chance that it can happen,
but the lumpiness is not so much moving from that we missed a shipment as it is
that when the shipments are going to occur.

They're already planned. They've already got the orders.
They're already producing. We don't see any issues there.

SCOTT DAVIS: Okay. I was just trying to get my arms around
that. It's tough for us to model it. My only other question is the PMT capacity
investments you've made, when you roll that stuff out and you start producing
in 2017, do you make a margin on that right away, or do you have to hit a
certain level of capacity utilization before you really start to make a margin
in that?

DAVE COTE: There's typical startup costs, but it's the --
it's a disciplined startup process. I mean, of course in the first few months
you're not running at full optimization, but it isn't very long after that you
do achieve the impacts of the volume that are coming through.

SCOTT DAVIS: Okay. So you're not losing money out of the
gate, per se. You can actually start making money day one, but obviously that
margin ramps up when your utilization goes higher.

DAVE COTE: That's the expectation, yep.

TOM SZLOSEK: That's true. Yes, it's not a drag from the
beginning.

SCOTT DAVIS: Okay. I was just trying to get my arms around
it. Thank you, I do appreciate it.

DAVE COTE: Thanks Scott.

OPERATOR: And we'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.

STEVE TUSA, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Hey, good morning.

DAVE COTE: Hey, Steve.

STEVE TUSA: Funny we're talking about slippage on this call.
You have done a pretty good job over time of calling annual guidance over the
last ten years, so just an interesting question. But when it comes to
aerospace, you're exiting the year at a pretty negative trend line on organic.

I mean, just to think about the comps next year that give
you confidence that you can hold aero close to the flat line organic. I'm just
kind of thinking about the direction of that business definitely suggests that
it should be down next year organically, just kind of the early read on that.

DAVE COTE: Well, let me put this into context of total 2017,
because I'm assuming that question will come up also. We're going to plan sales
conservatively based on what we're seeing this quarter, and that will include
aero being on the more negative side when we think about business jets and
commercial helicopters.

So we want to make sure that we're consistent with what
we're seeing and that we're not Pollyannaish in any way with our sales
planning. HTSI and RNC will also be coming -- the government services business
and the resins and chemicals business will also be coming out, so we'll have
had like three quarters of both businesses being in in 2016, they'll be out in
2017.

We also have a number of pluses, so we'll have the impact of
restructuring, the aero incentives begins to decline. We've got the impact of
all the acquisitions that we did, and you understand the first year hit we
normally take from there. Interest expense should be a positive.

UOP, SPS, Solstice, those should all be positives. And we're
going to put all this together and have a much more in-depth discussion in
December after we've had a chance to go through all the AOP planning and Darius
and Tom are going to take the lead on that. And that's why we feel comfortable
in saying that even in this slower macro and we think more difficult aero side
on biz jets and commercial helos in particular, that we feel comfortable with
the statements that we've made about 2017.

STEVE TUSA: And that's --

DAVE COTE: Hopefully that helps.

STEVE TUSA: No, that helps a lot, and that's still embedded
in the -- and thanks for the follow up by the way, allowing me to ask a follow
up. And you think that's embedded in the low single-digit guidance that you're
giving? You can still grow the Company with aero down?

DAVE COTE: Yes.

STEVE TUSA: Okay. And then one last question for you. When
it comes to buyback and capital allocation decisions, who's steering the ship
right now? I mean is that collaborative with Darius?

Is that, what is the -- who's making the call on perhaps
doing the bigger buyback? The stock obviously took a hit, your presentation on
Mad Money suggested it was overdone, so who's making the call on the buyback at
this stage?

DAVE COTE: Well, consistent with our policy over the last 15
years, I try to make all of these decisions with no input from anybody.
(laughter)

TOM SZLOSEK: Only Dave's laughing.

DAVE COTE: No, of course it's collaborative. We make no
decisions here without trying to get input from everybody and making sure that
everybody weighs in. So yes, as you might imagine we have a lot of discussion
about it and from time to time we let Darius out of that closet that I talked
about in the last call so we get his input on things.

It's obviously collaborative. Darius is involved. Tom is. We
discuss it with the Board.

It's not a surprise to anyone -- well, except maybe
externally when we do announce it, because we want to be thoughtful in what we
do. And the way we've always tried to run the Company, not just on buybacks but
any decision, is that we want all the input, all the opinions conflicting,
agreeing, whatever they are, so that at the end of the day, we make the best
decisions. I've always felt like we get measured on the quality of our
decisions, not on whether somebody was right or wrong from the beginning, and
that's how we handle the buyback decisions also.

STEVE TUSA: Okay. Thanks a lot.

TOM SZLOSEK: I was just going to add one element to that,
Steve. I mean we're obviously subject to the blackout periods in trading of our
stock, so that comes into play from a timing perspective. But as we've
referenced in the past, we do have some programmed 10B51 types of plans in
place that do a modest amount of activity based on certain levels of trading in
the stock.

STEVE TUSA: Yes, that's fine. You don't need to make it some
big splashy headline. Thanks.

OPERATOR: And we'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan
Stanley.

NIGEL COE, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Good morning. I do want
to echo the comments from Steve. It's amazing how quickly a decade of execution
gets lost in noise, and the transparency provided around this second half mess
I think is well appreciated. So I just wanted to say that.

So aerospace the near-term outlook is pretty ugly. Biz jet
we all know how bad that is right now. When do you see the crossover point
between biz jet moderating, the decline moderating and then the ATROE starting
to pick up? Is that a second half 2017 event, or do you think it's earlier than
that?

DAVE COTE: The ATR side has actually performed fine, and
we're going to continue to see things like A350 pick up, so that's going to be
a benefit to us. The biz jet side and commercial helos should I would suspect
are going to continue to be a market drag for us next year.

When we put all that together, aerospace is still going to
be an important performer for us overall. You saw a fair amount of the
restructuring also occur there, and we think it's going to be a good performer
for us in the long term. But 2017 is still going to be little bit tougher
overall, I think when you put all that together.

NIGEL COE: Is it too early to have confidence in growth, or
is it too touch and go to make that call?

DAVE COTE: Are you talking about growth in the business
overall?

NIGEL COE: For 2017, yes.

DAVE COTE: For 2017 we want to go through the AOP planning
to make sure that we understand all the pieces, but at this point I think we're
probably going to plan this more conservatively than less. So I'd say overall
probably lower sales next year than this year will be the way that we'll plan
for it. We haven't -- we really haven't gone through all our planning process
yet.

NIGEL COE: Understood. And then as a follow on, the $1
billion forecast for Solstice in 2020 is obviously a big number. Can you just
remind us where is the backlog right now for Solstice? What is the current
revenue base, and how do you think the Rwanda agreement, how do you think that
expands the scope for Solstice?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, in rough order of magnitude we're probably
a $400 million or so business currently, and that continues to grow nicely as
we've said. I mean it's more right now mobile air conditioning, which is a
brand new segment for us, but as we continue to progress through it, we get
into buildings and blowing agents and other things.

So it's -- it becomes a broader application for us. As far
as the new regulation, it remains to be seen how that agreement will impact us,
but our forecasts are not dependent upon anything that happened this past week.
We do see it as potential opportunity, but we need to sort through and fully
understand those impacts close to 2020.

DAVE COTE: I would say though, Nigel, it's clearly a good
development, and world's focus on low global warming potential products makes a
difference. If you take a look at the HFCs that our product replaces, HFCs are
up over 1,300 times worse than a single-molecule CO2.

If you take a look at HFOs, our invention, it's actually 0.8
molecules of CO2, so like 1,500 times better than what you would see from HFCs.
So it's a significant new product.

There's a recognition that HFCs do have a big impact,
negative impact on global warming potential, and Solstice, our HFO is just a
tremendous solution for it. And the faster it gets adapted, the more quickly
governments will actually be working to stem the tide of global warming. So we
think it's going to be quite important.

NIGEL COE: Okay. Great, thanks very much.

OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from Andrew Obin
with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

ANDREW OBIN, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: I missed the
preview call because I assumed nothing bad was going to happen. So I was out of
the office. So I'm going to have a follow up question to that.

Just on these incremental aero incentives, my understanding
is that these are in fact tied to faster shipments to customers than previously
agreed. And if that's the case, what's the impact on revenue and profit for
aero in 2017 from taking higher incentives in 2016?

TOM SZLOSEK: So Andrew let me clarify that. The incentives
become due and are recorded and recognized in our financials when the milestones
that govern that incentive are reached. The milestones are generally
development or performance-related milestones. They vary by customer.

So for example, if you hit the first test flight or entry
into service or other types of engineering milestones, those could trigger an
incentive being owed and due and it's recognized in our financials. When you
look at 2016, our P&L has been significantly burdened by, to the tune of
$0.25 as I said earlier of EPS, by incremental OEM incentives.

Next year -- this is the peak year and it starts to tail off
next year. We get a modest tailwind, and then it really accelerates into 2018
and 2019 in terms of the tail wind, yes.

ANDREW OBIN: No, I just want to understand accounting
relationship. Do incentives, because my understanding is that incentives,
higher incentives do rely on hitting milestones earlier as you said does
translate ultimately into faster shipments to the customers. Is that the right
way of thinking about it? Is there a connection?

TOM SZLOSEK: It's not a direct connection because, I mean
the incentives for us are largely based on the development process and bringing
the aircraft to production. And so while you might incrementally get to faster
production, you still have to have orders, you still have to have selling, and
those cycle times generally are unaffected by -- or incentives are generally
unaffected by those activities.

ANDREW OBIN: And just a follow-up question.

DAVE COTE: Andrew, I should add these are good investments
for us to be making. We expense everything as incurred. We don't put it on the
balance sheet, so we take our hits as they're occurring, unlike others who put
it on the balance sheet and you see it over time.

So for us while it's painful in the short term, it sure as
heck helps where you're going in the long term. And these were decisions that
we made several years ago to make sure that we were on the right platforms with
the right kinds of products and services going forward.

So this is pretty smart money. It's painful in the short
term, but it's smart money and positions us extremely well for the future.

ANDREW OBIN: And just a follow-up question on connection
between global airline passenger traffic and your commercial aviation
aftermarket. You were up one. My understanding is that global passenger traffic
was up mid-single digits. Is there a reason for the disconnect? Is there
destocking deferred maintenance, or anything else driving the difference? Thank
you.

DAVE COTE: Well, this is one that's always kind of
interesting when you look at aftermarket versus flight hours, because while
flight hours develop pretty consistently over time and they tend to go up 3% or
4% a year; even in a bad time, they'll go down for a single year and then pop
back up again. So that trend is always relatively smooth.

The aftermarket stream associated with it, though, bounces
around in sometimes crazy directions. If you recall the recession, for example,
where flight hours were down 3% or 4%, aftermarket was down something like 20%
or 30% in that same year.

So the long-term trend is generally consistent with what
those flight hours are. In the short term it can bounce around quite a bit, so
being able to explain the difference between say 3% and 1% is easily within the
realm of typical variability.

TOM SZLOSEK: The other thing I'd add to that, Andrew, is
that you've got a combination of both air transport and business jets in that
1%. We talked a little bit about the slowdown on the business jet RNO activity.
I was going through the slides, and that has contributed to this.

ANDREW OBIN: Thank you so much. Hopefully we'll go back to
non-eventful and good hunt quarters. Thanks a lot.

DAVE COTE: Yes, it will.

OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from Steven
Winoker from Bernstein.

STEVEN WINOKER, ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN & CO.:
Thanks and good morning, all. Appreciate the patience and color through all the
questions. It's really very helpful and some parts very entertaining.
(laughter)

Listen, I just want to first follow up the earlier comments
on UOP and fourth-quarter confidence. The question specifically, if you look at
the incremental, you've got this 20% growth and whatnot, orders on the catalyst
side, where are the incremental catalyst volumes going to? If you think about
refining versus petchem for that part of the growth, is there any impact at all
from first wave Gulf Coast crackers that have been delayed?

DAVE COTE: Wow, that's a level of specificity, Steve, I'd
have to say we'll have to get back to you on that one.

STEVEN WINOKER: Okay. But in terms of -- just so you know in
advance, this is an investor discussion based on just concerns about that
visibility even in those end markets for other companies, so that's where that
comes from. That would be helpful. The second one, Dave -- you'll love this, I
think.

Just hope you're sitting on this one. It's like a bad
relationship where one bad thing happens and all of a sudden everything else
comes out, right. So in a lot of investor discussions I've been certainly
defending Honeywell's growth in aerospace and margins versus the margins in
aerospace over time.

The assertion is that Honeywell somehow has been trading off
growth for margin expansion when you look at specific platform wins. And as you
say in slide 13, large wins on the right platforms to accelerate growth. I'd
like to give you an opportunity to maybe address that directly to a lot of
investors out there who are concerned about this from a higher level
perspective.

DAVE COTE: Yes, it's one I always kind of wonder so what
date are they looking at when it comes to -- I assume this is the market share
question, Steve?

STEVEN WINOKER: Mostly, yes.

DAVE COTE: Yes. Because if you look at the dater, it
actually looks very good for us. And to your point, we are selective on the
platforms that we pick. I've always been shocked at the investor reception when
one of our competitors says that they've won 32 of the last 25 competitions,
and when you say, geez, now they're winning over 100% of all the competitions
out there, how is that possible? And I think they're getting a little carried
away with what do they count and what do they not count.

If you take a look at our avionics performance, it's quite
good and there's future stuff that we'll end up talking about at some point. If
you take a look at the concessions that we're paying right now, for example,
that you would look at that and say, oh, that yielded a bunch of good platforms
also.

When you look at the amount of R&D that we spend in
aerospace it's kind of -- I don't know what the heck they're pointing to when
they say it. It's one thing to be able to say some of this stuff.

It's a little different when you actually have to back it
up. I just have a tough time seeing it. I don't know where they're getting it
from.

STEVEN WINOKER: Okay. All right. And then finally on the
capital deployment front, you have repeated the kind of window or envelope that
you have to work with over a few years of something in the order of $25
billion.

There's always a big difference between what you could spend
and what you will spend and when and how obviously. So as you look at the
market now and you look at the discussions you're having with huge pipeline
that Ann and company and everybody has developed, what's your level of optimism
again and the kind of types of M&A activity that investors should be
prepared for?

DAVE COTE: Well, it's always tough to predict, as we've said
before, and we're going to continue to do both the divestitures and
acquisitions in a way that causes us to improve the overall growth profile of
the company. The problem of course is you can't predict them.

You can't say it's $2 billion a year, $5 billion a year.
It's going to be 0 one year, $6 billion another. You just don't know.

So we have to take our opportunities as they arise, and
we'll continue to do that. We do have a good balance sheet, like having that.
We think that gives us the opportunity to be smart when it comes time to doing
a deal or when it comes time to having the capability to repurchase, and we'll
continue to be opportunistic on both.

STEVEN WINOKER: Okay. All right. And I guess maybe just one
last follow up there. In terms of software solutions stuff versus consolidating
products, is everything on the table or directing more one way?

DAVE COTE: Are you saying from an acquisition perspective,
Steve?

STEVEN WINOKER: Yes, yes, yes.

DAVE COTE: Yes, there's -- well the nice thing about having
so many opportunities and so many places for us to go, all the stuff you talked
about is interesting, whether it's technology, software, stuff that does a
better job of connecting the digital physical world. So there's a lot of places
for us to run here.

It's really a question of what's available and is the price
right. We're still always going to be very conscience that price makes a
difference.

If you pay for a strategy because the strategy is right,
what ends up happening is the seller is the one who made all the money on the
strategy, not you. We're going to continue to be thoughtful about how do we do
that.

STEVEN WINOKER: Okay. Thanks, good luck.

DAVE COTE: Thanks.

TOM SZLOSEK: Thanks Steve.

OPERATOR: And we'll go next to Howard Rubel with Jefferies.

HOWARD RUBEL, ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC: Thank you. I'm not
going to ask an aerospace question, I think I know that market pretty well.
Instead I'd like to --

DAVE COTE: Wow, I was prepared, Howard. I was prepared for
that and for someday for them to actually pronounce your last name correctly.

HOWARD RUBEL: Well, you're taking the words out of my mouth,
but I'm going to try on restructuring for a moment and -- because you talk
about it as being a permanent change to the way in which you're going to be
able to compete and run the business. How -- can you give us some of the nuts
and bolts behind this? Because it's a very large number and probably is very
meaningful to several of the businesses.

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, well, you can start Howard, with
aerospace. You know that over the course of the year because of the volumes as
well as driving HOS, we've deployed a fair amount of restructuring to that
business, and a lot of that is pretty quick turnaround kinds of paybacks.

When we did the desegregation of ACS we also went through a
significant management spans and layers exercise, so what we try to do is limit
and reduce the number of layers that we have from the top boss down to the
lowest level person in the organization. We've also tried to increase the span
of control for each of our managers.

That also took up a bunch of the capacity that we spent in
the third quarter. And I'd say thirdly, in our supply chain we continue to have
lots of opportunities, whether it's continued integration of acquisitions that
we've done or just addressing legacy sites.

We've found opportunities and still have more ahead of us to
invest in restructuring and attractive payback projects. So it's a combination
of the reorganization that we've done as well as the continuing -- continual
addressing of our ISC, our supply chain. And then the third thing I'd say is
the acquisitions that we've done to achieve the cost synergies that we talk
about, you do have to apply restructuring.

Again, those do deliver anywhere between 6% and 8% percent
of cost synergies on the acquisition. A bunch of that comes from just
leveraging our sourcing agreements.

But some of it is from restructuring as well. And so those
are the three principal areas, and as a result you're seeing that 2017 tailwind
from the pool of funded projects that we have, as I said.

HOWARD RUBEL: And then the follow-up questions on software,
as you are able to transition away from selling a product but instead selling
upgrades and I'll call it enhancements or increased applications, can you,
Dave, provide us with some -- I mean to some degree that provides some
substantial margin headwind or opportunity rather or tailwind rather, margin
and tailwind going forward. Could you provide some context of how you've been
able to see that and what I'd call give us some hard examples? Because it could
be quite compelling.

DAVE COTE: I'm sorry, Howard, I'm not sure I followed that
one. Hard examples of what exactly?

HOWARD RUBEL: For example, in avionics instead of having to
sell a box you sell a software upgrade. So the software costs you a minimal
amount of money and yet it enhances the value of the aircraft.

DAVE COTE: Got it. I understand and yes you're correct, and
of course we expense all our R&D as we go along. We don't put any of that
on the balance sheet either.

So we take the hits for the R&D, which can be
substantial if you're trying to develop software, but once you do and you start
selling the software packages and the upgrades, so whether it's weather radar
or a runway incursion or excursion, possibilities, the JetWave. As you start to
get into that it is substantial. The margin rates are significantly better.

HOWARD RUBEL: That applies not just to aero though, it
applies I would think to elements of home and building or process control, and
I was just hoping maybe you can provide us with a sense of where you are today
and where you might be in three to five years in terms of just the intensity of
the business change?

DAVE COTE: I wouldn't put any numbers on it at this point,
but your concept is absolutely correct. The -- that is definitely the -- let's
say the direction of the Company and it's why we focused as much as we do on
software, and I think puts us in position for a very good future for the entire
Company. We've got a bigger advantage here than anybody else with almost half
of our engineers focused on software today. It puts us in a much better
position.

HOWARD RUBEL: Thank you very much, gentlemen.

DAVE COTE: Thanks, Howard.

OPERATOR: And we'll go next to Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical
Research Partners.

JEFFREY SPRAGUE, ANALYST, VERTICAL RESEARCH PARTNERS: Thank
you, good morning, everyone.

DAVE COTE: Hey Jeff.

JEFFREY SPRAGUE: Good morning. Just want to get my head
around restructuring for 2017, not benefits of what you've already
accomplished, but new actions. I think on the slide if I interpret it
correctly, you're saying the tax rate benefit from the share accounting change
will be restructured away.

I'm wondering if we should expect the same for any pension
benefits that flow through on service costs, and are those the two main toggles
that would actually define what your restructuring would be next year, or is
there some other expected danger, other things? Anything you can frame there
would be helpful.

DAVE COTE: Yes, the way I would think about it, Jeff, is you
probably noticed that over a long period of time we do a lot of restructuring.
If we've got some kind of unusual gain, we usually use it to restructure. We
take a lot through operations generally every quarter.

It's one of those things where we want to constantly be
investing. We're not going to run out of ideas. I wouldn't want to go into too
much detail until we've had a chance to go through all our AOP planning, but I
would be surprised if next year we didn't also have additional restructuring
ideas as we went along and that we'll find a way to fund them.

JEFFREY SPRAGUE: It's meaningfully not lower number than it
was in 2016?

DAVE COTE: Well, in 2016 of course we had a big boost as we
figured out how to do the additional restructuring in the third quarter. I
wouldn't anticipate that we'd do something that big again next year, but you
never know. I don't want to -- as you know, I never say never on any of this
stuff, but the whole ideas of how do you just constantly have a good pipeline
of ideas and find a way to fund the really good ones so that you do the seed
planting for the future, that's something we're going to continue doing.

JEFFREY SPRAGUE: And just back to the OEM incentives maybe
one more time, obviously the accounting is very conservative. Just wonder if
you could give us a little thought though on the return metrics as you think
about making the investments.

Obviously the ultimate success or failure of the investment
is going to depend on the commercial success of the airplane and units sold and
all that, but what kind of return thresholds do you use when you think about
these investments? And what kind of cushion versus weighted average cost of
capital or whatever metric you use to kind of decide if you pull the trigger on
this sort of stuff?

DAVE COTE: Yes, the -- I guess there's a couple of things
that we end up looking at. I won't put a specific number on the return because
that's -- I just don't think that's a good thing to have public out there. But
this has to be a high return project.

The same sort of thing that we look at for any internal
investment because that's what it is. And that's why we pay so much attention
to what platform is it and what do we really think is going to happen. So we
don't just take an external look or the customers look at what do they think
it's going to be, but we really go through this ourselves to say what do we
really think is possible here, and how do we make sure that this is going to
generate a good return for the Company.

Our guys do a pretty good job of this so that we pick the
right platforms. And when you see the concessions that we are paying, it's been
so that we could do that. So these are going to be high return very good IRR
projects and platforms that we're on. We're pretty confident of that based on
what we've done and what we see.

TOM SZLOSEK: Jeff, the way I think of it is we have a very
disciplined process when it comes to considering whether we compete for a new
platform that's a potential opportunity for us. It's as disciplined as an
M&A process, so we consider all of the investments. These incentives are
one aspect of that.

I mean there's a lot of engineering time and project
management time that also goes into the outflows or the investments that you're
making. And then of course you consider all the future revenues and the models
and so forth. It's as disciplined as M&A.

And as Dave said, we have internal returns that we look to
as the hurdles. We'll go ahead with the ones that do meet those attractive
rates.

DAVE COTE: And for what it's worth, Jeff, we're very
conscious of the time value of money.

JEFFREY SPRAGUE: Okay. Great I appreciate it. Thank you.

DAVE COTE: Thanks, Jeff.

OPERATOR: And we'll go next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman
Sachs.

JOE RITCHIE, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Thanks, good morning.

DAVE COTE: Hey, Joe.

JOE RITCHIE: So my first question is on slide 7, when you
take a look at your margin bridge for next year and you see all the headwinds
that are basically going away, it's about 150 basis points. You're doing a
bunch of restructuring this year, you think growth is going to get better next
year, and yet where the planning for next year is 45 to 75 basis points it
seems really conservative. What am I missing here?

DAVE COTE: I would say we've done our -- we think we've
provided a lot of color commentary on 2017 at this point, more than we normally
ever would. And I would just say stay tuned for the December outlook call.
We'll go through a lot more detail then with Darius and Tom to be able to
explain what will we see and why.

And we're going to be very conscious of having gotten burned
on the macro environment this year, and as conservative as I thought we were
being in the beginning we weren't conservative enough. So we're going to want
to make sure that as we pull together a plan for 2017 that it's one that never
ends up with the kind of snail surprise that we ended up taking this year.

JOE RITCHIE: That's fair, Dave, and definitely good to be
conservative into next year. Maybe my one follow up is really just on the
M&A that you've done.

Tom, I think you'd mentioned on the prior call that the
growth was running at about high single digits, and I think the accretion was
kind of coming in towards the higher end of your range. I'm just wondering how
much of the deal-related costs, the inventory step up, how much of those costs
go away next year? And then where -- are we still running at the same kind of
growth and EPS rates for this year?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, well, first if you look at the -- I mean
the deals that we've integrated this year, most of them were closed in the
fourth quarter or the first quarter. And yes, you had a lot of startup costs in
particularly the first three quarters of this year. Intelligrated, which we
closed in late August, will add to those one-time startups.

But net/net when you consider amortization and inventory
accounting and the other things, the year-over-year impact will be favorable on
those deals. But the more important thing is that the operations and the cost
synergies that we get typically start to ramp in the second half of the first
year into the second year.

And that's where you start to see the margin rate improvement.
So we'll go through the in details in December, but this should be a nice
contributor to what we had for 2017.

JOE RITCHIE: Okay. Fair enough, thanks.

OPERATOR: And we'll take our last question from Christopher
Glynn with Oppenheimer.

CHRISTOPHER GLYNN, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER & CO.: Wow.
Thanks. I'll get my two up front. Dave, had a question on your sales employee
census data up 10%, didn't look like it grew much in 2015 despite higher
M&A. The increase looks like a big organic component.

Just wondering where the raw head count is and where it's
especially ROI sensitive. And then my second question would be probably a
follow on to Joe's, if you'd quantify what the purchase accounting burden is in
2016 in terms of EPS?

DAVE COTE: Yes, on the first one on salespeople, a lot of
those have been deployed to what we refer to as high growth regions. And the
reason for highlighting it, of course, is that when you hire salespeople
there's training and familiarization that has to go on. So they're not immediately
productive.

It's the sort of thing that shows up in the future. I won't
-- difficult to quantify at this point what that's worth to us say next year
and the year after. But it's another investment that -- where we take the
expense up front, because of course you've got to pay them while the sales
numbers they deliver aren't quite enough to pay for themselves in those first
years.

So this is a good thing for us to be doing, a good way for
us to expand our high growth region presence, but it's the sort of thing that's
another investment for the future for us. On the restructuring side, I don't --
I know we've shared some data, not restructuring, the --

CHRISTOPHER GLYNN: Purchase accounting.

DAVE COTE: Purchase accounting, yes. Tom, I don't know that
I want to go too much more than what we've already disclosed here.

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, I think we keep it at an overall
contribution. For 2016 M&A is -- we guided at $0.05 to $0.15 of overall
contribution to EPS. And that is an all in number that takes into account all
of those one-time costs as well as the pure operations.

In 2017 you can expect that to be a bigger number as a
result of a lot of those costs going away. You can kind of calibrate it when we
provide that in December.

CHRISTOPHER GLYNN: All right. See you in December.

DAVE COTE: All right. Thanks, Chris.

OPERATOR: That concludes today's question-and
answer-session. Mr. Cote, at this time I will turn the conference back to you
for any additional or closing remarks.

DAVE COTE: Yes, thank you. On October 7 we went out of our
way to be transparent. With our focus on transparency, I lost sight of how
important it was to also convey our confidence in the future.

Hopefully our confidence in that future came across today.
We look forward to sharing more with you in our December outlook call. Thank
you.

OPERATOR: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to
Honeywell's second-quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

(Operator Instructions)

As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like
to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.:
Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's second-quarter 2016
earnings conference call. With me here today, as always, our Chairman and CEO,
Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek.

This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP
reconciliations, are available on our website at 

. Note that elements to this
presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view
of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can
change, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the
principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K
and other SEC filings.

This morning, we'll review our financial results for the
second quarter and share with you our guidance for the third quarter and
full-year 2016, and as always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.
With that, I'll call over to Chairman and CEO Dave Cote.

DAVE COTE, CHAIRMAN & CEO, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.:
Good morning, everyone.

As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another
quarter of double-digit earnings growth, capping off a strong first half to the
year in a challenging global economy. Earnings per share of $1.66 increased
10%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Sales of $10 billion were
up 2% on a reported basis and down 2% on a core organic basis, in line with our
guidance for the quarter. We saw good growth in Commercial Aviation Aftermarket
and Transportation Systems; in our Residential, Commercial, and China
businesses within ACS; and in Process Solutions and Flooring Products in PMT.
Segment margin expanded 10 basis points to 18.5%. On an operational basis, this
was 110 basis points of improvement as we continue our focus on commercial
excellence, execution on previously funded restructuring actions, and maintaining
disciplined cost controls. We are again raising the low end of our 2016
full-year earnings guidance to a new range of $6.60 to $6.70, or up 8% to 10%
year over year, given our first-half performance.

During the second quarter, we had several announcements that
I'd like to highlight this morning. We announced that Darius Adamczyk will be
our next CEO, effective March 31, 2017, and I will serve as Executive Chairman
through April 2018. This announcement is the next step in ensuring a seamless
leadership transition, which will position Honeywell for continued
outperformance in 2017 and beyond. Darius is the right person to lead the
Company into a new era, where we will need to keep evolving to become even more
global, to become more of a software company, and to become more nimble. He has
the growth mindset, global acumen, and software expertise to be a highly
successful CEO for Honeywell. The Board and I are confident that Darius will be
a great leader in executing our strategic plans and driving organic growth. My
leadership team and I remain as focused as ever in delivering on our
commitments while ensuring a smooth leadership transition.

In addition, this morning we announced that we will realign
ACS into two new segments: Home and Building Technologies, and Safety and
Productivity Solutions. We'll begin reporting results on this basis in the
third quarter. Tom will speak more about this later, but we think this is the
right time to separate ACS into two smaller, more nimble businesses that will
operate more efficiently and adapt more quickly to change in global markets. We
have two fantastic leaders in Terrence Hahn and John Waldron to lead the new
segments. And we're excited about the growth opportunities in each portfolio as
we look ahead to 2017.

Alex Ismail, who served as President and CEO of Automation
and Control Solutions for the past two years, will leave the Company. Alex had
a very successful career in Honeywell in Aerospace Transportation Systems, and
most recently, ACS, where he delivered strong operating margin expansion and
improved operational excellence; completed several acquisitions in new
strategic adjacencies, like smart meters; accelerated growth in high-growth
regions; and built a strong pipeline of new products: IoT solutions and software
for home building and worker applications. Alex is very supportive of the
change. He's a well-liked and respected leader, and we wish him the best in his
next endeavor.

We remain very active on the capital deployment front also.
Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Intelligrated for $1.5
billion. Intelligrated serves the high-growth e-commerce industry, offering
complete warehouse automation solutions, software, and services. Intelligrated
has a large and growing installed base of customers that align well with our
new Safety and Productivity Solutions business, and they serve a highly
attractive market that is forecasted to grow 8% to 10% a year. We also
announced the spinoff of our Resins and Chemicals business into an independent
public company called AdvanSix. The spinoff of AdvanSix is progressing well,
and we expect completion this year. These portfolio changes continue to move
our growth profile upward and build on our great positions in good industries.

In June, Shane Tedjarati and his team hosted approximately
20 investors and analysts in China to learn more about Honeywell's tremendous
growth opportunities in high-growth regions. The trip covered four cities in
five days and included meetings with Chinese government officials, local
economists and CEOs, visits to innovation centers and high-tech incubators,
site tours of Honeywell's turbo factory in Wuhan and S&PS factory in
Suzhou, as well as an in-depth HGR business review. This trip served as an
excellent venue for our shareholders and analysts to better understand our HGR
strategies, including becoming the Chinese competitor, east for east, and east
for [est]. And how our experience in China has delivered our strategic thinking
and provided a foundation for further growth in other high-growth regions.
High-growth regions have driven approximately 50% of our growth over the last
10 years, and we expect it to continue to be a key growth engine for Honeywell
going forward.

And our focus on software continues with the announcement of
our new digital transformation business, part of Honeywell Process Solutions.
This business will help industrial companies harness the power of the
industrial Internet of Things to make their operations more reliable, more
efficient, and safer. The Industrial Internet of Things was the key topic at
our 41st Annual Honeywell User Group Conference in San Antonio, where we
introduced our new Uniformance Suite. This Suite is our analytics platform that
provides real-time digital intelligence to turn plant data into actionable
information. At the User Group Conference, more than 1,000 people gathered to
discuss IIoT's tremendous potential to solve the toughest challenges facing
industrial companies today. Honeywell's portfolio of technologies, advanced
analytics, and deep domain knowledge position us well to utilize data to help
customers operate their plants more safely and efficiently, and reduce
unplanned downtime.

We're also monitoring the macro environment in light of
Britain's recently-announced exit from the European Union. And we expect
minimal near-term impact. Tom will take you through some of the actions we've
taken to mitigate potential risk, but it's important to note that our planning
framework hasn't changed. We'll be cautious in our sales planning and continue
to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a
Company. And we'll maintain our seed planting for the future, supported by a
robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects. We'll continue to support
growth, focusing on winning in high-growth regions, advancing our superior
software capabilities, and effectively using HOS Gold to drive break-through
initiatives and deliver high-quality products to our customers globally.

With that, I'll turn it over to Tom.

TOM SZLOSEK, SVP & CFO, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.:
Thanks, Dave. Good morning.

I'm now on slide 3, which shows the second quarter results.
Reported sales of $10 billion increased 2%, reflecting impact of acquisitions,
and declined 2% on a core organic basis. We saw continued growth in our
Commercial Aviation Aftermarket, Security and Fire Process Solutions, and
Transportation Systems, which I'll talk more about on the business slides. The
continued declines in our oil and gas businesses in UOP and difficult comps in
S&PS were largely as we expected.

In our high-growth regions, India grew nearly 30%, while in
China, Aero and ACS continued the momentum from the first quarter, partially
offset by moderating declines in PMT. All of our recent acquisitions are performing
at or above the deal financial models, and the sales from our seven recent
acquisitions collectively grew in the high single-digit basis on a core organic
basis this quarter. Segment margin was up 10 basis points versus the prior
year, at the high end of our guidance range; or up 50 basis points, excluding
the dilutive impact of acquisitions. As Dave mentioned, on an operational basis
-- so that's further excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, the Aerospace
OEM incentives, and raw material pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals
-- segment margin improved 110 basis points. We expect the overall margin
expansion will continue to improve in the second half.

Earnings per share of $1.66 were up 10%, coming in at the
high end of our guidance range. Also, we funded $97 million of restructuring
projects -- that's $53 million net of reversals -- largely offsetting the
benefit from higher pension income in the quarter, as expected. On share count,
we repurchased another 500 million of shares at attractive prices. On a
full-year basis, we expect the fully-diluted weighted average share count to be
approximately 774 million shares. We have been and will continue to deploy
capital to appropriate opportunities that will create the greatest value for
our shareholders.

Free cash flow in the quarter: $1.3 billion improved
sequentially and was up 8%, as compared to the second quarter of 2015,
representing approximately 100% free cash flow conversion. The increase year
over year was driven primarily by improving net income. Even with the increase
in free cash flow, we were able to fund at 16% more in capital expenditures, or
approximately $280 million in the quarter. These are principally the high-ROI
projects that we've discussed in the past. As you can see, we continue to
generate strong results in a relatively slow-growth environment.

Slide 4 provides a quick recap of our year-to-date growth in
the portfolio. Roughly 70% of the Honeywell portfolio is growing at a 5% core
organic rate, led by Fluorine Products, Security and Fire, Process Solutions,
and Transportation Systems, as well as the five other businesses shown here. We
have good visibility to continued outperformance based on our orders and
backlog, stable end markets, and new wins. And this outperformance includes
overcoming the significant Aero OEM incentives we face in our Commercial
Aviation Business. So a good sign as we head into the second half of 2016.

For the other 30% of the portfolio, core organic sales
growth year to date has declined 13%, due to the known headwinds that we
discussed previously. We've highlighted the market headwinds in our oil and gas
businesses and UOP, which bottoms out in 2016; also, the tough comps from the
completion of the US Postal Service win in S&PS; and the softness in our
Services and International Business within Defense and Space, as well as the
market pricing headwinds in Resins and Chemicals. These headwinds are largely
expected to subside in the second half of 2016 and into 2017. We think the
slide illustrates the diversity of opportunity within the Honeywell portfolio.
There is not one business that will make or break us. We continue to be
confident about the portfolio and the positions we have as we look to the
second half of 2016 and to 2017.

Slide 5 provides more detail on our earnings per share for
the quarter. Our operating initiatives, led by the deployment of HOS, continue
to drive segment profit growth. On an operational basis, segment profit
accounted for $0.16 of EPS growth in the quarter. We generated 110 basis points
of operational improvement in segment margin, which compares well with
the100-plus basis point improvement we saw for the full year of 2015. Each of
the segments are contributing. We have differentiated technologies with the
software focus, and Honeywell User Experience is driving a development of new
products at higher margins.

Our factories and sourcing organizations continue to mature.
Our functional transformation is improving the quality of our back office while
reducing its costs, and we continue to manage our indirect spend stringently,
in addition to previously funded restructuring, as well as new restructuring
actions, have enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position. The
other impacts you see on the slide combine for a $0.01 decline in earnings for
the quarter. First, the M&A-related charges stemming from the 8 deals in
the last 12 months resulted in $0.05 in year-over-year dilution, primarily due
to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go cost, with Elster having the
largest impact. The incremental amortization from the deals will be a margin
headwind for the rest of the year, as we anticipated, but the net results from
all acquisitions should improve in the second half as we lapse some of the
large one-time costs. Each of our acquisitions are performing well, and are at
or above our deal models. And as I mentioned, the organic growth embedded in
these portfolios that we acquired, which is not included in our overall organic
growth numbers, has been outstanding.

Second, foreign currency represented a $0.04 headwind in the
quarter and should be roughly $0.15 for the full year. You'll recall that our
hedging approach resulted in a euro rate of 1.24 for 2015, versus 1.10 for
2016. Third, Aerospace OEM incentives reflect our continued investment in
developing and growing our install base on the right platforms in the
commercial aviation industry. We now anticipate the full-year 2016
year-over-year impact from OEM incentives to be more than $200 million, and the
Q2 impact was approximately $0.03. Lastly, below the line items, in share count
we're net positive year over year by $0.07 and $0.04, respectively, as we
previewed. On share count, our repurchases through the end of the second
quarter were an average price of $106 per share. So overall, strong earnings
results while overcoming significant headwinds in what continues to be an
uncertain macro environment.

Let's move to slide 6. As Dave said, we announced the
acquisition of Intelligrated earlier this month, building on the $6
billion-plus of acquisitions we've completed since the beginning of 2015.
Intelligrated designs, manufactures, integrates, and installs complete
warehouse automation solutions -- software and services that result in smarter
distribution and fulfillment operations. Its supply chain and warehouse
solutions drive improved productivity and lower costs for retailers,
manufacturers, and logistic providers around the world. The company's offerings
include conveyor, sortation, palletizers, and robotics, as well as automated
storage and retrieval systems, all managed by advanced machine controls and
software.

Intelligrated's software offers warehouse execution systems,
a scalable suite of software that manages the entire fulfillment process,
including equipment, labor, and business intelligence, integrated with voice-
and light-directed picking and putting technologies. Intelligrated's
mission-critical warehouse execution systems and software are fantastic
complements to the scanning, mobile computer, and voice automation technologies
in S&PS. They have a large and growing install base, which includes 30 of
the top 50 US retailers and 50 of the top 100 Internet retailers. They also
maintain a strong leadership position in the approximately $20 billion warehouse
automation segment. About 90% of the business today is in the US, so there are
significant opportunities to expand globally through Honeywell's footprint and
customer diversification.

Intelligrated is at the intersection of several key global
mega-trends, namely e-commerce, software, and automation, with distinguished
sales growth in a market that is forecast to grow 8% to 10% a year. S&PS
was built initially through acquisitions, which we've continually expanded
through strong organic growth and operational improvements -- a good testament
to our rigorous and proven M&A approach and the benefits of being patient
with our capital deployment. We expect this transaction to close by the end of
the third quarter, and we're excited about the opportunities this acquisition
has to offer.

Let's turn to page 7. We wanted to spend a moment addressing
Honeywell's proactive positioning ahead of Britain's recently-announced exit
from the European Union. You're all familiar with the developments and
uncertainties, and we've received a lot of questions about the impact on
Honeywell. The process of actually exiting the EU will take some time, and thus
may cause greater uncertainty in the short term, in addition to potentially
slower UK and EU economic growth longer-term. We will continue to monitor our
European short cycle businesses for any signs of change, but as a reference
point, our core organic sales in the EU region have held up nicely year to
date. We will continue to be cautious in sales planning and stay conservative in
terms of our cost structure and investments in the region. In addition to the
ongoing productivity initiatives in our supply chain and functions, we're also
prepared to leverage the flexibility we have to quickly adjust cost levels as
the need arises.

As it relates to currency, we've continued our foreign
currency hedging approach. We've hedged approximately 75% of our 2017 euro
P&L exposure at $1.15, and roughly 50% of our 2017 British P&L exposure
at $1.44. So while there may continue to be volatility on the sales line, our
euro- and pound-based earnings are protected, similar to the approach we took
for 2016. We will continue to actively monitor the situation as we head into
2017.

Let's move to slide 8 and discuss the Aerospace results.
Sales declined 1%, or 2% on a core organic basis, below our expectations,
primarily driven by weaker-than-expected sales in Defense and Space, which I'll
explain further in a moment. The Commercial Aviation OE sales decreased by 8%
on a core organic basis, as higher volumes with OEMs and Air Transport and
Regional were more than offset by a seven point headwind from higher OEM
incentives and lower engine shipments in Business and General Aviation. The BGA
OE business, in particular, faced a difficult prior year comparison, which, as
a reminder, grew north of 20% in the second quarter of 2015. And as we
highlighted last month, the demand environment in business jets overall is
slower. Commercial Aviation aftermarket sales continued to be robust, growing
6% on a core organic basis. On the spares side, we saw an increase in airline
and BGA spares, driven by strong mechanical demand and higher GX aviation
sales, including Satcom and software upgrades.

Repair or overhaul activities increased in line with flight
hours, which remained strong in the second quarter as well. Defense and Space
sales declined 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by difficult
prior-year comparisons in the international business, as larger projects were
completed, as well as lower sales to key channel partners. Our US Services and
Space Businesses declined year over year, due to unexpected program delays and
completions of other programs. But we continue to perform well in our US
aftermarket business, with increased spares and retrofit sales. In addition,
our commercial helicopter business continues to be impacted by declines in the
oil and gas markets. Reported sales reflect the impact of Com Dev, of the
satellite communications acquisition, which has performed well this year.

Transportation system sales increased 3% on a core organic
basis, due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both gas and
diesel light vehicle applications. We continue to grow in our light vehicle
diesel business in Europe, which was up single digit in the quarter. The growth
in light vehicle gas was also most prominent in Europe and China.

Aerospace segment margin expanded 60 basis points, or 80
basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by
productivity, net of inflation, and commercial excellence, partially offset by
continued investments for growth, including higher OEM incentives, and the
unfavorable impact of foreign currency.

Let's turn to the ACS results on slide 9. ACS sales
increased 9%, reflecting the favorable impact from acquisitions, primarily
Elster. On a core organic basis, sales were down minus 1% in the second
quarter, in line with our guidance. The segment margin expansion improved to 50
basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of M&A, a big improvement
from the 10 basis points expansion in the first quarter. And we expect ongoing
acceleration in the second half of the year.

Sales in Energy, Safety and Security for the Products
businesses were down 2% on a core organic basis in the second quarter. The momentum
continued in Security and Fire globally, with strong growth rates in both
residential and commercial markets, coupled with the benefit from new product
introductions and further penetration in high-growth regions. Our China
business overall in ESS drew high single-digit in the quarter, and we saw
double-digit growth in India. We've continued to outperform in our high-growth
regions, driven by our connected ACS China strategy and the benefits from our
ongoing investments for growth. These improvements were offset by lower volume
in S&PS, primarily from the 2015 completion of the US Postal Service
contract. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth quarter.

Building Solutions and Distribution sales were up 3% on a
core organic basis in the quarter. We experienced continued strength on the
distribution side, with strong growth in North America and EMEA across our
Video Access and Intrusion product line. In Building Solutions, we saw modest
growth, reflecting strength and services, partially offset by softness in the
Project Installation business. Orders growth in the Services and Energy
Retrofit businesses was more than offset by declines in the Project Businesses,
but we remain encouraged by the solid improvements we've seen in our energy
portfolio in HBS. Orders have doubled in that portfolio through the first half
of 2016. This is been driven by sales excellence and a differentiated offering
that is leading to multiple awards. The Building Solutions backlog and Service
Bank increased low single digit in the quarter, on an organic basis.

Segment margins: ACS continues to benefit from productivity
initiatives. The favorable impacts from restructuring and commercial excellence
while maintaining investments for growth in our connected product offerings and
in high-growth regions. Mix was slightly better than the last quarter, and we
expect this to continue in the second half.

On page 10 -- I'm now on page 10 -- this morning we
highlighted that ACS would be split into two newly created business groups. I want
to share a little bit more information on that with you. The first, Home and
Building Technologies, will be roughly a $9 billion enterprise, which comprises
our legacy Environmental and Energy Solutions, including Elster; Security and
Fire; and Building Solution and Distribution Businesses. E&ES' Industrial,
Combustion, and Thermal business will be reclassified to PMT. The HBT business
will be led by Terrence Hahn, who previously ran our Transportation Systems
Unit for the past three years, and has been with Honeywell for over nine years.

The second segment, Safety and Productivity Solutions, will
be roughly a $5 billion business, comprising the former Sensing and
Productivity Solutions and Industrial Safety businesses, including the recent
acquisition of Intelligrated. The new SPS will be led by John Waldron, who is
currently President of our Sensing and Productivity Solutions business unit and
previously was President of Scanning and Mobility.

Today's announcement represents yet another step in the evolution
of the Honeywell portfolio. We're constantly looking at ways to improve our
organic growth profile, and we think a smaller, more focused segment structure
will allow us to accelerate breakthrough growth and new product introduction by
being closer to our customers. Also, fewer layers and structures will lead to
faster decision-making and a more efficient organization. This announcement
builds on the momentum in ACS and across the entire portfolio following the
acquisitions of Elster, Xtralis, Intelligrated, and five other acquisitions
since July of last year. The change further positions these businesses to
invest in growth and execute the strategic plans best suited to each portfolio,
and we have the right leaders in place to drive these actions. We expect to
begin reporting under the new segment structure effective with our
third-quarter 2016 results and expect to provide comparative financial
information at that time. So more to come on this in the coming months.

Let's move to slide 11 to discuss the PMT results. PMT sales
declined 4% on a core organic basis, in line with our guidance in what
continues to be a challenging market environment for oil and gas. Our orders
and backlog have remained resilient, and the leadership team has been
unrelenting in its focus to overcome these headwinds. So starting with UOP,
sales were down as expected, driven by lower gas processing, licensing, and
equipment sales. The rate of sales decline improved significantly from the
first quarter. In gas processing, we secured five new domestic wins in the
first half; however that market remains a bit sluggish. On the catalyst side,
overall demand remains strong, and we expect an acceleration of growth in the
second half of the year. UOP orders were modestly higher in the quarter,
including a strong double-digit increase in the catalyst business, and the UOP
backlog was close to 10% higher than the second quarter of 2015.

Process solution continues to outperform its peers in a
challenging environment. We have a unique combination of automation technology,
field instrumentation products, and aftermarket offerings, including software
solutions. Core organic sales increased 8% in the quarter, driven by
double-digit growth in our Projects business and higher Software and Service sales.
Conversion of the global mega-project backlog, where we served as the main
contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations,
remained strong in the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue
throughout the rest of the year. Through the recent mega-project wins, HPS
continues to build out its massive install base, which will benefit our
Services and Aftermarket business in future periods.

Reported sales were higher in the quarter due to the impact
from the Elster acquisition. Advanced Materials sales were down 2% on a core
organic basis, driven by challenging pricing conditions in Resins and
Chemicals, partially offset by continued strong demand, and more than 20%
growth for Solstice Low Global Warming products. We presently have roughly $3.5
billion of signed agreements for Solstice and are building out production
capacity to meet the increased global customer demand.

As expected, PMT segment margins were down 20 basis points
to 21.1%, primarily due to the impact of lower volumes overall and continued
growth investments, partially offset by benefits from previous restructuring
actions and commercial excellence. So overall, market conditions continue to be
tough, but our businesses and PMT are doing well, and we expect an even better
second half.

I'm now on slide 12, with a preview of the third quarter.
You'll note that the guidance reflects the ACS structure prior to this
morning's announcement. We'll be updating the reporting for the new structure
starting in the third quarter, as I mentioned. So for total Honeywell, we're
planning for sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion -- that's up 4% to 6%
reported -- or flat- to- up 1% on a core organic basis. The sales guidance for
the quarter does not reflect the impact of the Intelligrated acquisition, as we
expect the transaction to close near quarter end. Segment margins are expected
to be down 10 basis points to up 10 basis points, excluding M&A; or down 40
basis points to 60 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, EPS is expected
to be in range of $1.67 to $1.72, up 6% to 10%, normalized for income tax at
26.5% in both years.

Starting with Aerospace, sales are expected to be down 1% to
up 1% on a core organic basis. In Commercial Aviation OE, we're expecting sales
to be down double digit, driven by the impact of OEM incentives, and continued
declines in business and general aviation, partially offset by a ramp-up on key
platforms in air transport and regional. Excluding the OEM incentives,
Commercial Aviation OE is expected to be down mid single digit. Commercial
Aviation aftermarket sales are expected to grow mid single digit again, with
strength in both airline and business jet spare sales, including higher Satcom
and other software upgrades. Defense and Space sales are expected to improve
sequentially, but be modestly down on a year-over-year basis, as higher product
sales to the US government are more than offset by challenging prior-year
comparisons in the international business, the impact of large project wind-downs,
and continued softness in US Services.

In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low
single digit, with continued strong growth in light vehicle gas applications,
partially offset by slower growth in diesel, based on the timing of new launches.
As for Aerospace margin rates, we expect to be down 30 to 50 basis points
excluding M&A, driven by higher OEM incentives, the unfavorable impact of
foreign currency, and the unfavorable impact on margin of higher OE shipments
to air transport and regional customers. This will be partially offset by
productivity and commercial excellence.

Moving to ACS, sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a
core organic basis, or up 11% to 12% on a reported basis, driven by
acquisitions. We expect ESS sales growth to be similar to the second quarter on
a core organic basis, led by continued momentum in our Security and Fire
businesses and in our high-growth regions, but more than offset by the declines
we've highlighted in S&PS. In BSD, we're expecting low to mid single-digit
core organic growth, driven primarily by continued strength in Americas
distribution business in both residential and commercial end markets. Excluding
the dilutive impact from M&A, ACS margin rate is expected to improve 90 to
110 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, continued productivity, and
the benefits of restructuring. ACS' reported segment margin rate in the third
quarter is expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points.

In PMT, sales are expected to be flat to up 2% on a core
organic basis, or up 2% to 4% reported. The UOP sales declines are expected to
moderate in the third-quarter, but still be down double digits on a
year-over-year basis, driven primarily by continued declines in licensing
equipment and gas processing, partially offset by strength in the Catalyst
business. Based our growing UOP backlog, we expect the Catalyst sales growth
rates to improve in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth
quarter. HPS sales are expected to be up mid single digits on a core organic
basis, driven by continued conversion of global mega-projects as I mentioned
earlier, as well as higher Software and Service sales.

Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up low to mid
single digits on a core organic basis driven by strength in Flooring products,
Solstice sales, and improving specialty products volumes, benefiting from new
product introductions. PMT reported segment margin rate is expected to be down
100 to 120 basis points and down 70 to 90 basis points, excluding the dilutive
impact of M&A, driven by lower volumes, the unfavorable impact of lower UOP
licensing sales, market pricing headwinds in Resins and Chemicals, and
continued investments for growth, partially offset by productivity net of
inflation.

Slide 13 provides our full-year [2016] expectations by
business, compared to the initial guidance we provided back in December. While
there are a number of puts and takes within the overall portfolio, we're
tracking to what our initial full-year core organic sales guidance for Honeywell.
In Aerospace, Commercial OE continues to see improvement in ATR with a rampup
of key platforms like A350 and A320, as well as Boeing 737 and 787. However, as
we saw this quarter, the demand environment in business jets is slower than we
anticipated, and we expect this trend to continue in the second half.
Meanwhile, our commercial aftermarket business is coming better than
anticipated, as we build on the 6% core organic growth achieved year to date,
driven by stronger flight hours and continued spares growth and repair and
overhaul activities. Defense and Space will remain challenged throughout the
year, as the US Services and Space businesses anticipate further program delays
in the second half, and as oil and gas market declines continue to adversely
impact the commercial helicopter market.

In total, ACS is performing largely as we expected. The
Products businesses are coming in slightly lower, largely due to lower volumes
in our Sensing and Productivity Solutions businesses due to some channel headwinds,
while Building Solutions and Distribution is coming in much better, driven by
double-digit, core organic growth performance in this first quarter and
continued strength in Americas distribution as we move into the second half. In
PMT, our Process Solutions Business continues to outperform, driven by the
strong conversion of the global mega-project backlog. Our Software Solutions
are generating strong demand, and we anticipate this to continue through the
remainder of the year. In UOP, activity continues to be soft, given the
slowdowns in orders and our gas processing, licensing, and equipment
businesses; but as I indicated, we expect a very strong second-half for UOP's
Catalyst business. So on balance, no change to our core organic sales outlook
in total, but we continue to monitor the businesses closely.

I'm moving to slide 14. As Dave mentioned, we're raising the
low end of our full-year EPS guidance by $0.05 with a new range of $6.60 to
$6.70. That's up 8% to 10% from 2015. The new range reflects the outperformance
in the first half of the year. There are some puts and takes among the segments
from the guidance we provided in April, but overall very strong year expected
for Honeywell in 2016 once again.

In total, we now expect core organic sales growth of
approximately 1%, and total sales to be between $40 billion and $40.6 billion,
so up 4% to 5% reported. The revised guidance reflects the incremental
headwinds we've seen in Aerospace, particularly in our BGA and Defense and
Space businesses. This guidance does not reflect the Intelligrated acquisition
or the planned spinoff of Resins and Chemicals. Segment margin expansion is
still expected to be up 10 to 50 basis points, or 80 to 110 basis points,
excluding including the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by commercial
excellence, restructuring benefits, and continued proactive cost management. We
expect the full-year income tax rate to be approximately 26.5%, and our share
count to be approximately 774 million shares, or approximately 2% lower than the
2015 weighted average share count of 789 million. Finally, we continue to
expect free cash flow in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to
10% from 2015, with CapEx investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately
$1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90%
for the full year.

Let me move to slide 15 for a quick summary before turning
it back to Mark for Q&A. We had a solid first half, adding to our strong
performance track record and generating momentum for the rest of the year. Once
again, we've demonstrated that we can deliver at the high end of our aggressive
earnings commitments, even with limited help from the macro environment: a big
reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength
of the Honeywell Operating Systems. And we again put to work a sizable amount
of shareowner capital in the quarter, including $1.5 billion in additional
acquisitions, and $0.5 billion in share repurchases, which will pave the way
for future earnings and cash growth.

The uncertainty in the macro environment is not new for us.
We have and will continue to plan conservatively. We continue to focus on
executing sustainable productivity actions, including delivering on the strong
restructuring pipeline, where we have roughly $300 million of actions to be
carried out. We're making smart bets on innovation and breakthrough initiatives
that continue our investments to further penetrate high-growth regions and
expand capacity. We're in the process of planning for 2017, and our management
team is focused on execution. We feel confident that our balanced portfolio mix
aligned to favorable macro trends and focused cost discipline will continue to
outperform.

DAVE COTE: Are you going to make it, Tom? (laughter)

TOM SZLOSEK: I'm on my last leg here. Without further ado,
let's move to Q&A.

DAVE COTE: If you could please now open the line for
questioning.

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

Scott Davis, Barclays.

DAVE COTE: I hope you don't mind, we just got the EMTs in
here for Tom.

SCOTT DAVIS, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: I was going to say
maybe a shot of whiskey might help out a little bit, or if Cote would give you
a day off once in a while, you might be able to stay healthy. Anyway.

Dave, I love it when management teams use words like strong
2Q with a negative 2% core growth rates, so I am going to call you out a little
bit. The only time we've seen negative core growth at Honeywell, Dave, is when
we've actually been in a recession.

So what's different, what's going on out there that, that
gives you the confidence that we're not walking into an even tougher back half
of the year, because the first half of this year's been pretty tough, and some
of your peers reported pretty tough numbers too, so it's not just you guys. But
negative core growth is something we don't normally see in an expansion time
period, right, so I guess I'm asking a general question on what you think about
the world.

DAVE COTE: I don't think we've ever referred to this
environment as being expansionary, and the way I would describe the overall
performance and why we say strong, if you take a look at the cash we generated,
if you take a look at the operational margin rate improvement of 110 basis
points, which is consistent with what we were doing last year -- it's just all
the stuff to the right of the chart -- was moving in the right direction. This
year, it's not.

If you take a look at the EPS growth, we've been able to
deliver on that. And the chart Tom showed that said about $0.15 or $0.16 of the
total $0.14 increase or $0.15 increase came from operations. That's pretty
strong operational performance.

Now you could say, okay, it is 2% negative core organic,
that's true. It's also consistent with what we had forecasted, was our guidance
range, so it's not like it came as a surprise. And the headwinds are no
different than what we've talked about in the past.

That's why Tom tried to show that 70% of the portfolio is
actually growing 5%. We've just got these unusual headwinds, most of which,
well, all of which dissipate this year. If you take a look at UOP, you know
what's happening on the oil and gas side. And we've always said our diversity
of opportunity will offset that, and we do believe that in 2016, that ends.
This is the bottom for that sector.

If we take a look at Sensing and Productivity Solutions
business, and think of this as a lot driven by Scanning and Mobility, where we
had this huge US Postal Service order last year that were, in terms of a comp,
it's just going to be negative. It just is. It would've been impossible to make
that up.

Our Resins and Chemicals pricing, which you're familiar
with, really has no effect on the bottom line; does affect growth, when we look
at the overall number. And then some in Defense and Space, where there's just
been delays in orders, and the commercial helo market, largely driven by oil
and gas, has been difficult. Those headwinds stop.

It's just a matter of dealing with them as they are today,
and 70% of the portfolio is growing 5%. So I think it's pretty darn good
overall, and yes, I understand the point about minus 2, but we also forecasted
it. It's not like it came as a surprise.

TOM SZLOSEK: The other thing I'd add to that, Dave, is the
Aerospace incentives, which come off the top line as well.

DAVE COTE: Those are significant. The Aerospace incentives
are a huge increase year-to-year, and they show up as a reduction of the sales
and income. And those are about flat year-to-year 2016, 2017 and they decline.
So again, it's a headwind that ends, and isn't a growth headwind for next year
by much.

TOM SZLOSEK: In fact, it helps us. If we're building install
base, and it drives the future service business for that business.

DAVE COTE: So I look at all that - - I feel pretty good
about this, especially in what's not an easy environment.

SCOTT DAVIS: Yes. I get it. If you go back to your guidance
two quarters ago, negative 2 would've been off the table, but yes, I think you
performed about as good as you can do with that kind of growth environment. I'm
not busting your chops on that.

Just lastly, UOP Catalyst coming back, returning in the back
half of the year, and my understanding is it's always been a very high-margin
business. Is this-- is your guidance of little bit conservative on the back
half PMT? Based on that.

DAVE COTE: I mean we'll never say it was conservative; we'll
say that we think it's what were going to achieve but - -

TOM SZLOSEK: As you can --

SCOTT DAVIS: You've got a tailwind there is pretty material,
I would imagine.

TOM SZLOSEK: You appreciate the lumpiness we've had. That
comes with being in that business. But we have very good visibility to the
second half ramp, Scott. In fact, when you look at the third quarter, more than
3/4 of the Catalyst sales that we foresee are in backlog and ready to go, and
in the fourth quarter we're near the same position that we been in the past, in
terms of the percentage of backlog that we have.

So there's a little bit more wood to chop for the fourth
quarter, but we have good line of sight and good visibility, and yes there is a
step- up but, the team is confident in being able to execute on it.

SCOTT DAVIS: Got it. Okay. Good luck, guys. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Andrew Obin, Bank of America.

ANDREW OBIN, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Just a question on
Aerospace. There's a headline that American Airlines is deferring their 22
A350s. And if you looked at the press, at the local press in Arizona, it was
writing about big layoffs and furloughs in your Aerospace business back in May.

I understand that a lot of the stuff was temporary, but can
you just talk more about the Aerospace cycle, why such big, sort of unusual
furloughs in the Aerospace business. Are you worried about the direction of the
commercial Aerospace cycle? Just connect the dots for us. Thank you.

DAVE COTE: On the volume side, ATR actually feels fine. The
biz jet industry is struggling a little bit, and we expect that will continue.
That will be offset by all the new platforms we've been on. When you look at
the layoffs and furloughs that you're referencing, a lot of that is being
driven by just better and better efficiency within our Aerospace business.

Tim has been doing a remarkable job of just making all our
processes work better, whether it's how we engineer, how we manufacture, how we
run our staff functions. It's really just being driven by doing a better job
overall, which is a good sign. That certainly puts us in a much better position
to grow.

ANDREW OBIN: And just a follow-up on Defense and Space.
International orders was supposed to be a big area of growth, you talk about
deferrals. How much visibility do you have into 2017 and 2018 on these delays?
Thank you.

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, I mean, the backlogs are holding up. As
far as Defense and Space goes, the challenges for us were more in, I'd say, the
commercial helicopter market, and a lot of the other defense companies that
have commercial helicopter businesses separate those out. We've got ours right
in the Defense segment. With the number of used aircraft available, as well as
the declines in the drilling activity, you've seen a reduction in spare parts
and services, and that is impacting our portfolio there.

Your guess is as good as ours in terms of where oil prices
are going and when the volumes will turn, but we feel pretty confident that
we're at or close to bottom in UOP, and we expect that to kind of prevail
through the rest of our portfolio as well. So we expect to see this improve.

The technology that we have in commercial helos is
outstanding, top-notch, and we serve all the big helicopter manufacturers and
have a very strong aftermarket business as well. So it should turn for us,
Andy.

ANDREW OBIN: Thank you, and I'll echo Scott's remarks on
good performance in tough markets. Thank you.

DAVE COTE: Thank you. We appreciate it, Andrew.

OPERATOR: Steve Tusa, J.P. Morgan.

STEVE TUSA, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Can you just talk about the
moving parts with a little more detail on ACS in the second half? Maybe just
give us a little bit of color? It looks like, obviously, pretty back-end
loaded. You know type of trajectory, and I guess there's some acquisition snap
back in there. Maybe just to give us some color there.

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, I mean when you look at the second half
for - - if you look at the third quarter for ACS, we're calling flat to minus,
or sorry, at flat to up 1% fourth-quarter, in that same region, down 1% to
flat. So it's a little bit more conservative, actually, than what we've seen
quarter- to- date. We had a very strong first quarter, as you remember Steve,
up by think 5% or 6%.

A little more modest in the second quarter, so I think we've
actually built the second half fairly conservatively in ACS. We'll get some
improvement in S&PS, particularly in the fourth quarter, to help us get
that growth rate.

STEVE TUSA: What are the margins in the acquisitions going
to do specifically? I know you guys were they were very low single digits, in
the big bucket of deal, they were very low single digits in kind of the first
half here. What you expect out of those in the second half?

DAVE COTE: I mean you saw the dilution in the margin rate
overall for ACS, it was on order of 50 basis points to 70 basis points. That
will moderate as we get into the third quarter and fourth quarter. So overall,
it'll be a margin improvement for us, and by the time we get to the
fourth-quarter, we'll have very strong, 100 basis points- type conversion in
ACS, or 100 basis points improvement in ACS on an organic basis.

STEVE TUSA: Then one last question, just on the-- Dave, he
talked about at the Investor the 4% to 5% or whatever it was revenue guidance
for next year. How did that stand today? How do you feel about that today after
reducing the expectation for the second half?

DAVE COTE: Well, the conditions that generate a 4% to 5%
increase are still there. We'll see what the numbers actually look like as we
get on further through the year, but all the basics are still there. When you
take a look at Aerospace, it's still a case where you don't have this big
increase in incentives that hurt you on the growth side year- to- year.

The biz jet applications even in a tougher market still help
you. UOP does bottom out this year. Some of the CapEx expansions that we were
talking about in PMT are still there for us next year-- are still there for us
next year, when you look at fluorine's in particular, and what we've been able
to achieve with some of the acquisitions.

When you look at ACS, we still expect that to be a good
performer for us again next year, although, of course, split into two pieces.
So the conditions are all still there. What the macro environment looks like as
we get into that year, I guess we'll have to assess as it moves on, but all the
conditions that we talked about are still present.

STEVE TUSA: Okay. Thanks a lot.

OPERATOR: Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley.

NIGEL COE, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: I hope, Tom, you've
recovered from your seizure.

DAVE COTE: The EMT's got him on the machine; he's doing fine
now.

NIGEL COE: Oh, that's what I can hear the background, okay,
good. Obviously, the trends in UOP backlog have been really encouraging. I
think you mentioned 10% growth in the backlog year- over- year. You're also
calling for an inflection second-half on Catalysts.

Just wondering how much of that backlog right now speaks to
2017 and does it allow you to make any judgments about 2017. I hear the
comments about UOP troughing this year, but I'm just wondering if the backlogs
speaks to 2017 in any informed way.

TOM SZLOSEK: To me the visibility is stronger, obviously,
Nigel, for the second half of the year. But in terms of our planning for 2017,
we certainly are expecting significant improvement overall in UOP on the
equipment site as well as in Catalyst. Remember, we were down 35% in the first
quarter, and something like 17% to 18% this quarter. That's going to start to
improve in the second half with that building of the backlog.

You know, the team is very confident, in terms of both the
second half and their ability to generate orders to support 2017. Full
visibility of the full-year obviously isn't there, but in terms of what the
leaders in the business see, and we just went through the five-year planning
exercise, which had a heavy focus on the earlier years. There is optimism in
terms of what the market conditions are going to hold for us in 2017.

DAVE COTE: Just building on that, just the absence of a
decline will be a significant benefit.

NIGEL COE: All right. Yes, I absolutely agree with that.

DAVE COTE: The decline has been pretty significant.

NIGEL COE: I mean that chart showing the divergence between
the portfolio is really helpful. A quick one on the ACS re-segmentation. With
Alex leaving, and the re-segmentation, what does that mean for the Connected
ACS initiative? Is it the same initiative, just in two pieces now? And do you
think that both of those segments can be 20%- plus margin segments?

DAVE COTE: I didn't quite get the last part of that, Nigel.

NIGEL COE: You talked about ACS being a 20%- type margin. Do
think both of those can be 20%?

DAVE COTE: Starting with the last one first. We'll have to
see how that plays out on the Homes and Building side, because now all
Distribution and Building Solutions business are in there, and they tend to be
lower margin. So haven't gotten far enough on that one yet to be able to say
that can be 20%. But the overall putting the two together. Yes. That can still
get to 20%. So how that will shake out by business will take some time for us
to sort out.

On the connected ACS, yes. That potential is still there.
And will continue to be there. It's just going to be into two pieces, so think
of it as connected Homes and Buildings technologies, and connected Safety and
Productivity solutions. That's still going to exist.

There's just terrific opportunity for us in these two more
focused enterprises, so think of it as one is more Commercial and Industrial,
and the other is Homes and Buildings. It just allows us to be a lot closer to
our markets than we have in the past, with that same connected ACS approach.
Which I think is going to really speak well for us and allow us to do a lot
better in those markets that we even have in the past.

NIGEL COE: Okay, that's great. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Steven Winoker, Bernstein.

STEVEN WINOKER, ANALYST, BERNSTEIN: Dave, that Intelligrated
acquisition is great, but you know thinking about the $25 billion or so you
talk about in M&A, should we expect more like that now, and how are you
looking at the pipeline? What are your thoughts on M&A playing out from
here?

DAVE COTE: Well, the story doesn't really change from
anything we said in the past, Steve, that we've got a lot of money to deploy.
And that give us a lot of flexibility, and you've seen us do it in different
ways: M&A, repurchases, and we thought it made sense. And M&A pipeline
still looks really good.

We have at least 100 companies we're looking at any one
point in time, from small ones to big ones. Tough to predict when they're going
to become available, or when we can do something. And it's not like it comes in
a steady dose. Sometimes you get three or four right away, sometimes you go a
year and a half, two years with not much of anything.

I can just promise you it's top of mind for all of us, and
we've got a pretty strong, good effort working on it to constantly look for
stuff that will make sense and to generate returns for our, good returns for
our shareowners. We're still - - money's not burning a hole in our pocket; it
never will. It's important for us to be smart about how we deploy that money.
In the meantime, we're going to focus on making sure we generate a lot of it. And
this quarter was a nice indication of that.

STEVEN WINOKER: Okay, great. And how do you see the
construction cycle playing out and risk to that, in I guess I'll call it HBT
now.

DAVE COTE: Construction cycle still looks fine, whether it's
commercial or residential, it still looks okay. It's not like it's a boom. But
by the same token, it still seems to be coming back pretty steady. Tom, I don't
- -

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, I guess I would say that in ACS, that was
the strongest vertical force in the quarter, it has been for the last couple
years. Mid- single- digit growth at least in the businesses that serve the
commercial segments.

STEVEN WINOKER: That's baked into your 2017 assumption that
continues right? That 4% to 5% you've talked about?

TOM SZLOSEK: For the most part.

DAVE COTE: Pretty much. We've pretty much assumed that
continues, just the way it is, so slow, steady growth, not a boom, but not a
decline, either.

STEVEN WINOKER: If I could just one more. Dave, with the
announcement for Darius, and you're not exactly hands-off. What you plan to
focus on as executive chairman versus CEO, once we get past that March? How
should we think about the role that is effectively a new role, and still a
transition, I'm sure, over that following year for you?

DAVE COTE: Well, I've built a special closet to keep Darius
in the entire time. This is part - - I think if you take a look at our history,
when it comes to transitions and how we do things, I think we tend to do things
pretty well and think them through. And, yes, I am very hands-on. Darius is
very hands-on. He wouldn't have gotten the job unless he was.

He's an independent thinker. He's going to be important for
the evolution of the Company. And yes, it's going to be important for me to
recognize the difference between my job and Darius'. We get along really well,
or at least at this point, Darius says we get along really well. So it feels
that way.

But at the end of the day, I don't foresee a real issue
doing this. We can manage it, and we want a great transition, because I still
own a lot of shares. Darius owns a lot of shares. We want this thing to work
well. I don't foresee it being a real issue.

STEVEN WINOKER: No, I didn't think there was an issue, it's
more just about what do you see doing in the role than anything?

DAVE COTE: It'll be more advisory than anything else,
because there has to be one guy running the place. Otherwise it's just chaos.
And until March 31, I run it. Starting in April, Darius runs it. And that's
going to be-- we've made that very clear to everybody around here.

STEVEN WINOKER: Okay. Perfect. Thanks, a lot guys.

OPERATOR: John Inch, Deutsche Bank.

JOHN INCH, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Tom, in the deferred
fourth quarter, as part of your third-quarter walk, I know the first quarter
you had some extra selling days, and I realize you're not like a daily sales-
type of company, but it does come out of the fourth quarter, does that have any
sort of discernible bearing, I guess, on growth in the quarter or anything
else?

TOM SZLOSEK: I would say it's reflected in the full-year
guidance that we've given. We fully contemplated those factors, John.

JOHN INCH: Okay. So there's nothing discernible. I didn't
think there would be, but I just wanted to double- check.

David, I want to pick up on Steve Winoker's question. You
know, you had a incredible run, and I guess many of us sort of thought that you
would be sticking around a little bit longer, and so now you're sort of doing a
big ACS restructuring, which I understand the logic; it all seems pretty positive.

What is sort of the implications of perhaps you leaving or
stepping aside a little bit sooner? Is it that there's a lot of, say, growth
initiatives the Company has been looking to do, and that you sort of decided
that maybe Darius should be assuming this on his own? Or perhaps there's
M&A implications, or I'm just curious it's almost a personal question, if
there's something you could share with us.

DAVE COTE: You mean am I running out of gas so I need a
younger guy to keep the level of the Company up? (laughter)

JOHN INCH: We're all running out of gas, but I didn't mean
it that way. It's more the implication of strategic initiatives for the
Corporation and next steps and all that sort of stuff.

DAVE COTE: You shouldn't be reading any big implications into
any of this. This is just a case where I am 64. At some point investors start
to look at it and say, hey, we like you, Dave, but like what's next year, and
how we make sure this continues?

We've got a really good guy in Darius and he's ready now.
There's no reason to wait. And better off, you know, like Belichick I guess
would say, better leave a year too early than a year too late, and I think it's
important to get the timing right. We agree on the initiatives that we want for
the Company. We both agree on the need to outperform and how do we do that.

I think if you were to talk to Darius, he'd talk about the
need for HOS Gold and the breakthrough initiatives, the need to develop our
software capability even further. What we're doing in high-growth regions ends
up continuing to be important. All that being said, all this stuff is going to
evolve.

It's never a case-- I've never felt that way, where a
strategy was permanently correct. Rather, you needed to keep adjusting, you
needed to keep evolving, whether you were a person, a company, a country,
you've got to keep evolving. And we've done a lot of evolving over15 years, and
I think you can expect Darius to keep it evolving for the next 15.

JOHN INCH: I appreciate the comments, Dave, thanks very
much.

OPERATOR: Howard Rubel, Jefferies.

HOWARD RUBEL, ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC: I have two questions.
Dave, you've done a nice job over time, and in ACS with doing a lot of product
line extensions, or what I'll call business extensions. How do you think
about-- I mean I know with this separation of the two companies, how do you
think about where you go from here with the opportunities?

DAVE COTE: I think both are going to be extremely good. And
you take a look at what's possible in the Homes and Buildings sector, especially
with our installed base and the increasing need for software- capable products
and services. It's quite entrancing with what can happen there. And having a
more intense focus on it, I think is going to be very good for us.

On the commercial and industrial side with John Waldron,
we're going to see the exact same thing, and the push that we've made with
Intelligrated is going to help greatly there. Warehouse space we feel is going
to be tremendous for a long time to come, especially with development of the
e-economy, and that's going to play very well for us, especially as you look at
what we do with barcode scanning and how that fits. I'm really quite entranced
with what can happen there.

HOWARD RUBEL: You bring a little bit of-- I mean, I guess
you've said before, sort of the power of a big company, but the challenge of
being an entrepreneurial one at the same time.

DAVE COTE: That's exactly the point of HOS Gold, and what
we're trying to do. You combine that with the breakthrough goals that Darius has
been a big supporter of, and I think has improved significantly, just in the
three months that he's been doing this. Puts us in really good position.
There's a lot of good for us to come out of the two businesses.

HOWARD RUBEL: To turn to Aerospace and growth for a moment.
You have a fairly substantial connectivity initiative, and also there's a
fairly significant change in the avionics market with the demand for ADSB.
Could you first for a moment talk about the progress you've made with the
connectivity initiative, and then again it looks like the pent-up demand for
ADSB remains, and at some point, how are you going to convert that into
satisfying it?

DAVE COTE: Yes, on the connectivity side, things are going
very well there. This really is a far superior product. The thing that's been
going on right now is while it exists, every airframer needs to get it
certified, so that it can be put on the aircraft. Demand is very good. We just
need to be able to get the certifications done with the airframers so that we
can get it out there.

I'm pretty well convinced that when consumers actually start
to feel the difference between existing services and what we're able to provide
with JetWave, they're going to be quite impressed, and it is going to get to a
point where consumers ask for it, and it's going to be a differentiating item
for airlines. For their consumers.

Interestingly, some of the surveys that have been done show
that on a three-hour flight or less, passengers prefer strong Wi-Fi to access
to a bathroom. Quite significant when you look at it that way. So we're really
hot on what this connectivity initiative is going to be able to do for us. And
on ADSB, it's typical with any mandate, is that it seems to all be back-end
loaded as customers wait, and we'll be prepared for it.

HOWARD RUBEL: Thank you very much.

OPERATOR: Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs.

JOE RITCHIE, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: I think I'll shoot with
and go for the bathroom instead of the Wi-Fi but - -

DAVE COTE: Just don't sit next to somebody who chose Wi-Fi.

JOE RITCHIE: Exactly. Maybe just a broader question, Dave,
we've been spoiled for so long in the quarters you guys have just continued to
beat on the segment EBIT line. And recently, really, the last couple quarters
you just in digesting a lot, whether it's UTX, the leadership transition,
M& A.

How do you respond to maybe some of the concerns that are
out there right now, that perhaps like management capacity has been strapped,
the focus hasn't been as rigid as it had been historically? Maybe some thoughts
around that would be helpful.

DAVE COTE: Guess I think this is one where you have to look
at the record, and for simplicity, just compare last year to this year. Sales
growth was tough last year, also. It was a difficult environment last year. And
we kept breaking out the margin rate improvement chart to show here's the
operational stuff. And here's all the other stuff that just goes on top of it,
and focus on the operational piece, because the rest of this stuff can
disappear.

Well, this year, it's just gone the other way. The
operational improvement is still pretty darn good. And consistent with last
year. And if you look over on the right-hand side, in this continued slow
growth environment just like last year, it's just going the other way, is all.
But at the end of the day, the operational performance continues to be very
good in a slow- growth environment.

That part is not changing, and we are the same Company that
we were before, and what we're trying to do is just highlight these kind of swing
items and say don't focus on these. We're not asking for credit when it goes
our way, and you shouldn't be dinging us when it goes the other way, because
the fundamentals of the Company are still there, are still good and portends
for a very good future for Honeywell shareowners.

TOM SZLOSEK: Joe, I would add to that, and I would say that
in addition to the operational improvement that's in the triple digits, I mean
when you look at the items that brought us back to a recorded margin rate that
was lower than that 110 basis points, there are either items that will turn for
us, or that are of an investment nature. So, for example, if you look at
foreign exchange, we're going from a FX rate of $1.24 last year to $1.10 this
quarter. I talked about 2017 and some of the hedging we've done, so that will
be an actual in our tails next year.

When I look at the OEM incentives that we're making. This
was the year that we've always flagged as having to deal with over $200 million
of P&L impact from the increased incentives. Those level off next year, and
actually help us to build an installed base for service opportunities, and in
the longer- term, those decrease. So it'll be another tailwind for us.

Then third, you've got a lot of M&A going on. We've done
eight acquisitions in the last year. There was a lot of focus on that, but when
you're doing acquisitions, especially the size and the ones that we've done,
you do get some headwinds in the earlier quarters, from the purchase accounting
step- up, the integration team cost, and the like. And those will all turn for
us as well and really be a nice margin driver for us in the future.

We're really happy with the acquisitions, and as I said, we
don't include the organic growth that we're experiencing in those acquisitions
in the minus 2% organic growth rate that we talk about, but those acquisitions
grew 8% to 9% on their own if you compared how they did under prior ownership
to how they did with Honeywell. So pretty strong performance. So we're really
actually excited about these various factors, because they're going to turn and
have a positive influence for next year.

DAVE COTE: Couldn't agree more.

JOE RITCHIE: Sounds good. Thanks, guys.

OPERATOR: That concludes today's question-and-answer
session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Dave
Cote for any additional or closing remarks.

DAVE COTE: In a difficult environment, we continue to
outperform for our investors. That's not going to change. The fundamentals for
us remain as good as you saw in this quarter, with our performance and our
confidence in again raising our guidance for the year, this time to 8% to 10%
growth. Rest assured, we're going to continue to deliver. And we hope you all
get to enjoy a great summer. Thanks.

OPERATOR: Thank you. This does conclude today's
teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful
day.

Presentation

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to
Honeywell's first-quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

(Operator Instructions)

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I
would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mark Macaluso,
Vice President of Investor Relations.

MARK MACALUSO, VP OF IR, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.:
Thanks, Cynthia. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's first-quarter 2016
earnings conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote,
and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Szlosek.

This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP
reconciliations, are available on our website at 

. Note that elements of this
presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view
of the world and of our businesses as you see them today, so those elements can
change and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal
risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other
SEC filings.

This morning, we will review our financial results for the
first quarter and share with you our guidance for the second quarter and full
year of 2016 and finally, as always, we will leave time for your questions at
the end.

So with that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO,
Dave Cote.

DAVID COTE, CHAIRMAN & CEO, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL
INC.: Good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell
delivered another strong quarter to kickoff 2016. EPS of $1.53 increased 9%
coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Sales of $9.5 billion were up
1% on a core organic basis, above the high end of our sales guidance.

We outperformed and saw growth accelerate in: Aerospace,
Commercial Aftermarket and Transportation Systems; and in our residential and
commercial and China businesses within ACS; and in Process Solutions and
Fluorine Products in PMT. Excluding the dilutive impact of M&A segment margin
expanded 20 basis points in the quarter to 18.9%.

We generated significant sustainable productivity in the
quarter. The Honeywell user experience is driving new products at higher
margins. Our factories and sourcing organizations continue to mature and we continue
to re-engineer our products to make them easier and less expensive to
manufacture.

HOS Gold and our key process initiatives that generated
their productivity allowed us to overcome previously discussed significant
headwinds in segment profit. These included over $40 million of additional
Aerospace OEM incentives, additional depreciation stemming from our ramp-up in
high ROI CapEx, the strengthening of the US dollar, and difficult comparisons
at UOP and Sensing & Productivity Solutions which Tom will take you through
further.

Our segment margin rate was slightly lower than our guidance
range, primarily due to a combination of higher-than-expected sales of lower
margin products like in BSD and commercial aviation OE and lower sales of
higher margin products like in ESS and UOP catalyst. We still expect to be
within our segment margin guidance range for the full year, as sales growth
modestly improves in the second half of the year, basically just from the
absence of declines in UOP that we encounter in the first half.

We will, of course, continue with our disciplined cost
controls, focus on commercial excellence and execution of previously funded
restructuring actions. Our strong start and the momentum we see in parts of the
portfolio allow us to raise the low end of our 2016 full-year earnings guidance
to a new range of $6.55 to $6.70.

We're up 7% to 10% year over year. Our planning framework
has not changed. We will support growth wherever we have it to drive out
performance. We will be cautious in our sales planning. We will continue to
plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a
Company. And we will maintain our seed planting investments for the future,
supported by our robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects and continued
investments in R&D. In the second quarter, we expect EPS growth of 7% to
10%, in line with the full-year range.

There's a number of exciting things that are happening
across the Company and I'd like to spend a moment on them here. Earlier this
month, we appointed Darius Adamczyk to the newly created role of President and
Chief Operating Officer reporting to me. In this role, he will drive continued
profitable growth of our operating businesses through HOS Gold breakthrough
strategies and advanced software offerings that complement Honeywell's diverse
technology portfolio.

Honeywell remained very active on the capital allocation
front in the first quarter. We opportunistically repurchased over $1 billion of
Honeywell shares at a weighted average price of approximately $104 and we
deployed another $1 billion to acquisitions.

We announced and closed three deals in ACS: Xtralis and RSI
Video Technologies in security and fire, and Movilizer in Sensing &
Productivity Solutions. And as we discussed in January, we acquired the
remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell, a global leader in modular gas processing
technology and equipment. Each acquisition brings differentiated technology and
a software focus to drive new growth and greater profitability while building
on our great positions in good industries.

Our acquisitions across the portfolio last year to bolster
our connectivity and software offerings are already paying dividends, with new
wins announced by Elster, Aviaso, and COM DEV. Enexis, one of the largest
multi-utility distribution system operators in the Netherlands, selected
Honeywell Elster to deliver more than one million smart electricity meters over
the next five years as part of the country's efforts to meet the European Union
energy efficiency goals.

Aerospace's Aviaso business was selected by Etihad Airways
to provide fuel efficiency software and analysis to undercover opportunities
for fuel savings and measure the effectiveness of fuel efficiency initiatives
already in place. COM DEV, part of defense and space in Aero, recently
announced the launch of our world-leading ferrite technology on the European
Space Agency's Sentinel-3A satellite.

Our systems enable fast, reliable connectivity to provide
near real-time data from the satellite's measurement systems. We continue to be
excited about the growth opportunities these businesses bring to Honeywell and
look forward to telling you more about our progress.

Some of you may have seen last month that Honeywell Green
Jet Fuel is now being used by United Airlines to power 12,500 flights from LA
to San Francisco as part of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions and support
energy diversification. Honeywell Green Jet Fuel can replace as much as 50% of
petroleum-derived jet fuel used in flight without any changes to the aircraft
technology while meeting the current ASTM Jet Fuel Specs for flight.

Depending on the bio-feed stock, Honeywell Green Jet Fuel
can offer a 65% to 85% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with
petroleum-based fuels. We have lots of exciting new innovations and initiatives
driving growth and margin expansion across the portfolio. Our big wins,
capacity expansions, and software and connectivity focus drive significant
growth.

We've got a lot of momentum across the portfolio. Innovation
and execution, our seed planting for the future, great positions in good
industries, and the power of One Honeywell continue to be differentiators.

So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.

TOM SZLOSEK, SVP & CFO, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: Thanks,
Dave. Good morning. I'm on slide 3 which shows the first-quarter results, so
sales of $9.5 billion increased 1% on a core organic basis. Each of the
segments exceeded the sales guidance we provided in January, led by Commercial
Aviation, Building Solutions & Distribution, and Process Solutions, which
I'll talk more about on the business slides.

By region, core organic sales modestly declined in the
Americas and increased high single digit in Europe. In our high-growth regions,
India grew double digit while in China, Aero and ACS increased double digit,
partially offset by declines in PMT. On a reported basis, total sales increased
3%, as acquisitions more than offset the unfavorable impact of the stronger US
dollar and lower pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals.

Segment margin was down 60 basis points versus the prior
year but up 20 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. The
businesses are driving benefits from HOS Gold, our focus on commercial
excellence, new product development and functional transformation while
maintaining our investments for growth. I'll talk more about the segment margin
in a minute.

Earnings per share of $1.53 was up 9%, coming in at the high
end of our guidance range. Items below segment profit were favorable on a
year-over-year basis. Consistent with our long-term framework, we recorded
approximately $40 million of new restructuring projects, partially offsetting
the benefit from higher pension income.

For the full year, we anticipate that additional
restructuring charges will largely offset the incremental pension income,
positioning us well for margin expansion. Non-controlling interest was also
favorable year over year, as anticipated, given the purchase of the remaining
30% stake in UOP Russell.

On share count, as Dave mentioned, we repurchased over $1
billion of shares at attractive prices, which brought our weighted average
fully diluted share count to approximately 777 million for the quarter. We have
been and will continue to be opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases
and deploy capital to opportunities that will create the greatest value for our
shareowners.

Free cash flow in the quarter of $63 million was down from
the first quarter of 2015, driven primarily by the timing of tax payments and
higher capital expenditures, offset by better working capital performance.
Capital expenditures of almost $200 million in the quarter increased 18% year
over year.

The first quarter has historically proven to be our lowest
from a cash perspective and we will remain on track to our full-year cash
guidance of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion. Overall, we continue to generate
strong results in a relatively low-growth environment.

I'm now on slide 4 to provide more detail on our segment
margin expansion. Our operating initiatives continued to drive segment margin
growth, led by the deployment of HOS Gold. We generated an 80 basis point
operational improvement in the quarter, which compares well with 100-plus basis
point improvement for the full-year 2015.

We have differentiated technologies on the software focus.
Our supply chains are becoming more lean, our back office continues to get more
efficient, and there's strong collaboration across the organizations to drive
down our material costs and indirect spend. The previously funded restructuring
as well as new restructuring actions have enabled us to continue improving our
overall cost position.

We were encouraged by the outperformance on the top line in
Building Solutions & Distribution and in our Commercial Aviation OE
businesses this quarter, but that overdrive as well as the lower UOP
petrochemical catalyst sales and lower-than-expected products growth in ACS
Scanning & Productivity Solutions business constrained the operational
margin improvement to the 80 basis points that you see.

Lower raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins &
Chemicals added 10 basis points. The impact from the pricing dynamics in Resins
& Chemicals should be minimal for all of 2016. The other three impacts you
see on the slide combined for 150 basis points of margin contraction in the
quarter.

First, M&A accounted for 80 basis points primarily due
to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go costs. The incremental amortization
from the deals will be a margin headwind for the rest of the year, as
anticipated. We're in the midst of integrating eight acquisitions and are happy
to report that each one is performing well and is ahead of our deal financial
model.

Second as we previewed in our December outlook call,
Aerospace OEM incentives increased by approximately $44 million from 2015,
reflecting our continued investment in developing and growing our install base
on the right platforms in the commercial aviation industry. Depending on their
nature, the incentives are treated as a reduction to revenue or as a cost but
either way, they reduce segment profit as they are incurred.

Third, on foreign exchange, as previewed, the strengthening
of the US dollar drove down our margins principally in Transportation Systems.
You'll recall that we were able to hedge our euro earnings at approximately
$1.24 in 2015 versus our 2016 euro hedge rate of $1.10.

So put it into perspective, these three items accounted for
approximately $63 million of headwind in the quarter, or roughly $0.06 of
earnings per share. In that light, the $0.12 of earnings per share growth for
the first quarter certainly stands out.

I'm now on slide 5. Summarizing our first-quarter segment
margin performance versus guidance. We are up 30 basis points at the midpoint.
This chart provides some color on that. Aero and PMT were generally in line
with what we guided. In Aero, we continued to drive strong productivity
improvements but we did see some impact from the higher-than-planned Commercial
OE content.

In PMT, we hit the high end of the guidance range. In ACS,
we experienced the sales shift, that is lower-than-anticipated ESS sales,
including a double-digit decline in Scanning & Productivity Solutions, but
higher-than-expected sales in Building Solutions & Distribution. The adverse
margin impact of these sales shifts offsets the continued improvements we're
seeing across the ACS portfolio from productivity initiatives, commercial
excellence and restructuring.

As you'll see later, we continue to maintain our full-year
margin guidance, which includes an acceleration of restructuring benefits in
the second half of the year. This, while absorbing the adverse margin impacts
of the M&A accounting, the Aerospace OEM incentives and the strengthening
of the US dollar.

Let's turn to slide 6 with a quick update on some of our
recent acquisitions. In 2015, we announced five acquisitions, aggregating over
$5.5 billion in purchase price. These were across all of our SBGs, following
our consistent qualitative and quantitative methodologies. We've continued this
into 2016, having already announced and closed the three additional deals
highlighted on this page. Each of these deals allows us to put non-US cash to
work and each advances the software content in the Honeywell portfolio.

Starting with Xtralis and RSI Video Technologies, each of
these acquisitions has excellent technologies, including video analytics and
software that complement and expand our current security and fire offerings.

Xtralis is a pioneer in very early warning smoke detection
technology, which enables customers to protect high-value assets, such as
museums and historical buildings or facilities where continuity is critical,
such as IT data centers and warehouses. Xtralis is the clear leader in that
space.

RSI's advanced motion technology allows our commercial and
residential customers to receive intrusion alerts through a live video stream
over the cloud, providing visual verification that an intrusion event has
indeed occurred. This verification is legislatively mandated throughout Europe
as a means of reducing unnecessary police response to false alarms and we
expect this type of legislation will become more prevalent globally.

Movilizer allows us to expand our offerings for the
connected worker in Sensing & Productivity Solutions. Movilizer's cloud
platform plugs seamlessly into our customers' ERP systems and enables them to
develop, deploy and manage their work flow and field-service operations through
the Movilizer app. Each of these 2016 acquisitions are being integrated into
Honeywell right now and each is tracking ahead of our financial deal model.

Let's move to slide 7 and discuss the Aerospace results.
Sales were up 3% on a core organic basis and above our expectations, driven by
better-than-expected growth in the Commercial Aviation business. Aerospace
recently created one unified commercial strategic business unit named
Commercial Aviation.

This organization combines our Business and General Aviation
and our Air Transport and Regional business units to provide the consistent and
world class support required to win and grow our OEM and Aftermarket business.

Commercial Aviation OE sales increased by 4% on a core
organic basis, driven by continued strong engine shipments and increased
JetWave Satcom sales in Business and General Aviation, and higher sales to OEMs
and Air Transport and Regional, partially offset by a 6 point headwind from the
higher OEM incentives that I previously mentioned. As we mentioned in January,
the growth in BGA OE is driven by our HTF7000 series engine, which has won four
of the five super mid-size business jet platforms.

Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales were up 6% on a core
organic basis driven by better-than-expected ATR flight hours and double-digit
growth in repair and overhaul activities. On the spare side, we saw an increase
in airline spares, partially offset by lower spare sales in other parts of BGA
through the timing of channel provisioning. In China, both spares and R&O
sales increased double digit on strong flight hours.

Defense & Space sales declined 2% on a core organic
basis, driven by program delays and project timing in our US service
businesses. International business, in particular, faced a difficult prior
comparison as larger projects were completed. And as a reminder, the international
defense business grew north of 20% in the first quarter of 2015.

Additionally, we closed the COM DEV acquisition, that's the
satellite communications business we bought in February, and that integration
is progressing nicely. Transportation Systems sales increased 6% on a core
organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both
gas and diesel light-vehicle applications.

On the gas side, we saw double-digit growth in both Europe
and China. On a reported basis, TS sales increased 3%, reflecting the stronger
US dollar. Aerospace segment margin expanded 70 basis points or 90 basis
points, excluding a dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by
productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence, partially offset by continued
investments for growth, including the higher OEM incentives.

Let's turn to the ACS results on slide 8. ACS sales were up
4% on a core organic basis in the first quarter, above the high end of our
guidance. ACS continues to outperform in high-growth regions. Sales in both
China and India grew double digit in the quarter, driven by our connected ACS
strategy and the benefits from our ongoing investments for growth.

Sales in Energy, Safety & Security so the products
businesses were flat on a core organic basis in the first quarter and include a
negative 3 point impact from the 2015 completion of the US Postal Services
contract in Sensing & Productivity Solutions. Excluding Sensing &
Productivity Solutions, the other three business units within ESS were up this
quarter on an average of 3%.

The momentum continued in security and fire globally, with
the strong growth rates in both residential and commercial markets, coupled
with the benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in
high-growth regions. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth
quarter.

Building Solutions & Distribution sales were up 11% on a
core organic basis outpacing our expectations. We continue to see strength in
the Americas Distribution business, where sales increased over 15% on both the
residential and commercial sides and growth has improved sequentially every
quarter since the beginning of 2015.

In Building Solutions, sales grew mid single digit,
reflecting strength in both project installation and service businesses. Orders
growth was also healthy, approaching 20%, with particular strength in the
services and energy retrofit businesses. We're encouraged by the solid
improvement we have seen in our energy portfolio in HBS this quarter.

Our selections, so where we have chosen in an RFP but have
not yet booked the order, those selections stand at nearly $500 million and
have been growing steadily over the past 18 months. In the past, I've described
the slow pace of the conversion of this selection pool into orders. Well, we
are starting to see some of the acceleration of that conversion.

Energy orders were up over 350% in the first quarter and we
expect orders growth north of 25% in the second quarter and for the full year,
energy orders should nearly double. This has been driven by sales, excellence
and a differentiated offering that is leading to multiple awards in an industry
that is expected to grow at strong, mid single digits over the next five years.

We're also seeing traction in the service business in HBS, driven
by focused investments in NPI. Overall, the HBS backlog increased mid single
digit on an organic basis, driven primarily by growth in Europe and Asia
Pacific, and the conversion of backlog is improving. We converted on a number
of larger projections in high-growth regions, particularly in India.

The ACS margin rate contracted 140 basis points in the
quarter but was up 10 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of
acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, the margin expansion was below our
expectations, primarily driven by higher project installation and distribution
sales which carry lower margins.

ACS continues to benefit from commercial excellence,
productivity initiatives, and the impacts from restructuring. We continue to
invest for growth in our connected product offerings and in high-growth region
sales, marketing and engineering resources. As an example, we've received great
feedback thus far on our second generation of Lyric products, including our
Water Leak and Freeze Detector products, following our launch in April.

I'm now on slide 9 with the PMT results. Sales in the
quarter were better than expected, primarily driven by strength in Process
Solutions and Business that continues to outperform its peers in a challenging
environment. Process Solutions sales grew 9% on a core organic basis, driven by
double-digit growth in our Process businesses and by higher services sales.

Conversion of the Global Mega Project wins in backlog, where
we serve as the main contractor, providing Control and Safety solutions for
large installations, picked up in the first quarter and we expect this trend to
continue throughout 2016. Orders were down low single digits on a core organic
basis, but improved in our higher margin software and service businesses.

In particular, we see increased demand for our Assurance 360
service partnership offering, which is a multi-year agreement to maintain,
support and optimize the performance of Honeywell process control systems. And
UOP sales were down, as expected, driven by lower gas processing, catalyst and
equipment sales. Gas processing faced tough prior-year comparisons in the first
quarter and while the domestic gas processing environment remains muted,
international activity continues to be encouraging.

Catalyst demand, overall, remains strong but it's not
unusual to see variations from quarter to quarter as we've highlighted in the
past. The first-quarter declines were consistent with this trend, following
strong catalyst shipments in 2015. UOP's backlog was up low single digits,
driven by our catalyst business.

Advanced materials sales were up 11% on a core organic
basis, driven by demand for our Solstice global warming products as well as
higher volume in Resins & Chemicals. The Solstice growth is accelerating
even more than we had expected and we continue to build out our capacity to
meet the increasing global customer demand. In Resins & Chemicals, the
volume favorability was offset somewhat by challenging market conditions.

PMT segment margins were down 90 basis points to 20.6%, or
down 70 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. The
decline was primarily due to lower UOP petrochemical catalyst sales, partially
offset by strong improvements in margin rates in HPS and Advanced Materials.
PMT benefited from commercial excellence, the favorable impact of raw materials
pass-through in Resins & Chemicals and the impact from previous
restructuring actions.

I'm now on slide 10 with a preview of the second quarter.
For Honeywell total, we're conservatively planning for sales of $10 billion to
$10.2 billion, up 2% to 4% reported or down 2% to flat on a core organic basis.
Segment margins are expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points, excluding M&A,
or down 10 to up 10 basis points on a reported basis.

We see credible drivers to improving sales and margin
expansion for the rest of the year, including: higher catalyst sales in UOP;
higher product sales in ESS; and improving segment profit from acquisitions, as
one-time M&A-related charges taper off. We expect the tax rate to be 26.5%,
EPS is expected to be $1.61 to $1.66, up 7 % to 10% versus 2015.

Starting with Aerospace, sales are expected to be flat to up
1% on a reported and core organic basis. In Commercial Aviation OE, we're
expecting sales to be down mid single digit, driven by the impact of Aerospace
OEM incentives. Excluding the OEM incentives, Commercial Aviation OE is
expected to be up low single digit, with a ramp-up on key platforms and Air
Transport and Regional, partially offset by declines in BGA following
significant double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2015, driven by strong
engine shipments.

Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales are expected to grow
mid single digit, again, with an increase in airline spare sales improvement in
BGA RMU sales and higher repair and overall activity. ATR flight hours continue
to be strong and we're also delivering higher Satcom and other software
upgrades to enhance our growth.

We're seeing good traction from customers on our JetWave
onboard connectivity terminal which is currently undergoing certification
testing for 26 different aircraft models. Defense & Space sales are
expected to be roughly flat with higher product sales to the US government,
offset by a tough prior-year comparisons in the international business, as
larger projects are completed and by continued softness in the US services
business.

In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low
single digit, with continued strong growth in light vehicle gas applications,
partially offset by slower growth in diesel, based on the timing of new
launches. As for the Aerospace margin rates, we expect a reported increase of
60 to 80 basis points, in line with the first-quarter performance and an
increase of 80 to 100 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A.

ACS sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% on a core
organic basis, or up 9% to 11% reported, driven by the addition of Elster and
the three acquisitions we announced and closed in the first quarter. We expect
ESS sales growth to be similar in the first quarter on a core organic basis, as
continued momentum in our Security and Fire businesses and in our key
high-growth regions is more than offset by the declines we highlighted in
S&PS.

S&PS is expected to return to growth in the fourth
quarter when we lap the comparisons to periods containing the completed US
Postal Service contract. In Building Solutions & Distribution, we're
expecting low single digit core organic growth, driven primarily by continued
strength in the Americas Distribution business and in the recent improvements
in the HBS orders and backlog.

Excluding a dilutive impact from M&A, the ACS margin
rate is expected to improve 50 to 70 basis points, driven by commercial
excellence, continued productivity and the benefits of restructuring. ACS's
reported segment margin rate in the second quarter is expected to be down 20
basis points to flat. In PMT, sales are expected to be down 3% to 4%, on both
the reported and core organic basis. UOP sales are expected to improve sequentially
in the quarter but will still be down double digit on a year-over-year basis,
driven primarily by continued declines in gas processing, particularly in the
US and the timing of catalyst shipments.

Based on our stable UOP backlog and strong anticipated second-quarter
orders, we expect the catalyst business growth rates to improve in the second
half of the year. HBS sales are expected to be up low single digit on a core
organic basis, driven by continued conversion of Global Mega Projects and
higher software and services sales, partially offset by declines in sales of
field instrumentation products.

Advanced material sales are expected to be up low single
digit, driven by strength in Fluorine Products, Solstice sales and improving
specialty products volumes, partially offset by the aforementioned pricing
conditions in Resins & Chemicals. The PMT reported segment margin rate is
expected to be down 10 to 30 basis points and down 20 basis points to flat,
excluding the dilutive impact of M&A and this is driven by strong
productivity, net of inflation, and the favorable margin rate impact of the raw
materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals.

Let's move to slide 11 to discuss what to expect for the
rest of 2016. Our planning framework for 2016 contemplates a second half, core
organic sales guide of approximately 2% and our full-year guidance remains at
up 1% to 2%. There are a few drivers which we expect will contribute to this
modest second half, core organic sales growth acceleration.

We expect Aero and ACS growth rates in the second half to be
similar to the first half, so in Aerospace, we're expecting similar strong
growth in Aftermarket sales and for modest pick-ups in our Defense & Space,
and TS businesses to offset modest declines in the Commercial OE business.
We'll see tougher comps in second half of this year across Commercial Aviation
OE, which as you'll recall, grew high single digit on a core organic basis in
the second half of 2015.

In ACS, we expect S&PS business to return to growth in
the fourth quarter as we lap the tough comps stemming from the completion of
the US Postal Service contract. We also continue to see traction on our new
product investments, including the award winning Water Leak Detector, part of
the Lyric 2.0 suite of products.

This, together with ACS's continued strong performance in
high-growth regions, particularly China and India, will support continued
modest second-half growth. The majority of the improvement in the second-half
growth is expected to be driven by PMT. Our UOP business was down significantly
in the first quarter, as we discussed.

We expect a substantial improvement in catalyst sales, as
shipments accelerate on robust demand in the refining and petrochemical
segments. We also expect improvement in the other UOP businesses. UOP backlog
is healthy, up 2% at the end of the first quarter, driven by the nearly $1
billion in fourth-quarter orders in 2015 and we're expecting a robust orders
performance again in the second quarter.

So with that, let's move to our full-year 2016 guidance
summary on slide 12. As Dave mentioned earlier, we're raising the low end of
the full-year EPS guide by $0.10, with a new range of $6.55 to $6.70, up 7% to
10% over the prior year. There is some minor puts and takes among the segments from
the guidance we provided in March but overall, another very strong year
expected for Honeywell in 2016.

So if we look at Honeywell in total, we expect 1% to 2% core
organic sales growth and total sales are now expected to be between $40.3
billion and $40.9 billion, up 4% to 6% on a reported basis. This increase in
the reported sales reflects the incremental sales from the three new
acquisitions and an update to our foreign currency assumptions.

From a sales perspective, we're now planning the euro at approximately
$1.10 for the remainder of 2016, roughly in line with the prior year and up
from our previous assumption of the euro at parity with the US dollar. This
change in assumption, of course, does not impact the expected core organic
growth rate.

Segment margin expansion is expected to be up 10 to 50 basis
points, or 80 to 110 basis points, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A,
driven by commercial excellence, restructuring benefits and a continued
proactive cost management. Below segment profit, our restructuring and other
expenses remain stable and in line with our previous guidance and we still
expect a full-year tax rate to be 26.5%.

Our pension and OPEB income is expected to be approximately
$100 million higher than we anticipated in December, due to lower service and
interest costs as a result of our adoption of the spot rate methodology for our
pension plans in the US and the UK. We continue to expect our share count for
the full year to be approximately 774 million shares, or approximately 2% lower
than the 2015 weighted average share count of 789 million shares.

We plan to offset any incremental dilution from new
exercises over the course of the year to keep the share count at roughly 774
million. We've already spent over $1 billion in share repurchases in the
quarter and while our strategy to keep our share count flat over the long term
remains, we will continue to be opportunistic in our approach as the market
allows.

As I mentioned earlier, we expect free cash flow to be in a
range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to 10% from 2015 with CapEx
investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive
free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full year. And as I
said, as a result of our strong first-quarter performance and the benefit from
lower share count we are raising low end of our 2016 earnings guidance by $0.10
at this time.

Let's move to slide 16 for a quick summary before turning it
back to Mark for Q&A. Once again, we've demonstrated we can deliver on our
earnings commitments, hitting the high end of our guidance range, even in a
slow growth environment, a big reminder of the value of our diversified and
balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell Operating System.

Sales growth was better than anticipated in the quarter and
we continued to invest for future growth in new products and technologies, high
ROI CapEx, and our presence in high-growth regions. We're also continuing to
invest in and execute on process improvements and restructuring and we, again,
put to work a sizeable amount of shareowner capital which will pave the way for
future earnings and cash growth.

We have confidence in our full-year guidance based on the
tenets of supporting growth, being cautious on sales, planning cost and
spending conservatively, and continued seed planting. So while 2016 isn't the
easiest economic environment, we are confident we will continue outperforming
our peers and performing well for our shareowners.

As always, we are also thinking about what's beyond 2016.
Each of our HOS Goals Enterprise are hard at work focusing on breakthrough
goals and profitable growth that we expect will drive earnings outperformance
through our five-year plan and beyond. We look forward to sharing more over the
course of the year.

With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.

MARK MACALUSO: Thanks, Tom. Cindy, if you could please open
the line up for questioning?

Questions and Answers

OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions)

Our first question is coming from Scott Davis from Barclays.

SCOTT DAVIS, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Hi. Good morning,
guys.

DAVID COTE: Hi Scott.

SCOTT DAVIS: Well, lots here but I just wanted to get a
sense, Dave, and I know you're going to hate this question but what's the
signaling, if there is any, of making Darius COO now? I mean, I'll just leave
it at that. What are you telling us? Are you telling us you might be thinking
about retirement and this is the transition or are you telling us that you
needed -- you need this role, you need a COO-type role.

DAVID COTE: Well, I'd say that -- what I'm saying is that I
think Darius is a good guy and I don't want to lose him if I didn't promote
him. Who knows where he would have gone?

SCOTT DAVIS: I wish my boss would say that but (laughter) --
I'll move on. This -- I ask this question a lot because I don't kind of get it.
What happens with the UOP catalyst business when it goes down this much. Do you
get a snap-back? I mean, I look back at history and I couldn't find any real
trends.

How long does it take to convert orders to revenues because
it seems like your backlog is there but do things snap back or is this a
multi-quarter grind its way back?

DAVID COTE: Well, let me address it a bit and then I'll ask
Darius, who used to run that business, to weigh in a bit here. The -- it ends
up being pretty lumpy as you know, like a lot of the stuff in UOP, and we
generally can tell what's going to happen because you don't get the order right
away and ship it out like two weeks later so you do have some idea but it still
ends up being pretty lumpy overall.

And that's why we said that this first quarter was going to
be tough for us on both the growth and margins because we knew that was coming
and that was the case here. But that being said, we have a pretty good sense
for the year and what happens in the second half versus first half when it
comes to catalyst and that's what allows us to be able to be confident in what
we're saying for the rest of the year, so Darius, anything you want to add?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK, PRESIDENT & CEO - HONEYWELL PERFORMANCE
MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES, HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.: I think it's right,
Dave. What we saw in Q1 of 2015 was a very strong shipment quarter in terms of
our catalyst portfolio and even within that catalyst portfolio, there's
variability and what's very, I'll say, margin accretive set of catalyst that we
shipped back in Q1 2015, and in terms of being able to convert it, we can
generally convert it relatively fast, certainly within a quarter or at most
quarter or two.

So as Dave pointed out it can be lumpy. We had a very strong
Q1 2015 shipment and I would say at some very favorable margin rates which we
expect to get those orders back in the second half of the year.

TOM SZLOSEK: The other thing to keep in mind here is the --
this is our downstream business. It's serving refineries and petrochemical
plants, the demand for the output from those units is very strong and a lot of
our catalyst activity has to be scheduled with customer service intervals as
well so that comes into play and overall, I think you're right, Scott. The
backlog, I think, speaks for itself.

SCOTT DAVIS: Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from
JPMorgan.

STEVE TUSA, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Hi guys. Good morning.

DAVID COTE: Hi, Steve.

STEVE TUSA: Congratulations Darius.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Thank you.

STEVE TUSA: Just on the ACS margins, could you just give us
a -- definitely, we can expect that -- and you talked about the mix. Could you
maybe just give us a little bit of more color on that bridge more precisely on
what you were expecting? Where it ultimately came in? And then maybe just give
us a little bit of color on the one-time related deal stuff that kind of goes
away, either in the second quarter or over the course of the year, because you
didn't change your margin guidance for the year. And it just looks like a heck
of a ramp to ultimately get there.

DAVID COTE: Yes, I'll talk a little bit and then turn it
over to Tom. The -- in terms of the ramp, it's no different than what we were
saying back at Investor Day or back in December because this is pretty much
what we expected. It was down a little bit from what we thought on guidance,
largely because of the mix difference, as you look at what happened in the
Building Systems division which, after it felt like six or seven quarters of
saying the orders are there, it's going to come.

It finally did, which was nice. It was a good thing to see
so this is pretty much consistent with what we've been planning for all along
and as you take a look at second half growth for the total Company, as I said,
it's largely driven by the absence of negatives than it is by any big thing
that we're counting on; so, Tom?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, maybe just looking at a little bit closer
to the details, Steve, the dilutive impact from margins was from Elster and
Data Max only a little bit. But that was -- it was 150 basis points or so and
that contains probably around 40 million of one-time kinds of things but when
you -- and that's like the upfront inventory write-off and deal costs and so
forth.

So you're right, those will not be with us for the rest of
the year but that was already contemplated in our organic guidance that we had
given you so if you look at it on that basis for the first quarter, we
certainly did have the productivity impacts that we felt we were going to have.
But we had good material cost productivity, good performance on indirect, and
we actually had good performance on the commercial side. The issue was what
Dave highlighted.

We had more sales than distribution, more sales of Building
Solution products, I mean, 17% up in our Distribution business, 7% up in
Building Solution. And we also had in S&PS, a little bit of unfavorability
beyond the Postal Service contract that we talked about, a little bit of
channel softness and inventory shifts. We are keeping our eye on that as well.

So those are the puts and takes. As we said second quarter,
we expect to snap back to 50 to 70 basis points of expansion and we'll get the
productivity. I don't think the sales -- we're not planning for the -- as
market of sales growth in BSD as we had in the first quarter and we get more
restructuring benefit as we move along. That's the way I'd characterize it.

STEVE TUSA: Okay. And the S&PS thing being down, that should
have been -- that's kind of visible right? That's something you probably knew
about earlier because it's a tough comp as opposed to a change in the business
environment?

TOM SZLOSEK: We certainly knew about the US Postal contract
completion, but when you look at --

STEVE TUSA: And what else?

TOM SZLOSEK: But it's a short cycle business and we go
through indirect channels and your visibility out on those is not much more
than a few weeks, couple weeks.

DAVID COTE: And what happened on that, to Tom's point, there
were two drivers. One we knew and planned for USPS. The second one was
distributor inventory levels which declined in the quarter. And we expect will
probably decline again in the second quarter before leveling out and that one
is one that we had not anticipated; it just kind of happened but we think is,
once, as you know, the level gets to where they want it then you get back to
growth -- you get back to the end market growth again.

STEVE TUSA: Is there something -- is there an industry there
that you're seeing? Is it something having -- it seemed like a lot of the macro
inventory-related stuff has stabilized. Anything more specific than that?

DAVID COTE: No, we don't think so from an end market
perspective. It looks more like just distributors trying to be a little more
cautious.

STEVE TUSA: Okay and then one last question, just on the
below the line stuff. You mentioned you're keeping your share count guidance
the same but then you said you're raising partly because of share count
dynamics. Could you just maybe clarify below the line, what's changed? Whether
it's pension, restructuring, share count? What has helped you on the guide
because it doesn't seem like the core profit guidance has changed very much.

TOM SZLOSEK: No, that's right. The big changes are the spot
rate method on the pension side, which as we said, we fully expect to offset
that impact with additional restructuring. We have eight acquisitions that
we're integrating and when we start to carry out our cost synergy plans, we'll
really need to lean on that restructuring funding so that's the -- those are
the major movements. The raise to the guidance is a reflection of the strong
first quarter as well as the share count that we mentioned.

STEVE TUSA: Okay, thanks.

DAVID COTE: Thanks, Steve.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Steve Winoker from
Bernstein.

STEVE WINOKER, ANALYST, BERNSTEIN: Thanks and good morning,
all. Dave, I think a skeptic maybe look at some of the segment margins over
time now and this quarter, for example, even ex-M&A and say look, after
more than a decade of almost a 1,000 basis points of segment margin expansion
and well past prior peak in all cases, what are -- that's just getting harder
and harder and bumpier, for whatever reason, mix, et cetera? What would you
say? What is the one or two things you'd point to say, no, that's wrong, very
explainable as you just went through ACS, and here is why that's wrong?

DAVID COTE: Gee, an analyst skeptic; isn't that an oxymoron?

STEVE WINOKER: (laughter) Paid to be skeptics, not cynics,
Dave. (laughter)

DAVID COTE: Yes, well, first of all, we forecasted this was
going to happen in the first quarter and yes, okay, we didn't beat it by 10
basis points but we're certainly within the realm or reasonability and if you
take a look at the total years, quarters are a little more difficult, I'd say
have things move always perfectly smoothly because you have things like UOP
that just cause things not to be perfectly smooth.

On a total year basis, there's -- this is going to continue
and it's not so much where you're coming from and the 1,000 basis points, yes,
that's quite nice, but there's at least another 300 or 400 basis points left to
go if we take a look versus our high-margin rate peers and we look at the
industries that we're in and how others do in that industry. So this is going
to keep going. It's not going to change.

At some point, we will have to say yes, we are the highest
in the industry and we can't keep talking about our margin rate growth story,
but it's going to keep going. HOS Gold hasn't finished the whole idea of being
able to grow sales and hold fixed costs constant. Those are still very real and
there's still a lot of juice left for functional transformation; there's still
a lot left there.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: If I could add the -- the other thing I'd
point to, Steve is the unspent restructuring that we have. It's well over $300
million and that will continue to replenish itself. We have requests for way
more than we can fund every quarter and we think that will help it. And the
other thing is these acquisitions, I said we're integrating eight acquisitions
and when you look at the weighted average margin rate of those acquisitions for
the first quarter, it's less than 10% so that's diluting down a portfolio so as
we continue to integrate those and bring those in, that's going to be a big
driver for us as well.

STEVE WINOKER: Very helpful. Thanks and Dave, what are you
currently thinking in terms of M&A again and I know you get this question
all the time, in size and I guess also, just given a lot of investor
discussions, are there any circumstances under which you'd actually revisit
your UTX bid?

DAVID COTE: Well, starting with the second one first, no.
It's done, it's past. It had its time and that time is gone and on the first
one, while it's the same question, it's also the same answer. (laughter) It
depends. We work an active pipeline. You never know when stuff is going to hit
and sometimes, we've been really fortunate this past six, nine months with a
bunch of things that we were able to bring to fruition.

Who knows? The rest of the year, there could be another 10%
or it could be zero and we're just going to continue to be smart about it. I
still do the integration reviews like we've talked about in the past. We are
just as disciplined as we ever were; if something makes sense, we'll do it. If
we can't find stuff that makes sense, we won't. I don't mind being out of the
market for awhile and seeing what develops. We're seeing to stay sharp.

STEVE WINOKER: I'm sure you have a lot of folks in the
queue, so I'll pass it along. Thanks.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Banc
of America.

ANDREW OBIN, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Yes, good morning.

DAVID COTE: Hi, Andrew.

ANDREW OBIN: Just more a general question a lot of
conversations was investors about sort of global PMIs bottoming and bouncing
off the bottom. What are you seeing? Is the world truly reaccelerating as you
look at your business and when are we going to start seeing it in numbers? Thank
you.

DAVID COTE: Well, I'm hopeful that there's a global economic
rebound but we're certainly not going to count on it. If there was any region
that surprised me in this past quarter, it was Europe did a lot better than I
expected. I don't know if this is just a one-time bounce or something that's
going to stay consistent, but I was quite encouraged by seeing that. It was a
nice surprise.

We will see how much that turns into something, but right
now, we're going to stay with this whole idea that this is a slow growth global
environment and it's just the smart way to plan and you see that reflected in
how we are forecasting the second quarter and how we are forecasting the total
year. I just don't think there's any percentage right now on being bullish about
it.

If it happens, great. I think there's a greater chance it
happens than there is that it doesn't but that being said, I don't see any
percentage in being bullish about it.

ANDREW OBIN: Just a follow-up question. The dollar has been
going up for years and at the end, a lot of companies, you included, set up the
hedging structure. And as the dollar trade is unwinding, A, how are you
thinking about hedging in outer years? And B, other than hedging a weaker
dollar, how does it impact your strategy?

DAVID COTE: It doesn't really impact our strategy all that
much because we have never really changed the way we did it. We have always
tried to match cost and revenue as best we can so I want to be producing in the
markets we're selling and as a result of that, I think it's put us in a pretty
good position where we don't get out of whack with any competitor because of a
currency mismatch.

When it comes to the translation question, that's a separate
one. We might consider taking some exposure off the table this year and next as
we contemplate what could happen, especially as you look at practice and the
possibilities there but, by and large, I don't feel as negative as I did about
currency as I did, say, a year or two ago.

ANDREW OBIN: Thank you very much.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from
Vertical Research Partners.

JEFF SPRAGUE, ANALYST, VERTICAL RESEARCH PARTNERS: Thank
you. Good morning everyone.

DAVID COTE: Hi, Jeff.

JEFF SPRAGUE: Hi. A couple, maybe actually one for Darius
since he's on the line. I just see this morning that Grace is buying a BASS
catalyst business today. Just wondered if you could speak to whether that was
on your radar screen and maybe more generally, do you see M&A opportunities
in that space for UOP or kind of related assets in that area?

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Well, obviously, as usual, I'm not going to
comment on specific targets so quick learning from Dave, (laughter) but
obviously, the catalyst space is interesting to us. It's something that,
obviously, is core to what UOP does and I would just say that's an area that
it's something that we're -- we've been looking at both organically and if the
right opportunity presents itself, it's probably something that we'd be open to
as well but it's clearly, a space that's of interest to us.

JEFF SPRAGUE: Great and then Tom, just on tax. Honeywell,
for years, has had a very sophisticated tax planning effort, solving to 26.5%
almost precisely year after year. Is there anything in what the Treasury said a
couple weeks ago when they were aiming at inversion that kind of spills over
and increases the risk to your tax planning strategies?

TOM SZLOSEK: Well first of all, my tax director is going to
be thrilled you referred to him as sophisticated. That's going to be a new one,
but --

JEFF SPRAGUE: Of course.

TOM SZLOSEK: Just kidding. The -- well, I mean, Jeff,
(laughter) -- of course, we're not an inverted Company, Jeff, you know, but the
new rules do apply to US multinationals as well and there's specific criteria
that inter-company loans are required to meet in order to be treated as debt as
opposed to equity.

We're currently assessing all of our inter-company loans
against these criteria. We'll likely be required to have more extensive
documentation placed on our loans and it may have an impact on our ability to
pool our cash globally as well. We're currently assessing that, But otherwise,
we aren't expecting immaterial impact, including in our ability to do M&A
and including our foreign operations.

JEFF SPRAGUE: Thank you. Just one more quick one, if I
could. We're all just trying to kind of get all of the I's dotted on margins,
as you can see on this call. Just the OEM payments for the year, if you gave
that previously, I don't recall. Could you share that with us just so we have
that dialed in?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, it's roughly 200 -- a little bit over $200
million for the year. Year on year.

JEFF SPRAGUE: Year on year, $200 million?

TOM SZLOSEK: Right.

JEFF SPRAGUE: Thanks guys.

TOM SZLOSEK: You're welcome.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from
Cowen & Company.

GAUTAM KHANNA, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Yes, thank you. I
was wondering if you've seen any change in customer buying behavior in the ATR
Aero Aftermarkets. We hear a lot about pooling of parts and part-outs; wondering
if you're seeing any of that because the numbers don't suggest it.

DAVID COTE: Well, yes, those phenomena, both of those are
real and you're seeing consolidation more in China, I'd say, than any place
else and the parting-out is real. And we referenced that ourselves in previous
announcements. That being said, those are a couple headwinds but they are also
tail winds and that's flight hours, for example, where people are continuing to
fly and that's always good and they have more than offset the impact from those
other items.

GAUTAM KHANNA: And then China, your spares were up quite a
bit. Is there any -- what do you think is actually driving that? Is it a
restock? Is there -- what's going on there?

DAVID COTE: I think it comes back to flight hours again.
They fly a lot and that's really the -- I've said many times, the biggest
Aerospace driver we have is flight hours. It's not tied to OEM schedules or
airline profitability or any of that generally. The long-term trend is going to
be driven by flight hours. If they are flying -- if everything ends up working
out, whatever short-term disruptions or benefits, whatever you're seeing over
time, flight hours ends up being the driver.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Flight hours continue to climb and that's a
good phenomenon for us.

TOM SZLOSEK: I'd also add that when you look back at the
first quarter 2015, we -- there was an usually low aftermarket sales, I think
because some of the factors you had mentioned, Gautam. I think we'll continue
to see the impact of that, as Dave said, but overall for the full year, the
flight hours are what's going to be what drives our aftermarket in China.

GAUTAM KHANNA: And just to follow-up on Jeff's question on
the OEM pre-production payments, do you have any preliminary sense for what they
might be in 2017?

TOM SZLOSEK: I think the level will be similar in total to
2016, so flat year over year. And then it should recede in the years after
that.

GAUTAM KHANNA: Okay and last one. Can you quantify the USPS
headwind for us quarter over quarter what the decline has been?

DAVID COTE: In general, that's not the kind of specifics we
would share. We would say that, as I said, we knew about some of it. We did not
know about the distributor side of it so that was a surprise but that will,
like any other inventory reduction, that corrects itself over time.

GAUTAM KHANNA: Right. Thank you very much.

DAVID COTE: You're welcome.

OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Nigel Coe from
Morgan Stanley.

NIGEL COE, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Yes, thanks for running
a bit late here as well. Darius, congratulations on the role. Fantastic.

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: Thank you.

NIGEL COE: We've spent a lot of time talking about catalyst
and I apologize for another question here, but it is a big swing between first
half and second half. Typically, how much visibility do you have an catalyst
bed reloads? Is it three months? Is it six months? I mean, and how much
variabilities do you have once you have a job in the backlog? How much --
typically how much variability is there in the timing of that. I can't imagine
it's much but if you maybe just comment on that, please.

DAVID COTE: Well, it's a mixture. There's stuff that we know
about a long time ahead because some customers place orders a long time ahead;
others don't, but Darius, you know better than --

DARIUS ADAMCZYK: I think when it comes to the second part of
your question, which is once it's in the backlog, we can produce it fairly
quickly, typically within three months. So I think the cycle, the conversion
cycle time from booking to revenue is relatively short. In terms of
visibilities to when the orders come in, frankly, the visibility isn't great.

It's a bit of a random function and Tom referred to this
earlier, but one of the fundamental things that's going on, this is actually
pretty good time for refiners so with what we're seeing is that refiners are
actually putting off their turnarounds which they are going to have to incur at
some point. When that's going to happen, that's not really certain, but I would
say, overall, the catalyst booking pattern is somewhat unpredictable.

NIGEL COE: Okay so the second half view is best assets, but
not locked in by any stress of measures. Okay. And then obviously, you're
getting beaten up a little bit on margin this quarter. Obviously, there's a lot
of moving parts with the OE and full payments and the FX hedge. I guess the
average margin strength, given those two headwinds is pretty extraordinary but
just Tom, maybe just comment on the hedge, the Euro hedge and if, by some
miracle, the Euro did go to $1.24 by year end, that's still a benefit to your
guide net-net but obviously, that will tax your margins somewhat; is that the
right way to think about it?

TOM SZLOSEK: No, if you'll recall, Nigel, at the beginning
of -- towards the tail end of last year, we basically hedged the Euro. Our
Euro-based profit is the way to think about it, so they're hedged at about
$1.10, at the income level. Right. The profits are. The movement in our
guidance was on reported sales so we've never hedged it at the sales line
level, so we do see the variability if the US dollar goes to -- if we go to
$1.24 in your scenario, then yes, we would have more sales but our margins
would be the same so that would have an impact on the margin rate.

DAVID COTE: It's why we take out the difference between
operational and all of the other items on the margin rate curve.

NIGEL COE: Okay and just a quick one on inventories. The
Building inventories, is that driven by the Aero build cycle?

TOM SZLOSEK: Yes, you've got a couple things going on in
inventories. That's -- I'd say the biggest thing is continuing to ramp up for
foreign products. We've got significant pick-up in, as we said, in second half
there and the other thing is the M&A. More than half of it is of the inventory
increase is from the acquisitions that we've done.

NIGEL COE: Of course, yes. Okay, thanks guys.

DAVID COTE: Thanks.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from
Citi.

ANDREW KAPLOWITZ, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Hi. Good morning,
guys.

DAVID COTE: Hi.

ANDREW KAPLOWITZ: Dave, the TS business seemed to pick up in
1Q. Can you talk about the improvement a little bit more? How did commercial
vehicles do in the quarter, is it just easier comparisons there, being in
take-hold, and can you sustain the mid-single digit growth that you've seen
going forward?

DAVID COTE: Well, Commercial is still tough on the TS side;
what you're seeing more with -- were the benefits of the wins in the passenger
vehicle side.

ANDREW KAPLOWITZ: Okay, that's easy and then Dave, just -- I
know the answer to this but I'm asking anyway. Can you talk about your organic
growth guidance in 2Q or is the 1% growth you had in 1Q, is it getting worse in
portfolio in Aero and ACS that leads to lower growth or is it just conservatism
and you're not forecasting BSD accelerated growth that you saw in the quarter?

DAVID COTE: I would say that it's more a case where we want
to stay careful, but there's nothing that says that there's a disaster coming
in the second quarter or anything like that. We just want to make sure we stay
conservative and hopefully, the first-quarter performance continues on organic
growth but we'd hate to count on it, not have it happen and I'd rather have it
be the other way around.

ANDREW KAPLOWITZ: Appreciate it.

DAVID COTE: You're welcome.

OPERATOR: That is all the time we have for today's
question-and-answer session. Mr. Cote, at this time, I'll turn the conference
back to you for any additional or closing remarks.

DAVID COTE: Well, we're quite pleased to outperform again
this quarter. And what we accomplished on organic sales growth, beating our
commitments and the productivity generated to offset the known headwinds, gives
us the confidence to raise the low end of our EPS guidance by $0.10. We're
encouraged by what we're accomplishing this year and next and of course, we all
hope that you feel the same way. Thanks.

OPERATOR: Thank you. This does conclude today's
teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful
day.
